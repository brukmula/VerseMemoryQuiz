01001001 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
01001002 Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
01001003 And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.
01001004 God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.
01001005 God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.
01001006 And God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.”
01001007 So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so.
01001008 God called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.
01001009 And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so.
01001010 God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good.
01001011 Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so.
01001012 The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
01001013 And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.
01001014 And God said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years,
01001015 and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so.
01001016 God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars.
01001017 God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth,
01001018 to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good.
01001019 And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.
01001020 And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.”
01001021 So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
01001022 God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.”
01001023 And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.
01001024 And God said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so.
01001025 God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
01001026 Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”
01001027 So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.
01001028 God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”
01001029 Then God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.
01001030 And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food.” And it was so.
01001031 God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day.
01002001 Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.
01002002 By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.
01002003 Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.
01002004 This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.
01002005 Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth and no plant had yet sprung up, for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground,
01002006 but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.
01002007 Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.
01002008 Now the Lord God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed.
01002009 The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground—trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
01002010 A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters.
01002011 The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.
01002012 (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also there.)
01002013 The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.
01002014 The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
01002015 The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.
01002016 And the Lord God commanded the man, “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden;
01002017 but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.”
01002018 The Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.”
01002019 Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.
01002020 So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals. But for Adam no suitable helper was found.
01002021 So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man’s ribs and then closed up the place with flesh.
01002022 Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.
01002023 The man said, “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called ‘woman,’ for she was taken out of man.”
01002024 That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.
01002025 Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.
01003001 Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?”
01003002 The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,
01003003 but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’ ”
01003004 “You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman.
01003005 “For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”
01003006 When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.
01003007 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
01003008 Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden.
01003009 But the Lord God called to the man, “Where are you?”
01003010 He answered, “I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.”
01003011 And he said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”
01003012 The man said, “The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”
01003013 Then the Lord God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”
01003014 So the Lord God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, “Cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.
01003015 And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.”
01003016 To the woman he said, “I will make your pains in childbearing very severe; with painful labor you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.”
01003017 To Adam he said, “Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, ‘You must not eat from it,’ “Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life.
01003018 It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.
01003019 By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return.”
01003020 Adam named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living.
01003021 The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.
01003022 And the Lord God said, “The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.”
01003023 So the Lord God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.
01003024 After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.
01004001 Adam made love to his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, “With the help of the Lord I have brought forth a man.”
01004002 Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil.
01004003 In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord.
01004004 And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering,
01004005 but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.
01004006 Then the Lord said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?
01004007 If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.”
01004008 Now Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let’s go out to the field.” While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.
01004009 Then the Lord said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” “I don’t know,” he replied. “Am I my brother’s keeper?”
01004010 The Lord said, “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground.
01004011 Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.
01004012 When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.”
01004013 Cain said to the Lord, “My punishment is more than I can bear.
01004014 Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.”
01004015 But the Lord said to him, “Not so ; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.” Then the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.
01004016 So Cain went out from the Lord’s presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
01004017 Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch.
01004018 To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.
01004019 Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.
01004020 Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.
01004021 His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes.
01004022 Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain’s sister was Naamah.
01004023 Lamech said to his wives, “Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.
01004024 If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times.”
01004025 Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, “God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.”
01004026 Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to call on the name of the Lord.
01005001 This is the written account of Adam’s family line. When God created mankind, he made them in the likeness of God.
01005002 He created them male and female and blessed them. And he named them “Mankind” when they were created.
01005003 When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son in his own likeness, in his own image; and he named him Seth.
01005004 After Seth was born, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.
01005005 Altogether, Adam lived a total of 930 years, and then he died.
01005006 When Seth had lived 105 years, he became the father of Enosh.
01005007 After he became the father of Enosh, Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters.
01005008 Altogether, Seth lived a total of 912 years, and then he died.
01005009 When Enosh had lived 90 years, he became the father of Kenan.
01005010 After he became the father of Kenan, Enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters.
01005011 Altogether, Enosh lived a total of 905 years, and then he died.
01005012 When Kenan had lived 70 years, he became the father of Mahalalel.
01005013 After he became the father of Mahalalel, Kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters.
01005014 Altogether, Kenan lived a total of 910 years, and then he died.
01005015 When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he became the father of Jared.
01005016 After he became the father of Jared, Mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters.
01005017 Altogether, Mahalalel lived a total of 895 years, and then he died.
01005018 When Jared had lived 162 years, he became the father of Enoch.
01005019 After he became the father of Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.
01005020 Altogether, Jared lived a total of 962 years, and then he died.
01005021 When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah.
01005022 After he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked faithfully with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters.
01005023 Altogether, Enoch lived a total of 365 years.
01005024 Enoch walked faithfully with God; then he was no more, because God took him away.
01005025 When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he became the father of Lamech.
01005026 After he became the father of Lamech, Methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters.
01005027 Altogether, Methuselah lived a total of 969 years, and then he died.
01005028 When Lamech had lived 182 years, he had a son.
01005029 He named him Noah and said, “He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the Lord has cursed.”
01005030 After Noah was born, Lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters.
01005031 Altogether, Lamech lived a total of 777 years, and then he died.
01005032 After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham and Japheth.
01006001 When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them,
01006002 the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose.
01006003 Then the Lord said, “My Spirit will not contend with humans forever, for they are mortal ; their days will be a hundred and twenty years.”
01006004 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.
01006005 The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time.
01006006 The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled.
01006007 So the Lord said, “I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them.”
01006008 But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.
01006009 This is the account of Noah and his family. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God.
01006010 Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth.
01006011 Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight and was full of violence.
01006012 God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways.
01006013 So God said to Noah, “I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth.
01006014 So make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.
01006015 This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high.
01006016 Make a roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit high all around. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks.
01006017 I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish.
01006018 But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you.
01006019 You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you.
01006020 Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive.
01006021 You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.”
01006022 Noah did everything just as God commanded him.
01007001 The Lord then said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you righteous in this generation.
01007002 Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and one pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate,
01007003 and also seven pairs of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth.
01007004 Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made.”
01007005 And Noah did all that the Lord commanded him.
01007006 Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth.
01007007 And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood.
01007008 Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground,
01007009 male and female, came to Noah and entered the ark, as God had commanded Noah.
01007010 And after the seven days the floodwaters came on the earth.
01007011 In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, on the seventeenth day of the second month—on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.
01007012 And rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.
01007013 On that very day Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark.
01007014 They had with them every wild animal according to its kind, all livestock according to their kinds, every creature that moves along the ground according to its kind and every bird according to its kind, everything with wings.
01007015 Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark.
01007016 The animals going in were male and female of every living thing, as God had commanded Noah. Then the Lord shut him in.
01007017 For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth.
01007018 The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water.
01007019 They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered.
01007020 The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than fifteen cubits.
01007021 Every living thing that moved on land perished—birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind.
01007022 Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.
01007023 Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; people and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark.
01007024 The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days.
01008001 But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and he sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded.
01008002 Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from the sky.
01008003 The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down,
01008004 and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
01008005 The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible.
01008006 After forty days Noah opened a window he had made in the ark
01008007 and sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth.
01008008 Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground.
01008009 But the dove could find nowhere to perch because there was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark.
01008010 He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark.
01008011 When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth.
01008012 He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him.
01008013 By the first day of the first month of Noah’s six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.
01008014 By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry.
01008015 Then God said to Noah,
01008016 “Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives.
01008017 Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you—the birds, the animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground—so they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number on it.”
01008018 So Noah came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives.
01008019 All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds—everything that moves on land—came out of the ark, one kind after another.
01008020 Then Noah built an altar to the Lord and, taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it.
01008021 The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: “Never again will I curse the ground because of humans, even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done.
01008022 “As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will never cease.”
01009001 Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth.
01009002 The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth, and on all the birds in the sky, on every creature that moves along the ground, and on all the fish in the sea; they are given into your hands.
01009003 Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.
01009004 “But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it.
01009005 And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. And from each human being, too, I will demand an accounting for the life of another human being.
01009006 “Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made mankind.
01009007 As for you, be fruitful and increase in number; multiply on the earth and increase upon it.”
01009008 Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him:
01009009 “I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you
01009010 and with every living creature that was with you—the birds, the livestock and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you—every living creature on earth.
01009011 I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.”
01009012 And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come:
01009013 I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
01009014 Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds,
01009015 I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life.
01009016 Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth.”
01009017 So God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth.”
01009018 The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.)
01009019 These were the three sons of Noah, and from them came the people who were scattered over the whole earth.
01009020 Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded to plant a vineyard.
01009021 When he drank some of its wine, he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent.
01009022 Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his two brothers outside.
01009023 But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders; then they walked in backward and covered their father’s naked body. Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their father naked.
01009024 When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him,
01009025 he said, “Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers.”
01009026 He also said, “Praise be to the Lord, the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem.
01009027 May God extend Japheth’s territory; may Japheth live in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be the slave of Japheth.”
01009028 After the flood Noah lived 350 years.
01009029 Noah lived a total of 950 years, and then he died.
01010001 This is the account of Shem, Ham and Japheth, Noah’s sons, who themselves had sons after the flood.
01010002 The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshek and Tiras.
01010003 The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath and Togarmah.
01010004 The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittites and the Rodanites.
01010005 (From these the maritime peoples spread out into their territories by their clans within their nations, each with its own language.)
01010006 The sons of Ham: Cush, Egypt, Put and Canaan.
01010007 The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah and Sabteka. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
01010008 Cush was the father of Nimrod, who became a mighty warrior on the earth.
01010009 He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; that is why it is said, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord.”
01010010 The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon, Uruk, Akkad and Kalneh, in Shinar.
01010011 From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah
01010012 and Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah—which is the great city.
01010013 Egypt was the father of the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites,
01010014 Pathrusites, Kasluhites (from whom the Philistines came) and Caphtorites.
01010015 Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites,
01010016 Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites,
01010017 Hivites, Arkites, Sinites,
01010018 Arvadites, Zemarites and Hamathites. Later the Canaanite clans scattered
01010019 and the borders of Canaan reached from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboyim, as far as Lasha.
01010020 These are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.
01010021 Sons were also born to Shem, whose older brother was Japheth; Shem was the ancestor of all the sons of Eber.
01010022 The sons of Shem: Elam, Ashur, Arphaxad, Lud and Aram.
01010023 The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether and Meshek.
01010024 Arphaxad was the father of Shelah, and Shelah the father of Eber.
01010025 Two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg, because in his time the earth was divided; his brother was named Joktan.
01010026 Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
01010027 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
01010028 Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
01010029 Ophir, Havilah and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan.
01010030 The region where they lived stretched from Mesha toward Sephar, in the eastern hill country.
01010031 These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.
01010032 These are the clans of Noah’s sons, according to their lines of descent, within their nations. From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood.
01011001 Now the whole world had one language and a common speech.
01011002 As people moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.
01011003 They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar.
01011004 Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”
01011005 But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building.
01011006 The Lord said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.
01011007 Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.”
01011008 So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city.
01011009 That is why it was called Babel —because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth.
01011010 This is the account of Shem’s family line. Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father of Arphaxad.
01011011 And after he became the father of Arphaxad, Shem lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters.
01011012 When Arphaxad had lived 35 years, he became the father of Shelah.
01011013 And after he became the father of Shelah, Arphaxad lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
01011014 When Shelah had lived 30 years, he became the father of Eber.
01011015 And after he became the father of Eber, Shelah lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
01011016 When Eber had lived 34 years, he became the father of Peleg.
01011017 And after he became the father of Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters.
01011018 When Peleg had lived 30 years, he became the father of Reu.
01011019 And after he became the father of Reu, Peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters.
01011020 When Reu had lived 32 years, he became the father of Serug.
01011021 And after he became the father of Serug, Reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters.
01011022 When Serug had lived 30 years, he became the father of Nahor.
01011023 And after he became the father of Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and had other sons and daughters.
01011024 When Nahor had lived 29 years, he became the father of Terah.
01011025 And after he became the father of Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters.
01011026 After Terah had lived 70 years, he became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran.
01011027 This is the account of Terah’s family line. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran. And Haran became the father of Lot.
01011028 While his father Terah was still alive, Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans, in the land of his birth.
01011029 Abram and Nahor both married. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milkah; she was the daughter of Haran, the father of both Milkah and Iskah.
01011030 Now Sarai was childless because she was not able to conceive.
01011031 Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, the wife of his son Abram, and together they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to Canaan. But when they came to Harran, they settled there.
01011032 Terah lived 205 years, and he died in Harran.
01012001 The Lord had said to Abram, “Go from your country, your people and your father’s household to the land I will show you.
01012002 “I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.
01012003 I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.”
01012004 So Abram went, as the Lord had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he set out from Harran.
01012005 He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in Harran, and they set out for the land of Canaan, and they arrived there.
01012006 Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great tree of Moreh at Shechem. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.
01012007 The Lord appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” So he built an altar there to the Lord, who had appeared to him.
01012008 From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the Lord and called on the name of the Lord.
01012009 Then Abram set out and continued toward the Negev.
01012010 Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe.
01012011 As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “I know what a beautiful woman you are.
01012012 When the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me but will let you live.
01012013 Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you.”
01012014 When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was a very beautiful woman.
01012015 And when Pharaoh’s officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace.
01012016 He treated Abram well for her sake, and Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels.
01012017 But the Lord inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Abram’s wife Sarai.
01012018 So Pharaoh summoned Abram. “What have you done to me?” he said. “Why didn’t you tell me she was your wife?
01012019 Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!”
01012020 Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything he had.
01013001 So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, with his wife and everything he had, and Lot went with him.
01013002 Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold.
01013003 From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier
01013004 and where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of the Lord.
01013005 Now Lot, who was moving about with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents.
01013006 But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together.
01013007 And quarreling arose between Abram’s herders and Lot’s. The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time.
01013008 So Abram said to Lot, “Let’s not have any quarreling between you and me, or between your herders and mine, for we are close relatives.
01013009 Is not the whole land before you? Let’s part company. If you go to the left, I’ll go to the right; if you go to the right, I’ll go to the left.”
01013010 Lot looked around and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan toward Zoar was well watered, like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt. (This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)
01013011 So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company:
01013012 Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom.
01013013 Now the people of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the Lord.
01013014 The Lord said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, “Look around from where you are, to the north and south, to the east and west.
01013015 All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring forever.
01013016 I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted.
01013017 Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you.”
01013018 So Abram went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he pitched his tents. There he built an altar to the Lord.
01014001 At the time when Amraphel was king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goyim,
01014002 these kings went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboyim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).
01014003 All these latter kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Dead Sea Valley).
01014004 For twelve years they had been subject to Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
01014005 In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim
01014006 and the Horites in the hill country of Seir, as far as El Paran near the desert.
01014007 Then they turned back and went to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who were living in Hazezon Tamar.
01014008 Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboyim and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) marched out and drew up their battle lines in the Valley of Siddim
01014009 against Kedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goyim, Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five.
01014010 Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of the men fell into them and the rest fled to the hills.
01014011 The four kings seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food; then they went away.
01014012 They also carried off Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions, since he was living in Sodom.
01014013 A man who had escaped came and reported this to Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram was living near the great trees of Mamre the Amorite, a brother of Eshkol and Aner, all of whom were allied with Abram.
01014014 When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.
01014015 During the night Abram divided his men to attack them and he routed them, pursuing them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus.
01014016 He recovered all the goods and brought back his relative Lot and his possessions, together with the women and the other people.
01014017 After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley).
01014018 Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High,
01014019 and he blessed Abram, saying, “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth.
01014020 And praise be to God Most High, who delivered your enemies into your hand.” Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
01014021 The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people and keep the goods for yourself.”
01014022 But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “With raised hand I have sworn an oath to the Lord, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,
01014023 that I will accept nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or the strap of a sandal, so that you will never be able to say, ‘I made Abram rich.’
01014024 I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to the men who went with me—to Aner, Eshkol and Mamre. Let them have their share.”
01015001 After this, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your very great reward. ”
01015002 But Abram said, “Sovereign Lord, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?”
01015003 And Abram said, “You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir.”
01015004 Then the word of the Lord came to him: “This man will not be your heir, but a son who is your own flesh and blood will be your heir.”
01015005 He took him outside and said, “Look up at the sky and count the stars—if indeed you can count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring be.”
01015006 Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness.
01015007 He also said to him, “I am the Lord, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it.”
01015008 But Abram said, “Sovereign Lord, how can I know that I will gain possession of it?”
01015009 So the Lord said to him, “Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon.”
01015010 Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half.
01015011 Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.
01015012 As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him.
01015013 Then the Lord said to him, “Know for certain that for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and that they will be enslaved and mistreated there.
01015014 But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions.
01015015 You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age.
01015016 In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.”
01015017 When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces.
01015018 On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram and said, “To your descendants I give this land, from the Wadi of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates—
01015019 the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,
01015020 Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,
01015021 Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.”
01016001 Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar;
01016002 so she said to Abram, “The Lord has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my slave; perhaps I can build a family through her.” Abram agreed to what Sarai said.
01016003 So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian slave Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife.
01016004 He slept with Hagar, and she conceived. When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.
01016005 Then Sarai said to Abram, “You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my slave in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the Lord judge between you and me.”
01016006 “Your slave is in your hands,” Abram said. “Do with her whatever you think best.” Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her.
01016007 The angel of the Lord found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur.
01016008 And he said, “Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?” “I’m running away from my mistress Sarai,” she answered.
01016009 Then the angel of the Lord told her, “Go back to your mistress and submit to her.”
01016010 The angel added, “I will increase your descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count.”
01016011 The angel of the Lord also said to her: “You are now pregnant and you will give birth to a son. You shall name him Ishmael, for the Lord has heard of your misery.
01016012 He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone’s hand against him, and he will live in hostility toward all his brothers.”
01016013 She gave this name to the Lord who spoke to her: “You are the God who sees me,” for she said, “I have now seen the One who sees me.”
01016014 That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi ; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered.
01016015 So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.
01016016 Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.
01017001 When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to him and said, “I am God Almighty ; walk before me faithfully and be blameless.
01017002 Then I will make my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase your numbers.”
01017003 Abram fell facedown, and God said to him,
01017004 “As for me, this is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations.
01017005 No longer will you be called Abram ; your name will be Abraham, for I have made you a father of many nations.
01017006 I will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you.
01017007 I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you.
01017008 The whole land of Canaan, where you now reside as a foreigner, I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you; and I will be their God.”
01017009 Then God said to Abraham, “As for you, you must keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you for the generations to come.
01017010 This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you, the covenant you are to keep: Every male among you shall be circumcised.
01017011 You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you.
01017012 For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised, including those born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner—those who are not your offspring.
01017013 Whether born in your household or bought with your money, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting covenant.
01017014 Any uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.”
01017015 God also said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah.
01017016 I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.”
01017017 Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, “Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?”
01017018 And Abraham said to God, “If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!”
01017019 Then God said, “Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.
01017020 And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation.
01017021 But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year.”
01017022 When he had finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him.
01017023 On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or bought with his money, every male in his household, and circumcised them, as God told him.
01017024 Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised,
01017025 and his son Ishmael was thirteen;
01017026 Abraham and his son Ishmael were both circumcised on that very day.
01017027 And every male in Abraham’s household, including those born in his household or bought from a foreigner, was circumcised with him.
01018001 The Lord appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent in the heat of the day.
01018002 Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground.
01018003 He said, “If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, do not pass your servant by.
01018004 Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree.
01018005 Let me get you something to eat, so you can be refreshed and then go on your way—now that you have come to your servant.” “Very well,” they answered, “do as you say.”
01018006 So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. “Quick,” he said, “get three seahs of the finest flour and knead it and bake some bread.”
01018007 Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it.
01018008 He then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them. While they ate, he stood near them under a tree.
01018009 “Where is your wife Sarah?” they asked him. “There, in the tent,” he said.
01018010 Then one of them said, “I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son.” Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him.
01018011 Abraham and Sarah were already very old, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing.
01018012 So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, “After I am worn out and my lord is old, will I now have this pleasure?”
01018013 Then the Lord said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Will I really have a child, now that I am old?’
01018014 Is anything too hard for the Lord? I will return to you at the appointed time next year, and Sarah will have a son.”
01018015 Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, “I did not laugh.” But he said, “Yes, you did laugh.”
01018016 When the men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way.
01018017 Then the Lord said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?
01018018 Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him.
01018019 For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is right and just, so that the Lord will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him.”
01018020 Then the Lord said, “The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous
01018021 that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know.”
01018022 The men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the Lord.
01018023 Then Abraham approached him and said: “Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
01018024 What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it?
01018025 Far be it from you to do such a thing—to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?”
01018026 The Lord said, “If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.”
01018027 Then Abraham spoke up again: “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes,
01018028 what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five people?” “If I find forty-five there,” he said, “I will not destroy it.”
01018029 Once again he spoke to him, “What if only forty are found there?” He said, “For the sake of forty, I will not do it.”
01018030 Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?” He answered, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”
01018031 Abraham said, “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?” He said, “For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.”
01018032 Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?” He answered, “For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.”
01018033 When the Lord had finished speaking with Abraham, he left, and Abraham returned home.
01019001 The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground.
01019002 “My lords,” he said, “please turn aside to your servant’s house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.” “No,” they answered, “we will spend the night in the square.”
01019003 But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate.
01019004 Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house.
01019005 They called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.”
01019006 Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him
01019007 and said, “No, my friends. Don’t do this wicked thing.
01019008 Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don’t do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.”
01019009 “Get out of our way,” they replied. “This fellow came here as a foreigner, and now he wants to play the judge! We’ll treat you worse than them.” They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door.
01019010 But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door.
01019011 Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door.
01019012 The two men said to Lot, “Do you have anyone else here—sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here,
01019013 because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it.”
01019014 So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said, “Hurry and get out of this place, because the Lord is about to destroy the city!” But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.
01019015 With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished.”
01019016 When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the Lord was merciful to them.
01019017 As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, “Flee for your lives! Don’t look back, and don’t stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!”
01019018 But Lot said to them, “No, my lords, please!
01019019 Your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can’t flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I’ll die.
01019020 Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it—it is very small, isn’t it? Then my life will be spared.”
01019021 He said to him, “Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of.
01019022 But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it.” (That is why the town was called Zoar. )
01019023 By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land.
01019024 Then the Lord rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the Lord out of the heavens.
01019025 Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, destroying all those living in the cities—and also the vegetation in the land.
01019026 But Lot’s wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
01019027 Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the Lord.
01019028 He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.
01019029 So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.
01019030 Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave.
01019031 One day the older daughter said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man around here to give us children—as is the custom all over the earth.
01019032 Let’s get our father to drink wine and then sleep with him and preserve our family line through our father.”
01019033 That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and slept with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.
01019034 The next day the older daughter said to the younger, “Last night I slept with my father. Let’s get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.”
01019035 So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.
01019036 So both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father.
01019037 The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab ; he is the father of the Moabites of today.
01019038 The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi ; he is the father of the Ammonites of today.
01020001 Now Abraham moved on from there into the region of the Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur. For a while he stayed in Gerar,
01020002 and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” Then Abimelek king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her.
01020003 But God came to Abimelek in a dream one night and said to him, “You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.”
01020004 Now Abimelek had not gone near her, so he said, “Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?
01020005 Did he not say to me, ‘She is my sister,’ and didn’t she also say, ‘He is my brother’? I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands.”
01020006 Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.
01020007 Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all who belong to you will die.”
01020008 Early the next morning Abimelek summoned all his officials, and when he told them all that had happened, they were very much afraid.
01020009 Then Abimelek called Abraham in and said, “What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done.”
01020010 And Abimelek asked Abraham, “What was your reason for doing this?”
01020011 Abraham replied, “I said to myself, ‘There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’
01020012 Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife.
01020013 And when God had me wander from my father’s household, I said to her, ‘This is how you can show your love to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, “He is my brother.” ’ ”
01020014 Then Abimelek brought sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and he returned Sarah his wife to him.
01020015 And Abimelek said, “My land is before you; live wherever you like.”
01020016 To Sarah he said, “I am giving your brother a thousand shekels of silver. This is to cover the offense against you before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated.”
01020017 Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelek, his wife and his female slaves so they could have children again,
01020018 for the Lord had kept all the women in Abimelek’s household from conceiving because of Abraham’s wife Sarah.
01021001 Now the Lord was gracious to Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did for Sarah what he had promised.
01021002 Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him.
01021003 Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah bore him.
01021004 When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God commanded him.
01021005 Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
01021006 Sarah said, “God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me.”
01021007 And she added, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”
01021008 The child grew and was weaned, and on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham held a great feast.
01021009 But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking,
01021010 and she said to Abraham, “Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac.”
01021011 The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son.
01021012 But God said to him, “Do not be so distressed about the boy and your slave woman. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.
01021013 I will make the son of the slave into a nation also, because he is your offspring.”
01021014 Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy. She went on her way and wandered in the Desert of Beersheba.
01021015 When the water in the skin was gone, she put the boy under one of the bushes.
01021016 Then she went off and sat down about a bowshot away, for she thought, “I cannot watch the boy die.” And as she sat there, she began to sob.
01021017 God heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What is the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid; God has heard the boy crying as he lies there.
01021018 Lift the boy up and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.”
01021019 Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.
01021020 God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became an archer.
01021021 While he was living in the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt.
01021022 At that time Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces said to Abraham, “God is with you in everything you do.
01021023 Now swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my descendants. Show to me and the country where you now reside as a foreigner the same kindness I have shown to you.”
01021024 Abraham said, “I swear it.”
01021025 Then Abraham complained to Abimelek about a well of water that Abimelek’s servants had seized.
01021026 But Abimelek said, “I don’t know who has done this. You did not tell me, and I heard about it only today.”
01021027 So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelek, and the two men made a treaty.
01021028 Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock,
01021029 and Abimelek asked Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves?”
01021030 He replied, “Accept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well.”
01021031 So that place was called Beersheba, because the two men swore an oath there.
01021032 After the treaty had been made at Beersheba, Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces returned to the land of the Philistines.
01021033 Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the Lord, the Eternal God.
01021034 And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time.
01022001 Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, “Abraham!” “Here I am,” he replied.
01022002 Then God said, “Take your son, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.”
01022003 Early the next morning Abraham got up and loaded his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told him about.
01022004 On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.
01022005 He said to his servants, “Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you.”
01022006 Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together,
01022007 Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, “Father?” “Yes, my son?” Abraham replied. “The fire and wood are here,” Isaac said, “but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”
01022008 Abraham answered, “God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” And the two of them went on together.
01022009 When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.
01022010 Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.
01022011 But the angel of the Lord called out to him from heaven, “Abraham! Abraham!” “Here I am,” he replied.
01022012 “Do not lay a hand on the boy,” he said. “Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son.”
01022013 Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram caught by its horns. He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son.
01022014 So Abraham called that place The Lord Will Provide. And to this day it is said, “On the mountain of the Lord it will be provided.”
01022015 The angel of the Lord called to Abraham from heaven a second time
01022016 and said, “I swear by myself, declares the Lord, that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,
01022017 I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies,
01022018 and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed me.”
01022019 Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they set off together for Beersheba. And Abraham stayed in Beersheba.
01022020 Some time later Abraham was told, “Milkah is also a mother; she has borne sons to your brother Nahor:
01022021 Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel (the father of Aram),
01022022 Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel.”
01022023 Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milkah bore these eight sons to Abraham’s brother Nahor.
01022024 His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also had sons: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash and Maakah.
01023001 Sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven years old.
01023002 She died at Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her.
01023003 Then Abraham rose from beside his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites. He said,
01023004 “I am a foreigner and stranger among you. Sell me some property for a burial site here so I can bury my dead.”
01023005 The Hittites replied to Abraham,
01023006 “Sir, listen to us. You are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead.”
01023007 Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land, the Hittites.
01023008 He said to them, “If you are willing to let me bury my dead, then listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf
01023009 so he will sell me the cave of Machpelah, which belongs to him and is at the end of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among you.”
01023010 Ephron the Hittite was sitting among his people and he replied to Abraham in the hearing of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city.
01023011 “No, my lord,” he said. “Listen to me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. I give it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead.”
01023012 Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land
01023013 and he said to Ephron in their hearing, “Listen to me, if you will. I will pay the price of the field. Accept it from me so I can bury my dead there.”
01023014 Ephron answered Abraham,
01023015 “Listen to me, my lord; the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver, but what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.”
01023016 Abraham agreed to Ephron’s terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weight current among the merchants.
01023017 So Ephron’s field in Machpelah near Mamre—both the field and the cave in it, and all the trees within the borders of the field—was deeded
01023018 to Abraham as his property in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of the city.
01023019 Afterward Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre (which is at Hebron) in the land of Canaan.
01023020 So the field and the cave in it were deeded to Abraham by the Hittites as a burial site.
01024001 Abraham was now very old, and the Lord had blessed him in every way.
01024002 He said to the senior servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, “Put your hand under my thigh.
01024003 I want you to swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living,
01024004 but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac.”
01024005 The servant asked him, “What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?”
01024006 “Make sure that you do not take my son back there,” Abraham said.
01024007 “The Lord, the God of heaven, who brought me out of my father’s household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, ‘To your offspring I will give this land’—he will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there.
01024008 If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there.”
01024009 So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.
01024010 Then the servant left, taking with him ten of his master’s camels loaded with all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim and made his way to the town of Nahor.
01024011 He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water.
01024012 Then he prayed, “Lord, God of my master Abraham, make me successful today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.
01024013 See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water.
01024014 May it be that when I say to a young woman, ‘Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,’ and she says, ‘Drink, and I’ll water your camels too’—let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.”
01024015 Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milkah, who was the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor.
01024016 The woman was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had ever slept with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again.
01024017 The servant hurried to meet her and said, “Please give me a little water from your jar.”
01024018 “Drink, my lord,” she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink.
01024019 After she had given him a drink, she said, “I’ll draw water for your camels too, until they have had enough to drink.”
01024020 So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels.
01024021 Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the Lord had made his journey successful.
01024022 When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels.
01024023 Then he asked, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?”
01024024 She answered him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milkah bore to Nahor.”
01024025 And she added, “We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night.”
01024026 Then the man bowed down and worshiped the Lord,
01024027 saying, “Praise be to the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the Lord has led me on the journey to the house of my master’s relatives.”
01024028 The young woman ran and told her mother’s household about these things.
01024029 Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he hurried out to the man at the spring.
01024030 As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s arms, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring.
01024031 “Come, you who are blessed by the Lord,” he said. “Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.”
01024032 So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet.
01024033 Then food was set before him, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say.” “Then tell us,” Laban said.
01024034 So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant.
01024035 The Lord has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become wealthy. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys.
01024036 My master’s wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns.
01024037 And my master made me swear an oath, and said, ‘You must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,
01024038 but go to my father’s family and to my own clan, and get a wife for my son.’
01024039 “Then I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not come back with me?’
01024040 “He replied, ‘The Lord, before whom I have walked faithfully, will send his angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my father’s family.
01024041 You will be released from my oath if, when you go to my clan, they refuse to give her to you—then you will be released from my oath.’
01024042 “When I came to the spring today, I said, ‘Lord, God of my master Abraham, if you will, please grant success to the journey on which I have come.
01024043 See, I am standing beside this spring. If a young woman comes out to draw water and I say to her, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar,”
01024044 and if she says to me, “Drink, and I’ll draw water for your camels too,” let her be the one the Lord has chosen for my master’s son.’
01024045 “Before I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’
01024046 “She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I’ll water your camels too.’ So I drank, and she watered the camels also.
01024047 “I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ “She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milkah bore to him.’ “Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms,
01024048 and I bowed down and worshiped the Lord. I praised the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my master’s brother for his son.
01024049 Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn.”
01024050 Laban and Bethuel answered, “This is from the Lord; we can say nothing to you one way or the other.
01024051 Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master’s son, as the Lord has directed.”
01024052 When Abraham’s servant heard what they said, he bowed down to the ground before the Lord.
01024053 Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother.
01024054 Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there. When they got up the next morning, he said, “Send me on my way to my master.”
01024055 But her brother and her mother replied, “Let the young woman remain with us ten days or so; then you may go.”
01024056 But he said to them, “Do not detain me, now that the Lord has granted success to my journey. Send me on my way so I may go to my master.”
01024057 Then they said, “Let’s call the young woman and ask her about it.”
01024058 So they called Rebekah and asked her, “Will you go with this man?” “I will go,” she said.
01024059 So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham’s servant and his men.
01024060 And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, “Our sister, may you increase to thousands upon thousands; may your offspring possess the cities of their enemies.”
01024061 Then Rebekah and her attendants got ready and mounted the camels and went back with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.
01024062 Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was living in the Negev.
01024063 He went out to the field one evening to meditate, and as he looked up, he saw camels approaching.
01024064 Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel
01024065 and asked the servant, “Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?” “He is my master,” the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself.
01024066 Then the servant told Isaac all he had done.
01024067 Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he married Rebekah. So she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.
01025001 Abraham had taken another wife, whose name was Keturah.
01025002 She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah.
01025003 Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan; the descendants of Dedan were the Ashurites, the Letushites and the Leummites.
01025004 The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanok, Abida and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.
01025005 Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.
01025006 But while he was still living, he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east.
01025007 Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years.
01025008 Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man and full of years; and he was gathered to his people.
01025009 His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite,
01025010 the field Abraham had bought from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah.
01025011 After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who then lived near Beer Lahai Roi.
01025012 This is the account of the family line of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Sarah’s slave, Hagar the Egyptian, bore to Abraham.
01025013 These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, listed in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
01025014 Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
01025015 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah.
01025016 These were the sons of Ishmael, and these are the names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements and camps.
01025017 Ishmael lived a hundred and thirty-seven years. He breathed his last and died, and he was gathered to his people.
01025018 His descendants settled in the area from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt, as you go toward Ashur. And they lived in hostility toward all the tribes related to them.
01025019 This is the account of the family line of Abraham’s son Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac,
01025020 and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram and sister of Laban the Aramean.
01025021 Isaac prayed to the Lord on behalf of his wife, because she was childless. The Lord answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant.
01025022 The babies jostled each other within her, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So she went to inquire of the Lord.
01025023 The Lord said to her, “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.”
01025024 When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.
01025025 The first to come out was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so they named him Esau.
01025026 After this, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them.
01025027 The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was content to stay at home among the tents.
01025028 Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
01025029 Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished.
01025030 He said to Jacob, “Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I’m famished!” (That is why he was also called Edom. )
01025031 Jacob replied, “First sell me your birthright.”
01025032 “Look, I am about to die,” Esau said. “What good is the birthright to me?”
01025033 But Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob.
01025034 Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright.
01026001 Now there was a famine in the land—besides the previous famine in Abraham’s time—and Isaac went to Abimelek king of the Philistines in Gerar.
01026002 The Lord appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land where I tell you to live.
01026003 Stay in this land for a while, and I will be with you and will bless you. For to you and your descendants I will give all these lands and will confirm the oath I swore to your father Abraham.
01026004 I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and will give them all these lands, and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed,
01026005 because Abraham obeyed me and did everything I required of him, keeping my commands, my decrees and my instructions.”
01026006 So Isaac stayed in Gerar.
01026007 When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he said, “She is my sister,” because he was afraid to say, “She is my wife.” He thought, “The men of this place might kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is beautiful.”
01026008 When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelek king of the Philistines looked down from a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.
01026009 So Abimelek summoned Isaac and said, “She is really your wife! Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac answered him, “Because I thought I might lose my life on account of her.”
01026010 Then Abimelek said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the men might well have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.”
01026011 So Abimelek gave orders to all the people: “Anyone who harms this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.”
01026012 Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold, because the Lord blessed him.
01026013 The man became rich, and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy.
01026014 He had so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him.
01026015 So all the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham, the Philistines stopped up, filling them with earth.
01026016 Then Abimelek said to Isaac, “Move away from us; you have become too powerful for us.”
01026017 So Isaac moved away from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar, where he settled.
01026018 Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his father had given them.
01026019 Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there.
01026020 But the herders of Gerar quarreled with those of Isaac and said, “The water is ours!” So he named the well Esek, because they disputed with him.
01026021 Then they dug another well, but they quarreled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah.
01026022 He moved on from there and dug another well, and no one quarreled over it. He named it Rehoboth, saying, “Now the Lord has given us room and we will flourish in the land.”
01026023 From there he went up to Beersheba.
01026024 That night the Lord appeared to him and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bless you and will increase the number of your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham.”
01026025 Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the Lord. There he pitched his tent, and there his servants dug a well.
01026026 Meanwhile, Abimelek had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his personal adviser and Phicol the commander of his forces.
01026027 Isaac asked them, “Why have you come to me, since you were hostile to me and sent me away?”
01026028 They answered, “We saw clearly that the Lord was with you; so we said, ‘There ought to be a sworn agreement between us’—between us and you. Let us make a treaty with you
01026029 that you will do us no harm, just as we did not harm you but always treated you well and sent you away peacefully. And now you are blessed by the Lord.”
01026030 Isaac then made a feast for them, and they ate and drank.
01026031 Early the next morning the men swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they went away peacefully.
01026032 That day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug. They said, “We’ve found water!”
01026033 He called it Shibah, and to this day the name of the town has been Beersheba.
01026034 When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and also Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite.
01026035 They were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah.
01027001 When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called for Esau his older son and said to him, “My son.” “Here I am,” he answered.
01027002 Isaac said, “I am now an old man and don’t know the day of my death.
01027003 Now then, get your equipment—your quiver and bow—and go out to the open country to hunt some wild game for me.
01027004 Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my blessing before I die.”
01027005 Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back,
01027006 Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Look, I overheard your father say to your brother Esau,
01027007 ‘Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat, so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the Lord before I die.’
01027008 Now, my son, listen carefully and do what I tell you:
01027009 Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so I can prepare some tasty food for your father, just the way he likes it.
01027010 Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may give you his blessing before he dies.”
01027011 Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “But my brother Esau is a hairy man while I have smooth skin.
01027012 What if my father touches me? I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing.”
01027013 His mother said to him, “My son, let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me.”
01027014 So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it.
01027015 Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob.
01027016 She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins.
01027017 Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made.
01027018 He went to his father and said, “My father.” “Yes, my son,” he answered. “Who is it?”
01027019 Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.”
01027020 Isaac asked his son, “How did you find it so quickly, my son?” “The Lord your God gave me success,” he replied.
01027021 Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come near so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not.”
01027022 Jacob went close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”
01027023 He did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he proceeded to bless him.
01027024 “Are you really my son Esau?” he asked. “I am,” he replied.
01027025 Then he said, “My son, bring me some of your game to eat, so that I may give you my blessing.” Jacob brought it to him and he ate; and he brought some wine and he drank.
01027026 Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come here, my son, and kiss me.”
01027027 So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said, “Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the Lord has blessed.
01027028 May God give you heaven’s dew and earth’s richness— an abundance of grain and new wine.
01027029 May nations serve you and peoples bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed and those who bless you be blessed.”
01027030 After Isaac finished blessing him, and Jacob had scarcely left his father’s presence, his brother Esau came in from hunting.
01027031 He too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Then he said to him, “My father, please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.”
01027032 His father Isaac asked him, “Who are you?” “I am your son,” he answered, “your firstborn, Esau.”
01027033 Isaac trembled violently and said, “Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him—and indeed he will be blessed!”
01027034 When Esau heard his father’s words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me—me too, my father!”
01027035 But he said, “Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.”
01027036 Esau said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob ? This is the second time he has taken advantage of me: He took my birthright, and now he’s taken my blessing!” Then he asked, “Haven’t you reserved any blessing for me?”
01027037 Isaac answered Esau, “I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?”
01027038 Esau said to his father, “Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!” Then Esau wept aloud.
01027039 His father Isaac answered him, “Your dwelling will be away from the earth’s richness, away from the dew of heaven above.
01027040 You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke from off your neck.”
01027041 Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, “The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob.”
01027042 When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, “Your brother Esau is planning to avenge himself by killing you.
01027043 Now then, my son, do what I say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Harran.
01027044 Stay with him for a while until your brother’s fury subsides.
01027045 When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I’ll send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?”
01027046 Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I’m disgusted with living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land, from Hittite women like these, my life will not be worth living.”
01028001 So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him. Then he commanded him: “Do not marry a Canaanite woman.
01028002 Go at once to Paddan Aram, to the house of your mother’s father Bethuel. Take a wife for yourself there, from among the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother.
01028003 May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and increase your numbers until you become a community of peoples.
01028004 May he give you and your descendants the blessing given to Abraham, so that you may take possession of the land where you now reside as a foreigner, the land God gave to Abraham.”
01028005 Then Isaac sent Jacob on his way, and he went to Paddan Aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, who was the mother of Jacob and Esau.
01028006 Now Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him to Paddan Aram to take a wife from there, and that when he blessed him he commanded him, “Do not marry a Canaanite woman,”
01028007 and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to Paddan Aram.
01028008 Esau then realized how displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father Isaac;
01028009 so he went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, in addition to the wives he already had.
01028010 Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Harran.
01028011 When he reached a certain place, he stopped for the night because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones there, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep.
01028012 He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth, with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.
01028013 There above it stood the Lord, and he said: “I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying.
01028014 Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.
01028015 I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”
01028016 When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought, “Surely the Lord is in this place, and I was not aware of it.”
01028017 He was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven.”
01028018 Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he had placed under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it.
01028019 He called that place Bethel, though the city used to be called Luz.
01028020 Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and will watch over me on this journey I am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear
01028021 so that I return safely to my father’s household, then the Lord will be my God
01028022 and this stone that I have set up as a pillar will be God’s house, and of all that you give me I will give you a tenth.”
01029001 Then Jacob continued on his journey and came to the land of the eastern peoples.
01029002 There he saw a well in the open country, with three flocks of sheep lying near it because the flocks were watered from that well. The stone over the mouth of the well was large.
01029003 When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone away from the well’s mouth and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well.
01029004 Jacob asked the shepherds, “My brothers, where are you from?” “We’re from Harran,” they replied.
01029005 He said to them, “Do you know Laban, Nahor’s grandson?” “Yes, we know him,” they answered.
01029006 Then Jacob asked them, “Is he well?” “Yes, he is,” they said, “and here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.”
01029007 “Look,” he said, “the sun is still high; it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture.”
01029008 “We can’t,” they replied, “until all the flocks are gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.”
01029009 While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherd.
01029010 When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of his uncle Laban, and Laban’s sheep, he went over and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle’s sheep.
01029011 Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud.
01029012 He had told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. So she ran and told her father.
01029013 As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister’s son, he hurried to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home, and there Jacob told him all these things.
01029014 Then Laban said to him, “You are my own flesh and blood.” After Jacob had stayed with him for a whole month,
01029015 Laban said to him, “Just because you are a relative of mine, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.”
01029016 Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
01029017 Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel had a lovely figure and was beautiful.
01029018 Jacob was in love with Rachel and said, “I’ll work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel.”
01029019 Laban said, “It’s better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay here with me.”
01029020 So Jacob served seven years to get Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.
01029021 Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife. My time is completed, and I want to make love to her.”
01029022 So Laban brought together all the people of the place and gave a feast.
01029023 But when evening came, he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob made love to her.
01029024 And Laban gave his servant Zilpah to his daughter as her attendant.
01029025 When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? I served you for Rachel, didn’t I? Why have you deceived me?”
01029026 Laban replied, “It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one.
01029027 Finish this daughter’s bridal week; then we will give you the younger one also, in return for another seven years of work.”
01029028 And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.
01029029 Laban gave his servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her attendant.
01029030 Jacob made love to Rachel also, and his love for Rachel was greater than his love for Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years.
01029031 When the Lord saw that Leah was not loved, he enabled her to conceive, but Rachel remained childless.
01029032 Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, “It is because the Lord has seen my misery. Surely my husband will love me now.”
01029033 She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “Because the Lord heard that I am not loved, he gave me this one too.” So she named him Simeon.
01029034 Again she conceived, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “Now at last my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” So he was named Levi.
01029035 She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “This time I will praise the Lord.” So she named him Judah. Then she stopped having children.
01030001 When Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob any children, she became jealous of her sister. So she said to Jacob, “Give me children, or I’ll die!”
01030002 Jacob became angry with her and said, “Am I in the place of God, who has kept you from having children?”
01030003 Then she said, “Here is Bilhah, my servant. Sleep with her so that she can bear children for me and I too can build a family through her.”
01030004 So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife. Jacob slept with her,
01030005 and she became pregnant and bore him a son.
01030006 Then Rachel said, “God has vindicated me; he has listened to my plea and given me a son.” Because of this she named him Dan.
01030007 Rachel’s servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
01030008 Then Rachel said, “I have had a great struggle with my sister, and I have won.” So she named him Naphtali.
01030009 When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
01030010 Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
01030011 Then Leah said, “What good fortune!” So she named him Gad.
01030012 Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.
01030013 Then Leah said, “How happy I am! The women will call me happy.” So she named him Asher.
01030014 During wheat harvest, Reuben went out into the fields and found some mandrake plants, which he brought to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”
01030015 But she said to her, “Wasn’t it enough that you took away my husband? Will you take my son’s mandrakes too?” “Very well,” Rachel said, “he can sleep with you tonight in return for your son’s mandrakes.”
01030016 So when Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him. “You must sleep with me,” she said. “I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he slept with her that night.
01030017 God listened to Leah, and she became pregnant and bore Jacob a fifth son.
01030018 Then Leah said, “God has rewarded me for giving my servant to my husband.” So she named him Issachar.
01030019 Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son.
01030020 Then Leah said, “God has presented me with a precious gift. This time my husband will treat me with honor, because I have borne him six sons.” So she named him Zebulun.
01030021 Some time later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.
01030022 Then God remembered Rachel; he listened to her and enabled her to conceive.
01030023 She became pregnant and gave birth to a son and said, “God has taken away my disgrace.”
01030024 She named him Joseph, and said, “May the Lord add to me another son.”
01030025 After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me on my way so I can go back to my own homeland.
01030026 Give me my wives and children, for whom I have served you, and I will be on my way. You know how much work I’ve done for you.”
01030027 But Laban said to him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the Lord has blessed me because of you.”
01030028 He added, “Name your wages, and I will pay them.”
01030029 Jacob said to him, “You know how I have worked for you and how your livestock has fared under my care.
01030030 The little you had before I came has increased greatly, and the Lord has blessed you wherever I have been. But now, when may I do something for my own household?”
01030031 “What shall I give you?” he asked. “Don’t give me anything,” Jacob replied. “But if you will do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them:
01030032 Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb and every spotted or speckled goat. They will be my wages.
01030033 And my honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted, or any lamb that is not dark-colored, will be considered stolen.”
01030034 “Agreed,” said Laban. “Let it be as you have said.”
01030035 That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them) and all the dark-colored lambs, and he placed them in the care of his sons.
01030036 Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban’s flocks.
01030037 Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches.
01030038 Then he placed the peeled branches in all the watering troughs, so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the flocks were in heat and came to drink,
01030039 they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted.
01030040 Jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves, but made the rest face the streaked and dark-colored animals that belonged to Laban. Thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Laban’s animals.
01030041 Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches,
01030042 but if the animals were weak, he would not place them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob.
01030043 In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, and female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
01031001 Jacob heard that Laban’s sons were saying, “Jacob has taken everything our father owned and has gained all this wealth from what belonged to our father.”
01031002 And Jacob noticed that Laban’s attitude toward him was not what it had been.
01031003 Then the Lord said to Jacob, “Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you.”
01031004 So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to come out to the fields where his flocks were.
01031005 He said to them, “I see that your father’s attitude toward me is not what it was before, but the God of my father has been with me.
01031006 You know that I’ve worked for your father with all my strength,
01031007 yet your father has cheated me by changing my wages ten times. However, God has not allowed him to harm me.
01031008 If he said, ‘The speckled ones will be your wages,’ then all the flocks gave birth to speckled young; and if he said, ‘The streaked ones will be your wages,’ then all the flocks bore streaked young.
01031009 So God has taken away your father’s livestock and has given them to me.
01031010 “In breeding season I once had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled or spotted.
01031011 The angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob.’ I answered, ‘Here I am.’
01031012 And he said, ‘Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled or spotted, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.
01031013 I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land.’ ”
01031014 Then Rachel and Leah replied, “Do we still have any share in the inheritance of our father’s estate?
01031015 Does he not regard us as foreigners? Not only has he sold us, but he has used up what was paid for us.
01031016 Surely all the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and our children. So do whatever God has told you.”
01031017 Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels,
01031018 and he drove all his livestock ahead of him, along with all the goods he had accumulated in Paddan Aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.
01031019 When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father’s household gods.
01031020 Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was running away.
01031021 So he fled with all he had, crossed the Euphrates River, and headed for the hill country of Gilead.
01031022 On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled.
01031023 Taking his relatives with him, he pursued Jacob for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.
01031024 Then God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, “Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.”
01031025 Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his relatives camped there too.
01031026 Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done? You’ve deceived me, and you’ve carried off my daughters like captives in war.
01031027 Why did you run off secretly and deceive me? Why didn’t you tell me, so I could send you away with joy and singing to the music of timbrels and harps?
01031028 You didn’t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye. You have done a foolish thing.
01031029 I have the power to harm you; but last night the God of your father said to me, ‘Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.’
01031030 Now you have gone off because you longed to return to your father’s household. But why did you steal my gods?”
01031031 Jacob answered Laban, “I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force.
01031032 But if you find anyone who has your gods, that person shall not live. In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me; and if so, take it.” Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods.
01031033 So Laban went into Jacob’s tent and into Leah’s tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he found nothing. After he came out of Leah’s tent, he entered Rachel’s tent.
01031034 Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camel’s saddle and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing.
01031035 Rachel said to her father, “Don’t be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I’m having my period.” So he searched but could not find the household gods.
01031036 Jacob was angry and took Laban to task. “What is my crime?” he asked Laban. “How have I wronged you that you hunt me down?
01031037 Now that you have searched through all my goods, what have you found that belongs to your household? Put it here in front of your relatives and mine, and let them judge between the two of us.
01031038 “I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks.
01031039 I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night.
01031040 This was my situation: The heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night, and sleep fled from my eyes.
01031041 It was like this for the twenty years I was in your household. I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, and you changed my wages ten times.
01031042 If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would surely have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked you.”
01031043 Laban answered Jacob, “The women are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. All you see is mine. Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about the children they have borne?
01031044 Come now, let’s make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between us.”
01031045 So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
01031046 He said to his relatives, “Gather some stones.” So they took stones and piled them in a heap, and they ate there by the heap.
01031047 Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed.
01031048 Laban said, “This heap is a witness between you and me today.” That is why it was called Galeed.
01031049 It was also called Mizpah, because he said, “May the Lord keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other.
01031050 If you mistreat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters, even though no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me.”
01031051 Laban also said to Jacob, “Here is this heap, and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me.
01031052 This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me.
01031053 May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” So Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac.
01031054 He offered a sacrifice there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night there.
01031055 Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then he left and returned home.
01032001 Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
01032002 When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God!” So he named that place Mahanaim.
01032003 Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
01032004 He instructed them: “This is what you are to say to my lord Esau: ‘Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now.
01032005 I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, male and female servants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.’ ”
01032006 When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.”
01032007 In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups, and the flocks and herds and camels as well.
01032008 He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one group, the group that is left may escape.”
01032009 Then Jacob prayed, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, Lord, you who said to me, ‘Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,’
01032010 I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two camps.
01032011 Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children.
01032012 But you have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.’ ”
01032013 He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau:
01032014 two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
01032015 thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
01032016 He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds.”
01032017 He instructed the one in the lead: “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘Who do you belong to, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?’
01032018 then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.’ ”
01032019 He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: “You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.
01032020 And be sure to say, ‘Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.’ ” For he thought, “I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me.”
01032021 So Jacob’s gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.
01032022 That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female servants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
01032023 After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions.
01032024 So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak.
01032025 When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.
01032026 Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.” But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”
01032027 The man asked him, “What is your name?” “Jacob,” he answered.
01032028 Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.”
01032029 Jacob said, “Please tell me your name.” But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed him there.
01032030 So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, “It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.”
01032031 The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip.
01032032 Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob’s hip was touched near the tendon.
01033001 Jacob looked up and there was Esau, coming with his four hundred men; so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two female servants.
01033002 He put the female servants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear.
01033003 He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.
01033004 But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept.
01033005 Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. “Who are these with you?” he asked. Jacob answered, “They are the children God has graciously given your servant.”
01033006 Then the female servants and their children approached and bowed down.
01033007 Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down.
01033008 Esau asked, “What’s the meaning of all these flocks and herds I met?” “To find favor in your eyes, my lord,” he said.
01033009 But Esau said, “I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself.”
01033010 “No, please!” said Jacob. “If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably.
01033011 Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.” And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it.
01033012 Then Esau said, “Let us be on our way; I’ll accompany you.”
01033013 But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die.
01033014 So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the flocks and herds before me and the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.”
01033015 Esau said, “Then let me leave some of my men with you.” “But why do that?” Jacob asked. “Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.”
01033016 So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir.
01033017 Jacob, however, went to Sukkoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Sukkoth.
01033018 After Jacob came from Paddan Aram, he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city.
01033019 For a hundred pieces of silver, he bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his tent.
01033020 There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel.
01034001 Now Dinah, the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women of the land.
01034002 When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of that area, saw her, he took her and raped her.
01034003 His heart was drawn to Dinah daughter of Jacob; he loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her.
01034004 And Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Get me this girl as my wife.”
01034005 When Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been defiled, his sons were in the fields with his livestock; so he did nothing about it until they came home.
01034006 Then Shechem’s father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob.
01034007 Meanwhile, Jacob’s sons had come in from the fields as soon as they heard what had happened. They were shocked and furious, because Shechem had done an outrageous thing in Israel by sleeping with Jacob’s daughter—a thing that should not be done.
01034008 But Hamor said to them, “My son Shechem has his heart set on your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife.
01034009 Intermarry with us; give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves.
01034010 You can settle among us; the land is open to you. Live in it, trade in it, and acquire property in it.”
01034011 Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and I will give you whatever you ask.
01034012 Make the price for the bride and the gift I am to bring as great as you like, and I’ll pay whatever you ask me. Only give me the young woman as my wife.”
01034013 Because their sister Dinah had been defiled, Jacob’s sons replied deceitfully as they spoke to Shechem and his father Hamor.
01034014 They said to them, “We can’t do such a thing; we can’t give our sister to a man who is not circumcised. That would be a disgrace to us.
01034015 We will enter into an agreement with you on one condition only: that you become like us by circumcising all your males.
01034016 Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves. We’ll settle among you and become one people with you.
01034017 But if you will not agree to be circumcised, we’ll take our sister and go.”
01034018 Their proposal seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem.
01034019 The young man, who was the most honored of all his father’s family, lost no time in doing what they said, because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter.
01034020 So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city to speak to the men of their city.
01034021 “These men are friendly toward us,” they said. “Let them live in our land and trade in it; the land has plenty of room for them. We can marry their daughters and they can marry ours.
01034022 But the men will agree to live with us as one people only on the condition that our males be circumcised, as they themselves are.
01034023 Won’t their livestock, their property and all their other animals become ours? So let us agree to their terms, and they will settle among us.”
01034024 All the men who went out of the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male in the city was circumcised.
01034025 Three days later, while all of them were still in pain, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male.
01034026 They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword and took Dinah from Shechem’s house and left.
01034027 The sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city where their sister had been defiled.
01034028 They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields.
01034029 They carried off all their wealth and all their women and children, taking as plunder everything in the houses.
01034030 Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me by making me obnoxious to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people living in this land. We are few in number, and if they join forces against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed.”
01034031 But they replied, “Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?”
01035001 Then God said to Jacob, “Go up to Bethel and settle there, and build an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau.”
01035002 So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods you have with you, and purify yourselves and change your clothes.
01035003 Then come, let us go up to Bethel, where I will build an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone.”
01035004 So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the oak at Shechem.
01035005 Then they set out, and the terror of God fell on the towns all around them so that no one pursued them.
01035006 Jacob and all the people with him came to Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan.
01035007 There he built an altar, and he called the place El Bethel, because it was there that God revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother.
01035008 Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried under the oak outside Bethel. So it was named Allon Bakuth.
01035009 After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram, God appeared to him again and blessed him.
01035010 God said to him, “Your name is Jacob, but you will no longer be called Jacob; your name will be Israel. ” So he named him Israel.
01035011 And God said to him, “I am God Almighty ; be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will be among your descendants.
01035012 The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I also give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you.”
01035013 Then God went up from him at the place where he had talked with him.
01035014 Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had talked with him, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it.
01035015 Jacob called the place where God had talked with him Bethel.
01035016 Then they moved on from Bethel. While they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and had great difficulty.
01035017 And as she was having great difficulty in childbirth, the midwife said to her, “Don’t despair, for you have another son.”
01035018 As she breathed her last—for she was dying—she named her son Ben-Oni. But his father named him Benjamin.
01035019 So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).
01035020 Over her tomb Jacob set up a pillar, and to this day that pillar marks Rachel’s tomb.
01035021 Israel moved on again and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder.
01035022 While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard of it. Jacob had twelve sons:
01035023 The sons of Leah: Reuben the firstborn of Jacob, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zebulun.
01035024 The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
01035025 The sons of Rachel’s servant Bilhah: Dan and Naphtali.
01035026 The sons of Leah’s servant Zilpah: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram.
01035027 Jacob came home to his father Isaac in Mamre, near Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed.
01035028 Isaac lived a hundred and eighty years.
01035029 Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, old and full of years. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
01036001 This is the account of the family line of Esau (that is, Edom).
01036002 Esau took his wives from the women of Canaan: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite—
01036003 also Basemath daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth.
01036004 Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath bore Reuel,
01036005 and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These were the sons of Esau, who were born to him in Canaan.
01036006 Esau took his wives and sons and daughters and all the members of his household, as well as his livestock and all his other animals and all the goods he had acquired in Canaan, and moved to a land some distance from his brother Jacob.
01036007 Their possessions were too great for them to remain together; the land where they were staying could not support them both because of their livestock.
01036008 So Esau (that is, Edom) settled in the hill country of Seir.
01036009 This is the account of the family line of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir.
01036010 These are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz, the son of Esau’s wife Adah, and Reuel, the son of Esau’s wife Basemath.
01036011 The sons of Eliphaz: Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam and Kenaz.
01036012 Esau’s son Eliphaz also had a concubine named Timna, who bore him Amalek. These were grandsons of Esau’s wife Adah.
01036013 The sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were grandsons of Esau’s wife Basemath.
01036014 The sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon, whom she bore to Esau: Jeush, Jalam and Korah.
01036015 These were the chiefs among Esau’s descendants: The sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: Chiefs Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz,
01036016 Korah, Gatam and Amalek. These were the chiefs descended from Eliphaz in Edom; they were grandsons of Adah.
01036017 The sons of Esau’s son Reuel: Chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were the chiefs descended from Reuel in Edom; they were grandsons of Esau’s wife Basemath.
01036018 The sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah: Chiefs Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These were the chiefs descended from Esau’s wife Oholibamah daughter of Anah.
01036019 These were the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these were their chiefs.
01036020 These were the sons of Seir the Horite, who were living in the region: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
01036021 Dishon, Ezer and Dishan. These sons of Seir in Edom were Horite chiefs.
01036022 The sons of Lotan: Hori and Homam. Timna was Lotan’s sister.
01036023 The sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho and Onam.
01036024 The sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is the Anah who discovered the hot springs in the desert while he was grazing the donkeys of his father Zibeon.
01036025 The children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah daughter of Anah.
01036026 The sons of Dishon : Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran and Keran.
01036027 The sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan and Akan.
01036028 The sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
01036029 These were the Horite chiefs: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
01036030 Dishon, Ezer and Dishan. These were the Horite chiefs, according to their divisions, in the land of Seir.
01036031 These were the kings who reigned in Edom before any Israelite king reigned:
01036032 Bela son of Beor became king of Edom. His city was named Dinhabah.
01036033 When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah succeeded him as king.
01036034 When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites succeeded him as king.
01036035 When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the country of Moab, succeeded him as king. His city was named Avith.
01036036 When Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah succeeded him as king.
01036037 When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth on the river succeeded him as king.
01036038 When Shaul died, Baal-Hanan son of Akbor succeeded him as king.
01036039 When Baal-Hanan son of Akbor died, Hadad succeeded him as king. His city was named Pau, and his wife’s name was Mehetabel daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-Zahab.
01036040 These were the chiefs descended from Esau, by name, according to their clans and regions: Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,
01036041 Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,
01036042 Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,
01036043 Magdiel and Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom, according to their settlements in the land they occupied. This is the family line of Esau, the father of the Edomites.
01037001 Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan.
01037002 This is the account of Jacob’s family line. Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them.
01037003 Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age; and he made an ornate robe for him.
01037004 When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him.
01037005 Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more.
01037006 He said to them, “Listen to this dream I had:
01037007 We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.”
01037008 His brothers said to him, “Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?” And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said.
01037009 Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. “Listen,” he said, “I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”
01037010 When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, “What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?”
01037011 His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.
01037012 Now his brothers had gone to graze their father’s flocks near Shechem,
01037013 and Israel said to Joseph, “As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them.” “Very well,” he replied.
01037014 So he said to him, “Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me.” Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. When Joseph arrived at Shechem,
01037015 a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, “What are you looking for?”
01037016 He replied, “I’m looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?”
01037017 “They have moved on from here,” the man answered. “I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.’ ” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan.
01037018 But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.
01037019 “Here comes that dreamer!” they said to each other.
01037020 “Come now, let’s kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we’ll see what comes of his dreams.”
01037021 When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. “Let’s not take his life,” he said.
01037022 “Don’t shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the wilderness, but don’t lay a hand on him.” Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father.
01037023 So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe—the ornate robe he was wearing—
01037024 and they took him and threw him into the cistern. The cistern was empty; there was no water in it.
01037025 As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt.
01037026 Judah said to his brothers, “What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?
01037027 Come, let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.” His brothers agreed.
01037028 So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt.
01037029 When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes.
01037030 He went back to his brothers and said, “The boy isn’t there! Where can I turn now?”
01037031 Then they got Joseph’s robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.
01037032 They took the ornate robe back to their father and said, “We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son’s robe.”
01037033 He recognized it and said, “It is my son’s robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.”
01037034 Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days.
01037035 All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. “No,” he said, “I will continue to mourn until I join my son in the grave.” So his father wept for him.
01037036 Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh’s officials, the captain of the guard.
01038001 At that time, Judah left his brothers and went down to stay with a man of Adullam named Hirah.
01038002 There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua. He married her and made love to her;
01038003 she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, who was named Er.
01038004 She conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him Onan.
01038005 She gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah. It was at Kezib that she gave birth to him.
01038006 Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.
01038007 But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the Lord’s sight; so the Lord put him to death.
01038008 Then Judah said to Onan, “Sleep with your brother’s wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to raise up offspring for your brother.”
01038009 But Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever he slept with his brother’s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from providing offspring for his brother.
01038010 What he did was wicked in the Lord’s sight; so the Lord put him to death also.
01038011 Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Live as a widow in your father’s household until my son Shelah grows up.” For he thought, “He may die too, just like his brothers.” So Tamar went to live in her father’s household.
01038012 After a long time Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When Judah had recovered from his grief, he went up to Timnah, to the men who were shearing his sheep, and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went with him.
01038013 When Tamar was told, “Your father-in-law is on his way to Timnah to shear his sheep,”
01038014 she took off her widow’s clothes, covered herself with a veil to disguise herself, and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that, though Shelah had now grown up, she had not been given to him as his wife.
01038015 When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.
01038016 Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, “Come now, let me sleep with you.” “And what will you give me to sleep with you?” she asked.
01038017 “I’ll send you a young goat from my flock,” he said. “Will you give me something as a pledge until you send it?” she asked.
01038018 He said, “What pledge should I give you?” “Your seal and its cord, and the staff in your hand,” she answered. So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him.
01038019 After she left, she took off her veil and put on her widow’s clothes again.
01038020 Meanwhile Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite in order to get his pledge back from the woman, but he did not find her.
01038021 He asked the men who lived there, “Where is the shrine prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?” “There hasn’t been any shrine prostitute here,” they said.
01038022 So he went back to Judah and said, “I didn’t find her. Besides, the men who lived there said, ‘There hasn’t been any shrine prostitute here.’ ”
01038023 Then Judah said, “Let her keep what she has, or we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her this young goat, but you didn’t find her.”
01038024 About three months later Judah was told, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution, and as a result she is now pregnant.” Judah said, “Bring her out and have her burned to death!”
01038025 As she was being brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law. “I am pregnant by the man who owns these,” she said. And she added, “See if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are.”
01038026 Judah recognized them and said, “She is more righteous than I, since I wouldn’t give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not sleep with her again.
01038027 When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.
01038028 As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said, “This one came out first.”
01038029 But when he drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she said, “So this is how you have broken out!” And he was named Perez.
01038030 Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist, came out. And he was named Zerah.
01039001 Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. Potiphar, an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh’s officials, the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.
01039002 The Lord was with Joseph so that he prospered, and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master.
01039003 When his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord gave him success in everything he did,
01039004 Joseph found favor in his eyes and became his attendant. Potiphar put him in charge of his household, and he entrusted to his care everything he owned.
01039005 From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the Lord blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph. The blessing of the Lord was on everything Potiphar had, both in the house and in the field.
01039006 So Potiphar left everything he had in Joseph’s care; with Joseph in charge, he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was well-built and handsome,
01039007 and after a while his master’s wife took notice of Joseph and said, “Come to bed with me!”
01039008 But he refused. “With me in charge,” he told her, “my master does not concern himself with anything in the house; everything he owns he has entrusted to my care.
01039009 No one is greater in this house than I am. My master has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?”
01039010 And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her.
01039011 One day he went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the household servants was inside.
01039012 She caught him by his cloak and said, “Come to bed with me!” But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house.
01039013 When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house,
01039014 she called her household servants. “Look,” she said to them, “this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us! He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed.
01039015 When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.”
01039016 She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home.
01039017 Then she told him this story: “That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me.
01039018 But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.”
01039019 When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, “This is how your slave treated me,” he burned with anger.
01039020 Joseph’s master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined. But while Joseph was there in the prison,
01039021 the Lord was with him; he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.
01039022 So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there.
01039023 The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph’s care, because the Lord was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did.
01040001 Some time later, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their master, the king of Egypt.
01040002 Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,
01040003 and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined.
01040004 The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he attended them. After they had been in custody for some time,
01040005 each of the two men—the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were being held in prison—had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.
01040006 When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw that they were dejected.
01040007 So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who were in custody with him in his master’s house, “Why do you look so sad today?”
01040008 “We both had dreams,” they answered, “but there is no one to interpret them.” Then Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams.”
01040009 So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said to him, “In my dream I saw a vine in front of me,
01040010 and on the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes.
01040011 Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup and put the cup in his hand.”
01040012 “This is what it means,” Joseph said to him. “The three branches are three days.
01040013 Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.
01040014 But when all goes well with you, remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison.
01040015 I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon.”
01040016 When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation, he said to Joseph, “I too had a dream: On my head were three baskets of bread.
01040017 In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”
01040018 “This is what it means,” Joseph said. “The three baskets are three days.
01040019 Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and impale your body on a pole. And the birds will eat away your flesh.”
01040020 Now the third day was Pharaoh’s birthday, and he gave a feast for all his officials. He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his officials:
01040021 He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand—
01040022 but he impaled the chief baker, just as Joseph had said to them in his interpretation.
01040023 The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot him.
01041001 When two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing by the Nile,
01041002 when out of the river there came up seven cows, sleek and fat, and they grazed among the reeds.
01041003 After them, seven other cows, ugly and gaunt, came up out of the Nile and stood beside those on the riverbank.
01041004 And the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.
01041005 He fell asleep again and had a second dream: Seven heads of grain, healthy and good, were growing on a single stalk.
01041006 After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted—thin and scorched by the east wind.
01041007 The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up; it had been a dream.
01041008 In the morning his mind was troubled, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him.
01041009 Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “Today I am reminded of my shortcomings.
01041010 Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.
01041011 Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.
01041012 Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream.
01041013 And things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the other man was impaled.”
01041014 So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh.
01041015 Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”
01041016 “I cannot do it,” Joseph replied to Pharaoh, “but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires.”
01041017 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile,
01041018 when out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they grazed among the reeds.
01041019 After them, seven other cows came up—scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt.
01041020 The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first.
01041021 But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up.
01041022 “In my dream I saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk.
01041023 After them, seven other heads sprouted—withered and thin and scorched by the east wind.
01041024 The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none of them could explain it to me.”
01041025 Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
01041026 The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years; it is one and the same dream.
01041027 The seven lean, ugly cows that came up afterward are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind: They are seven years of famine.
01041028 “It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.
01041029 Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt,
01041030 but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will ravage the land.
01041031 The abundance in the land will not be remembered, because the famine that follows it will be so severe.
01041032 The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God, and God will do it soon.
01041033 “And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt.
01041034 Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.
01041035 They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities for food.
01041036 This food should be held in reserve for the country, to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt, so that the country may not be ruined by the famine.”
01041037 The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his officials.
01041038 So Pharaoh asked them, “Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God ?”
01041039 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one so discerning and wise as you.
01041040 You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you.”
01041041 So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt.”
01041042 Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Joseph’s finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck.
01041043 He had him ride in a chariot as his second-in-command, and people shouted before him, “Make way !” Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt.
01041044 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, but without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt.”
01041045 Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife. And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt.
01041046 Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh’s presence and traveled throughout Egypt.
01041047 During the seven years of abundance the land produced plentifully.
01041048 Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the cities. In each city he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it.
01041049 Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea; it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure.
01041050 Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.
01041051 Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh and said, “It is because God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father’s household.”
01041052 The second son he named Ephraim and said, “It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering.”
01041053 The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end,
01041054 and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all the other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food.
01041055 When all Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.”
01041056 When the famine had spread over the whole country, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout Egypt.
01041057 And all the world came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe everywhere.
01042001 When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why do you just keep looking at each other?”
01042002 He continued, “I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die.”
01042003 Then ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.
01042004 But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with the others, because he was afraid that harm might come to him.
01042005 So Israel’s sons were among those who went to buy grain, for there was famine in the land of Canaan also.
01042006 Now Joseph was the governor of the land, the person who sold grain to all its people. So when Joseph’s brothers arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.
01042007 As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. “Where do you come from?” he asked. “From the land of Canaan,” they replied, “to buy food.”
01042008 Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him.
01042009 Then he remembered his dreams about them and said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see where our land is unprotected.”
01042010 “No, my lord,” they answered. “Your servants have come to buy food.
01042011 We are all the sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies.”
01042012 “No!” he said to them. “You have come to see where our land is unprotected.”
01042013 But they replied, “Your servants were twelve brothers, the sons of one man, who lives in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more.”
01042014 Joseph said to them, “It is just as I told you: You are spies!
01042015 And this is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.
01042016 Send one of your number to get your brother; the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth. If you are not, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!”
01042017 And he put them all in custody for three days.
01042018 On the third day, Joseph said to them, “Do this and you will live, for I fear God:
01042019 If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here in prison, while the rest of you go and take grain back for your starving households.
01042020 But you must bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words may be verified and that you may not die.” This they proceeded to do.
01042021 They said to one another, “Surely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us for his life, but we would not listen; that’s why this distress has come on us.”
01042022 Reuben replied, “Didn’t I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn’t listen! Now we must give an accounting for his blood.”
01042023 They did not realize that Joseph could understand them, since he was using an interpreter.
01042024 He turned away from them and began to weep, but then came back and spoke to them again. He had Simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes.
01042025 Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to put each man’s silver back in his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. After this was done for them,
01042026 they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left.
01042027 At the place where they stopped for the night one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack.
01042028 “My silver has been returned,” he said to his brothers. “Here it is in my sack.” Their hearts sank and they turned to each other trembling and said, “What is this that God has done to us?”
01042029 When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them. They said,
01042030 “The man who is lord over the land spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying on the land.
01042031 But we said to him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies.
01042032 We were twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in Canaan.’
01042033 “Then the man who is lord over the land said to us, ‘This is how I will know whether you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for your starving households and go.
01042034 But bring your youngest brother to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you can trade in the land.’ ”
01042035 As they were emptying their sacks, there in each man’s sack was his pouch of silver! When they and their father saw the money pouches, they were frightened.
01042036 Their father Jacob said to them, “You have deprived me of my children. Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!”
01042037 Then Reuben said to his father, “You may put both of my sons to death if I do not bring him back to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him back.”
01042038 But Jacob said, “My son will not go down there with you; his brother is dead and he is the only one left. If harm comes to him on the journey you are taking, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in sorrow.”
01043001 Now the famine was still severe in the land.
01043002 So when they had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go back and buy us a little more food.”
01043003 But Judah said to him, “The man warned us solemnly, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’
01043004 If you will send our brother along with us, we will go down and buy food for you.
01043005 But if you will not send him, we will not go down, because the man said to us, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’ ”
01043006 Israel asked, “Why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had another brother?”
01043007 They replied, “The man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family. ‘Is your father still living?’ he asked us. ‘Do you have another brother?’ We simply answered his questions. How were we to know he would say, ‘Bring your brother down here’?”
01043008 Then Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the boy along with me and we will go at once, so that we and you and our children may live and not die.
01043009 I myself will guarantee his safety; you can hold me personally responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him here before you, I will bear the blame before you all my life.
01043010 As it is, if we had not delayed, we could have gone and returned twice.”
01043011 Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be, then do this: Put some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift—a little balm and a little honey, some spices and myrrh, some pistachio nuts and almonds.
01043012 Take double the amount of silver with you, for you must return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake.
01043013 Take your brother also and go back to the man at once.
01043014 And may God Almighty grant you mercy before the man so that he will let your other brother and Benjamin come back with you. As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved.”
01043015 So the men took the gifts and double the amount of silver, and Benjamin also. They hurried down to Egypt and presented themselves to Joseph.
01043016 When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Take these men to my house, slaughter an animal and prepare a meal; they are to eat with me at noon.”
01043017 The man did as Joseph told him and took the men to Joseph’s house.
01043018 Now the men were frightened when they were taken to his house. They thought, “We were brought here because of the silver that was put back into our sacks the first time. He wants to attack us and overpower us and seize us as slaves and take our donkeys.”
01043019 So they went up to Joseph’s steward and spoke to him at the entrance to the house.
01043020 “We beg your pardon, our lord,” they said, “we came down here the first time to buy food.
01043021 But at the place where we stopped for the night we opened our sacks and each of us found his silver—the exact weight—in the mouth of his sack. So we have brought it back with us.
01043022 We have also brought additional silver with us to buy food. We don’t know who put our silver in our sacks.”
01043023 “It’s all right,” he said. “Don’t be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks; I received your silver.” Then he brought Simeon out to them.
01043024 The steward took the men into Joseph’s house, gave them water to wash their feet and provided fodder for their donkeys.
01043025 They prepared their gifts for Joseph’s arrival at noon, because they had heard that they were to eat there.
01043026 When Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts they had brought into the house, and they bowed down before him to the ground.
01043027 He asked them how they were, and then he said, “How is your aged father you told me about? Is he still living?”
01043028 They replied, “Your servant our father is still alive and well.” And they bowed down, prostrating themselves before him.
01043029 As he looked about and saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother’s son, he asked, “Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?” And he said, “God be gracious to you, my son.”
01043030 Deeply moved at the sight of his brother, Joseph hurried out and looked for a place to weep. He went into his private room and wept there.
01043031 After he had washed his face, he came out and, controlling himself, said, “Serve the food.”
01043032 They served him by himself, the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, for that is detestable to Egyptians.
01043033 The men had been seated before him in the order of their ages, from the firstborn to the youngest; and they looked at each other in astonishment.
01043034 When portions were served to them from Joseph’s table, Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as anyone else’s. So they feasted and drank freely with him.
01044001 Now Joseph gave these instructions to the steward of his house: “Fill the men’s sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each man’s silver in the mouth of his sack.
01044002 Then put my cup, the silver one, in the mouth of the youngest one’s sack, along with the silver for his grain.” And he did as Joseph said.
01044003 As morning dawned, the men were sent on their way with their donkeys.
01044004 They had not gone far from the city when Joseph said to his steward, “Go after those men at once, and when you catch up with them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid good with evil?
01044005 Isn’t this the cup my master drinks from and also uses for divination? This is a wicked thing you have done.’ ”
01044006 When he caught up with them, he repeated these words to them.
01044007 But they said to him, “Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do anything like that!
01044008 We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver we found inside the mouths of our sacks. So why would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house?
01044009 If any of your servants is found to have it, he will die; and the rest of us will become my lord’s slaves.”
01044010 “Very well, then,” he said, “let it be as you say. Whoever is found to have it will become my slave; the rest of you will be free from blame.”
01044011 Each of them quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it.
01044012 Then the steward proceeded to search, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
01044013 At this, they tore their clothes. Then they all loaded their donkeys and returned to the city.
01044014 Joseph was still in the house when Judah and his brothers came in, and they threw themselves to the ground before him.
01044015 Joseph said to them, “What is this you have done? Don’t you know that a man like me can find things out by divination?”
01044016 “What can we say to my lord?” Judah replied. “What can we say? How can we prove our innocence? God has uncovered your servants’ guilt. We are now my lord’s slaves—we ourselves and the one who was found to have the cup.”
01044017 But Joseph said, “Far be it from me to do such a thing! Only the man who was found to have the cup will become my slave. The rest of you, go back to your father in peace.”
01044018 Then Judah went up to him and said: “Pardon your servant, my lord, let me speak a word to my lord. Do not be angry with your servant, though you are equal to Pharaoh himself.
01044019 My lord asked his servants, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’
01044020 And we answered, ‘We have an aged father, and there is a young son born to him in his old age. His brother is dead, and he is the only one of his mother’s sons left, and his father loves him.’
01044021 “Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me so I can see him for myself.’
01044022 And we said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father; if he leaves him, his father will die.’
01044023 But you told your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.’
01044024 When we went back to your servant my father, we told him what my lord had said.
01044025 “Then our father said, ‘Go back and buy a little more food.’
01044026 But we said, ‘We cannot go down. Only if our youngest brother is with us will we go. We cannot see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’
01044027 “Your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons.
01044028 One of them went away from me, and I said, “He has surely been torn to pieces.” And I have not seen him since.
01044029 If you take this one from me too and harm comes to him, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in misery.’
01044030 “So now, if the boy is not with us when I go back to your servant my father, and if my father, whose life is closely bound up with the boy’s life,
01044031 sees that the boy isn’t there, he will die. Your servants will bring the gray head of our father down to the grave in sorrow.
01044032 Your servant guaranteed the boy’s safety to my father. I said, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, I will bear the blame before you, my father, all my life!’
01044033 “Now then, please let your servant remain here as my lord’s slave in place of the boy, and let the boy return with his brothers.
01044034 How can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? No! Do not let me see the misery that would come on my father.”
01045001 Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants, and he cried out, “Have everyone leave my presence!” So there was no one with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers.
01045002 And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him, and Pharaoh’s household heard about it.
01045003 Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still living?” But his brothers were not able to answer him, because they were terrified at his presence.
01045004 Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Come close to me.” When they had done so, he said, “I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt!
01045005 And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you.
01045006 For two years now there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years there will be no plowing and reaping.
01045007 But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
01045008 “So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt.
01045009 Now hurry back to my father and say to him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; don’t delay.
01045010 You shall live in the region of Goshen and be near me—you, your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and all you have.
01045011 I will provide for you there, because five years of famine are still to come. Otherwise you and your household and all who belong to you will become destitute.’
01045012 “You can see for yourselves, and so can my brother Benjamin, that it is really I who am speaking to you.
01045013 Tell my father about all the honor accorded me in Egypt and about everything you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly.”
01045014 Then he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin embraced him, weeping.
01045015 And he kissed all his brothers and wept over them. Afterward his brothers talked with him.
01045016 When the news reached Pharaoh’s palace that Joseph’s brothers had come, Pharaoh and all his officials were pleased.
01045017 Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan,
01045018 and bring your father and your families back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you can enjoy the fat of the land.’
01045019 “You are also directed to tell them, ‘Do this: Take some carts from Egypt for your children and your wives, and get your father and come.
01045020 Never mind about your belongings, because the best of all Egypt will be yours.’ ”
01045021 So the sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them carts, as Pharaoh had commanded, and he also gave them provisions for their journey.
01045022 To each of them he gave new clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five sets of clothes.
01045023 And this is what he sent to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other provisions for his journey.
01045024 Then he sent his brothers away, and as they were leaving he said to them, “Don’t quarrel on the way!”
01045025 So they went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.
01045026 They told him, “Joseph is still alive! In fact, he is ruler of all Egypt.” Jacob was stunned; he did not believe them.
01045027 But when they told him everything Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts Joseph had sent to carry him back, the spirit of their father Jacob revived.
01045028 And Israel said, “I’m convinced! My son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”
01046001 So Israel set out with all that was his, and when he reached Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
01046002 And God spoke to Israel in a vision at night and said, “Jacob! Jacob!” “Here I am,” he replied.
01046003 “I am God, the God of your father,” he said. “Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there.
01046004 I will go down to Egypt with you, and I will surely bring you back again. And Joseph’s own hand will close your eyes.”
01046005 Then Jacob left Beersheba, and Israel’s sons took their father Jacob and their children and their wives in the carts that Pharaoh had sent to transport him.
01046006 So Jacob and all his offspring went to Egypt, taking with them their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in Canaan.
01046007 Jacob brought with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons and his daughters and granddaughters—all his offspring.
01046008 These are the names of the sons of Israel (Jacob and his descendants) who went to Egypt: Reuben the firstborn of Jacob.
01046009 The sons of Reuben: Hanok, Pallu, Hezron and Karmi.
01046010 The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.
01046011 The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari.
01046012 The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez and Zerah (but Er and Onan had died in the land of Canaan). The sons of Perez: Hezron and Hamul.
01046013 The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puah, Jashub and Shimron.
01046014 The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon and Jahleel.
01046015 These were the sons Leah bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, besides his daughter Dinah. These sons and daughters of his were thirty-three in all.
01046016 The sons of Gad: Zephon, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi and Areli.
01046017 The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi and Beriah. Their sister was Serah. The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malkiel.
01046018 These were the children born to Jacob by Zilpah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Leah—sixteen in all.
01046019 The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
01046020 In Egypt, Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.
01046021 The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Beker, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim and Ard.
01046022 These were the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob—fourteen in all.
01046023 The son of Dan: Hushim.
01046024 The sons of Naphtali: Jahziel, Guni, Jezer and Shillem.
01046025 These were the sons born to Jacob by Bilhah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Rachel—seven in all.
01046026 All those who went to Egypt with Jacob—those who were his direct descendants, not counting his sons’ wives—numbered sixty-six persons.
01046027 With the two sons who had been born to Joseph in Egypt, the members of Jacob’s family, which went to Egypt, were seventy in all.
01046028 Now Jacob sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to get directions to Goshen. When they arrived in the region of Goshen,
01046029 Joseph had his chariot made ready and went to Goshen to meet his father Israel. As soon as Joseph appeared before him, he threw his arms around his father and wept for a long time.
01046030 Israel said to Joseph, “Now I am ready to die, since I have seen for myself that you are still alive.”
01046031 Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and speak to Pharaoh and will say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household, who were living in the land of Canaan, have come to me.
01046032 The men are shepherds; they tend livestock, and they have brought along their flocks and herds and everything they own.’
01046033 When Pharaoh calls you in and asks, ‘What is your occupation?’
01046034 you should answer, ‘Your servants have tended livestock from our boyhood on, just as our fathers did.’ Then you will be allowed to settle in the region of Goshen, for all shepherds are detestable to the Egyptians.”
01047001 Joseph went and told Pharaoh, “My father and brothers, with their flocks and herds and everything they own, have come from the land of Canaan and are now in Goshen.”
01047002 He chose five of his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh.
01047003 Pharaoh asked the brothers, “What is your occupation?” “Your servants are shepherds,” they replied to Pharaoh, “just as our fathers were.”
01047004 They also said to him, “We have come to live here for a while, because the famine is severe in Canaan and your servants’ flocks have no pasture. So now, please let your servants settle in Goshen.”
01047005 Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you,
01047006 and the land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land. Let them live in Goshen. And if you know of any among them with special ability, put them in charge of my own livestock.”
01047007 Then Joseph brought his father Jacob in and presented him before Pharaoh. After Jacob blessed Pharaoh,
01047008 Pharaoh asked him, “How old are you?”
01047009 And Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty. My years have been few and difficult, and they do not equal the years of the pilgrimage of my fathers.”
01047010 Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from his presence.
01047011 So Joseph settled his father and his brothers in Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land, the district of Rameses, as Pharaoh directed.
01047012 Joseph also provided his father and his brothers and all his father’s household with food, according to the number of their children.
01047013 There was no food, however, in the whole region because the famine was severe; both Egypt and Canaan wasted away because of the famine.
01047014 Joseph collected all the money that was to be found in Egypt and Canaan in payment for the grain they were buying, and he brought it to Pharaoh’s palace.
01047015 When the money of the people of Egypt and Canaan was gone, all Egypt came to Joseph and said, “Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? Our money is all gone.”
01047016 “Then bring your livestock,” said Joseph. “I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock, since your money is gone.”
01047017 So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, their sheep and goats, their cattle and donkeys. And he brought them through that year with food in exchange for all their livestock.
01047018 When that year was over, they came to him the following year and said, “We cannot hide from our lord the fact that since our money is gone and our livestock belongs to you, there is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land.
01047019 Why should we perish before your eyes—we and our land as well? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we with our land will be in bondage to Pharaoh. Give us seed so that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become desolate.”
01047020 So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh. The Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields, because the famine was too severe for them. The land became Pharaoh’s,
01047021 and Joseph reduced the people to servitude, from one end of Egypt to the other.
01047022 However, he did not buy the land of the priests, because they received a regular allotment from Pharaoh and had food enough from the allotment Pharaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land.
01047023 Joseph said to the people, “Now that I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh, here is seed for you so you can plant the ground.
01047024 But when the crop comes in, give a fifth of it to Pharaoh. The other four-fifths you may keep as seed for the fields and as food for yourselves and your households and your children.”
01047025 “You have saved our lives,” they said. “May we find favor in the eyes of our lord; we will be in bondage to Pharaoh.”
01047026 So Joseph established it as a law concerning land in Egypt—still in force today—that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh. It was only the land of the priests that did not become Pharaoh’s.
01047027 Now the Israelites settled in Egypt in the region of Goshen. They acquired property there and were fruitful and increased greatly in number.
01047028 Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years, and the years of his life were a hundred and forty-seven.
01047029 When the time drew near for Israel to die, he called for his son Joseph and said to him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise that you will show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt,
01047030 but when I rest with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried.” “I will do as you say,” he said.
01047031 “Swear to me,” he said. Then Joseph swore to him, and Israel worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff.
01048001 Some time later Joseph was told, “Your father is ill.” So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim along with him.
01048002 When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come to you,” Israel rallied his strength and sat up on the bed.
01048003 Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and there he blessed me
01048004 and said to me, ‘I am going to make you fruitful and increase your numbers. I will make you a community of peoples, and I will give this land as an everlasting possession to your descendants after you.’
01048005 “Now then, your two sons born to you in Egypt before I came to you here will be reckoned as mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.
01048006 Any children born to you after them will be yours; in the territory they inherit they will be reckoned under the names of their brothers.
01048007 As I was returning from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan while we were still on the way, a little distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath” (that is, Bethlehem).
01048008 When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he asked, “Who are these?”
01048009 “They are the sons God has given me here,” Joseph said to his father. Then Israel said, “Bring them to me so I may bless them.”
01048010 Now Israel’s eyes were failing because of old age, and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons close to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them.
01048011 Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see your face again, and now God has allowed me to see your children too.”
01048012 Then Joseph removed them from Israel’s knees and bowed down with his face to the ground.
01048013 And Joseph took both of them, Ephraim on his right toward Israel’s left hand and Manasseh on his left toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them close to him.
01048014 But Israel reached out his right hand and put it on Ephraim’s head, though he was the younger, and crossing his arms, he put his left hand on Manasseh’s head, even though Manasseh was the firstborn.
01048015 Then he blessed Joseph and said, “May the God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked faithfully, the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day,
01048016 the Angel who has delivered me from all harm —may he bless these boys. May they be called by my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may they increase greatly on the earth.”
01048017 When Joseph saw his father placing his right hand on Ephraim’s head he was displeased; so he took hold of his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head.
01048018 Joseph said to him, “No, my father, this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.”
01048019 But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He too will become a people, and he too will become great. Nevertheless, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become a group of nations.”
01048020 He blessed them that day and said, “In your name will Israel pronounce this blessing: ‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’ ” So he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh.
01048021 Then Israel said to Joseph, “I am about to die, but God will be with you and take you back to the land of your fathers.
01048022 And to you I give one more ridge of land than to your brothers, the ridge I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow.”
01049001 Then Jacob called for his sons and said: “Gather around so I can tell you what will happen to you in days to come.
01049002 “Assemble and listen, sons of Jacob; listen to your father Israel.
01049003 “Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, the first sign of my strength, excelling in honor, excelling in power.
01049004 Turbulent as the waters, you will no longer excel, for you went up onto your father’s bed, onto my couch and defiled it.
01049005 “Simeon and Levi are brothers— their swords are weapons of violence.
01049006 Let me not enter their council, let me not join their assembly, for they have killed men in their anger and hamstrung oxen as they pleased.
01049007 Cursed be their anger, so fierce, and their fury, so cruel! I will scatter them in Jacob and disperse them in Israel.
01049008 “Judah, your brothers will praise you; your hand will be on the neck of your enemies; your father’s sons will bow down to you.
01049009 You are a lion’s cub, Judah; you return from the prey, my son. Like a lion he crouches and lies down, like a lioness—who dares to rouse him?
01049010 The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, until he to whom it belongs shall come and the obedience of the nations shall be his.
01049011 He will tether his donkey to a vine, his colt to the choicest branch; he will wash his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes.
01049012 His eyes will be darker than wine, his teeth whiter than milk.
01049013 “Zebulun will live by the seashore and become a haven for ships; his border will extend toward Sidon.
01049014 “Issachar is a rawboned donkey lying down among the sheep pens.
01049015 When he sees how good is his resting place and how pleasant is his land, he will bend his shoulder to the burden and submit to forced labor.
01049016 “Dan will provide justice for his people as one of the tribes of Israel.
01049017 Dan will be a snake by the roadside, a viper along the path, that bites the horse’s heels so that its rider tumbles backward.
01049018 “I look for your deliverance, Lord.
01049019 “Gad will be attacked by a band of raiders, but he will attack them at their heels.
01049020 “Asher’s food will be rich; he will provide delicacies fit for a king.
01049021 “Naphtali is a doe set free that bears beautiful fawns.
01049022 “Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine near a spring, whose branches climb over a wall.
01049023 With bitterness archers attacked him; they shot at him with hostility.
01049024 But his bow remained steady, his strong arms stayed limber, because of the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob, because of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,
01049025 because of your father’s God, who helps you, because of the Almighty, who blesses you with blessings of the skies above, blessings of the deep springs below, blessings of the breast and womb.
01049026 Your father’s blessings are greater than the blessings of the ancient mountains, than the bounty of the age-old hills. Let all these rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among his brothers.
01049027 “Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, in the evening he divides the plunder.”
01049028 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them, giving each the blessing appropriate to him.
01049029 Then he gave them these instructions: “I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
01049030 the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in Canaan, which Abraham bought along with the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite.
01049031 There Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried, there Isaac and his wife Rebekah were buried, and there I buried Leah.
01049032 The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites. ”
01049033 When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, breathed his last and was gathered to his people.
01050001 Joseph threw himself on his father and wept over him and kissed him.
01050002 Then Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel. So the physicians embalmed him,
01050003 taking a full forty days, for that was the time required for embalming. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
01050004 When the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh’s court, “If I have found favor in your eyes, speak to Pharaoh for me. Tell him,
01050005 ‘My father made me swear an oath and said, “I am about to die; bury me in the tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan.” Now let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.’ ”
01050006 Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear to do.”
01050007 So Joseph went up to bury his father. All Pharaoh’s officials accompanied him—the dignitaries of his court and all the dignitaries of Egypt—
01050008 besides all the members of Joseph’s household and his brothers and those belonging to his father’s household. Only their children and their flocks and herds were left in Goshen.
01050009 Chariots and horsemen also went up with him. It was a very large company.
01050010 When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, near the Jordan, they lamented loudly and bitterly; and there Joseph observed a seven-day period of mourning for his father.
01050011 When the Canaanites who lived there saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “The Egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of mourning.” That is why that place near the Jordan is called Abel Mizraim.
01050012 So Jacob’s sons did as he had commanded them:
01050013 They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre, which Abraham had bought along with the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite.
01050014 After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, together with his brothers and all the others who had gone with him to bury his father.
01050015 When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?”
01050016 So they sent word to Joseph, saying, “Your father left these instructions before he died:
01050017 ‘This is what you are to say to Joseph: I ask you to forgive your brothers the sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly.’ Now please forgive the sins of the servants of the God of your father.” When their message came to him, Joseph wept.
01050018 His brothers then came and threw themselves down before him. “We are your slaves,” they said.
01050019 But Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Am I in the place of God?
01050020 You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.
01050021 So then, don’t be afraid. I will provide for you and your children.” And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them.
01050022 Joseph stayed in Egypt, along with all his father’s family. He lived a hundred and ten years
01050023 and saw the third generation of Ephraim’s children. Also the children of Makir son of Manasseh were placed at birth on Joseph’s knees.
01050024 Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.”
01050025 And Joseph made the Israelites swear an oath and said, “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place.”
01050026 So Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten. And after they embalmed him, he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.
02001001 These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:
02001002 Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;
02001003 Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;
02001004 Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.
02001005 The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy in all; Joseph was already in Egypt.
02001006 Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,
02001007 but the Israelites were exceedingly fruitful; they multiplied greatly, increased in numbers and became so numerous that the land was filled with them.
02001008 Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt.
02001009 “Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become far too numerous for us.
02001010 Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.”
02001011 So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.
02001012 But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites
02001013 and worked them ruthlessly.
02001014 They made their lives bitter with harsh labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their harsh labor the Egyptians worked them ruthlessly.
02001015 The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,
02001016 “When you are helping the Hebrew women during childbirth on the delivery stool, if you see that the baby is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live.”
02001017 The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live.
02001018 Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?”
02001019 The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.”
02001020 So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous.
02001021 And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.
02001022 Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Every Hebrew boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.”
02002001 Now a man of the tribe of Levi married a Levite woman,
02002002 and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months.
02002003 But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.
02002004 His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.
02002005 Then Pharaoh’s daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the riverbank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her female slave to get it.
02002006 She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. “This is one of the Hebrew babies,” she said.
02002007 Then his sister asked Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?”
02002008 “Yes, go,” she answered. So the girl went and got the baby’s mother.
02002009 Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.” So the woman took the baby and nursed him.
02002010 When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses, saying, “I drew him out of the water.”
02002011 One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.
02002012 Looking this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
02002013 The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?”
02002014 The man said, “Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and thought, “What I did must have become known.”
02002015 When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well.
02002016 Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father’s flock.
02002017 Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock.
02002018 When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, “Why have you returned so early today?”
02002019 They answered, “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock.”
02002020 “And where is he?” Reuel asked his daughters. “Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat.”
02002021 Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.
02002022 Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, saying, “I have become a foreigner in a foreign land.”
02002023 During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God.
02002024 God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob.
02002025 So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them.
02003001 Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
02003002 There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.
02003003 So Moses thought, “I will go over and see this strange sight—why the bush does not burn up.”
02003004 When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, “Moses! Moses!” And Moses said, “Here I am.”
02003005 “Do not come any closer,” God said. “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.”
02003006 Then he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.” At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.
02003007 The Lord said, “I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering.
02003008 So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
02003009 And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.
02003010 So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.”
02003011 But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”
02003012 And God said, “I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain.”
02003013 Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?”
02003014 God said to Moses, “I am who I am. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I am has sent me to you.’ ”
02003015 God also said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘The Lord, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.’ “This is my name forever, the name you shall call me from generation to generation.
02003016 “Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘The Lord, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—appeared to me and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.
02003017 And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.’
02003018 “The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God.’
02003019 But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him.
02003020 So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go.
02003021 “And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed.
02003022 Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians.”
02004001 Moses answered, “What if they do not believe me or listen to me and say, ‘The Lord did not appear to you’?”
02004002 Then the Lord said to him, “What is that in your hand?” “A staff,” he replied.
02004003 The Lord said, “Throw it on the ground.” Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it.
02004004 Then the Lord said to him, “Reach out your hand and take it by the tail.” So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand.
02004005 “This,” said the Lord, “is so that they may believe that the Lord, the God of their fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has appeared to you.”
02004006 Then the Lord said, “Put your hand inside your cloak.” So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, the skin was leprous —it had become as white as snow.
02004007 “Now put it back into your cloak,” he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh.
02004008 Then the Lord said, “If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first sign, they may believe the second.
02004009 But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground.”
02004010 Moses said to the Lord, “Pardon your servant, Lord. I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue.”
02004011 The Lord said to him, “Who gave human beings their mouths? Who makes them deaf or mute? Who gives them sight or makes them blind? Is it not I, the Lord?
02004012 Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.”
02004013 But Moses said, “Pardon your servant, Lord. Please send someone else.”
02004014 Then the Lord’s anger burned against Moses and he said, “What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and he will be glad to see you.
02004015 You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do.
02004016 He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him.
02004017 But take this staff in your hand so you can perform the signs with it.”
02004018 Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, “Let me return to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive.” Jethro said, “Go, and I wish you well.”
02004019 Now the Lord had said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all those who wanted to kill you are dead.”
02004020 So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand.
02004021 The Lord said to Moses, “When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.
02004022 Then say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the Lord says: Israel is my firstborn son,
02004023 and I told you, “Let my son go, so he may worship me.” But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.’ ”
02004024 At a lodging place on the way, the Lord met Moses and was about to kill him.
02004025 But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son’s foreskin and touched Moses’ feet with it. “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me,” she said.
02004026 So the Lord let him alone. (At that time she said “bridegroom of blood,” referring to circumcision.)
02004027 The Lord said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him.
02004028 Then Moses told Aaron everything the Lord had sent him to say, and also about all the signs he had commanded him to perform.
02004029 Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites,
02004030 and Aaron told them everything the Lord had said to Moses. He also performed the signs before the people,
02004031 and they believed. And when they heard that the Lord was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped.
02005001 Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the wilderness.’ ”
02005002 Pharaoh said, “Who is the Lord, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the Lord and I will not let Israel go.”
02005003 Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword.”
02005004 But the king of Egypt said, “Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!”
02005005 Then Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working.”
02005006 That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and overseers in charge of the people:
02005007 “You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw.
02005008 But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don’t reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’
02005009 Make the work harder for the people so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies.”
02005010 Then the slave drivers and the overseers went out and said to the people, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you any more straw.
02005011 Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.’ ”
02005012 So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw.
02005013 The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, “Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw.”
02005014 And Pharaoh’s slave drivers beat the Israelite overseers they had appointed, demanding, “Why haven’t you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?”
02005015 Then the Israelite overseers went and appealed to Pharaoh: “Why have you treated your servants this way?
02005016 Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.”
02005017 Pharaoh said, “Lazy, that’s what you are—lazy! That is why you keep saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.’
02005018 Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks.”
02005019 The Israelite overseers realized they were in trouble when they were told, “You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day.”
02005020 When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them,
02005021 and they said, “May the Lord look on you and judge you! You have made us obnoxious to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.”
02005022 Moses returned to the Lord and said, “Why, Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Is this why you sent me?
02005023 Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and you have not rescued your people at all.”
02006001 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh: Because of my mighty hand he will let them go; because of my mighty hand he will drive them out of his country.”
02006002 God also said to Moses, “I am the Lord.
02006003 I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name the Lord I did not make myself fully known to them.
02006004 I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, where they resided as foreigners.
02006005 Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant.
02006006 “Therefore, say to the Israelites: ‘I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. I will free you from being slaves to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.
02006007 I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.
02006008 And I will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the Lord.’ ”
02006009 Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and harsh labor.
02006010 Then the Lord said to Moses,
02006011 “Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country.”
02006012 But Moses said to the Lord, “If the Israelites will not listen to me, why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I speak with faltering lips ?”
02006013 Now the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron about the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he commanded them to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.
02006014 These were the heads of their families : The sons of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel were Hanok and Pallu, Hezron and Karmi. These were the clans of Reuben.
02006015 The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon.
02006016 These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their records: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Levi lived 137 years.
02006017 The sons of Gershon, by clans, were Libni and Shimei.
02006018 The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years.
02006019 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of Levi according to their records.
02006020 Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed, who bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years.
02006021 The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg and Zikri.
02006022 The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan and Sithri.
02006023 Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
02006024 The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah and Abiasaph. These were the Korahite clans.
02006025 Eleazar son of Aaron married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These were the heads of the Levite families, clan by clan.
02006026 It was this Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said, “Bring the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.”
02006027 They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt—this same Moses and Aaron.
02006028 Now when the Lord spoke to Moses in Egypt,
02006029 he said to him, “I am the Lord. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I tell you.”
02006030 But Moses said to the Lord, “Since I speak with faltering lips, why would Pharaoh listen to me?”
02007001 Then the Lord said to Moses, “See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet.
02007002 You are to say everything I command you, and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his country.
02007003 But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and though I multiply my signs and wonders in Egypt,
02007004 he will not listen to you. Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and with mighty acts of judgment I will bring out my divisions, my people the Israelites.
02007005 And the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out of it.”
02007006 Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord commanded them.
02007007 Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh.
02007008 The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
02007009 “When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Perform a miracle,’ then say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh,’ and it will become a snake.”
02007010 So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the Lord commanded. Aaron threw his staff down in front of Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a snake.
02007011 Pharaoh then summoned wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians also did the same things by their secret arts:
02007012 Each one threw down his staff and it became a snake. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs.
02007013 Yet Pharaoh’s heart became hard and he would not listen to them, just as the Lord had said.
02007014 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is unyielding; he refuses to let the people go.
02007015 Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the river. Confront him on the bank of the Nile, and take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake.
02007016 Then say to him, ‘The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to say to you: Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the wilderness. But until now you have not listened.
02007017 This is what the Lord says: By this you will know that I am the Lord: With the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water of the Nile, and it will be changed into blood.
02007018 The fish in the Nile will die, and the river will stink; the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water.’ ”
02007019 The Lord said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt—over the streams and canals, over the ponds and all the reservoirs—and they will turn to blood.’ Blood will be everywhere in Egypt, even in vessels of wood and stone.”
02007020 Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord had commanded. He raised his staff in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials and struck the water of the Nile, and all the water was changed into blood.
02007021 The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. Blood was everywhere in Egypt.
02007022 But the Egyptian magicians did the same things by their secret arts, and Pharaoh’s heart became hard; he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had said.
02007023 Instead, he turned and went into his palace, and did not take even this to heart.
02007024 And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile to get drinking water, because they could not drink the water of the river.
02007025 Seven days passed after the Lord struck the Nile.
02008001 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the Lord says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
02008002 If you refuse to let them go, I will send a plague of frogs on your whole country.
02008003 The Nile will teem with frogs. They will come up into your palace and your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and on your people, and into your ovens and kneading troughs.
02008004 The frogs will come up on you and your people and all your officials.’ ”
02008005 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the streams and canals and ponds, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.’ ”
02008006 So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land.
02008007 But the magicians did the same things by their secret arts; they also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt.
02008008 Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to the Lord to take the frogs away from me and my people, and I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord.”
02008009 Moses said to Pharaoh, “I leave to you the honor of setting the time for me to pray for you and your officials and your people that you and your houses may be rid of the frogs, except for those that remain in the Nile.”
02008010 “Tomorrow,” Pharaoh said. Moses replied, “It will be as you say, so that you may know there is no one like the Lord our God.
02008011 The frogs will leave you and your houses, your officials and your people; they will remain only in the Nile.”
02008012 After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the Lord about the frogs he had brought on Pharaoh.
02008013 And the Lord did what Moses asked. The frogs died in the houses, in the courtyards and in the fields.
02008014 They were piled into heaps, and the land reeked of them.
02008015 But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had said.
02008016 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground,’ and throughout the land of Egypt the dust will become gnats.”
02008017 They did this, and when Aaron stretched out his hand with the staff and struck the dust of the ground, gnats came on people and animals. All the dust throughout the land of Egypt became gnats.
02008018 But when the magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, they could not. Since the gnats were on people and animals everywhere,
02008019 the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” But Pharaoh’s heart was hard and he would not listen, just as the Lord had said.
02008020 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the river and say to him, ‘This is what the Lord says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
02008021 If you do not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you and your officials, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies; even the ground will be covered with them.
02008022 “ ‘But on that day I will deal differently with the land of Goshen, where my people live; no swarms of flies will be there, so that you will know that I, the Lord, am in this land.
02008023 I will make a distinction between my people and your people. This sign will occur tomorrow.’ ”
02008024 And the Lord did this. Dense swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh’s palace and into the houses of his officials; throughout Egypt the land was ruined by the flies.
02008025 Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God here in the land.”
02008026 But Moses said, “That would not be right. The sacrifices we offer the Lord our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. And if we offer sacrifices that are detestable in their eyes, will they not stone us?
02008027 We must take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God, as he commands us.”
02008028 Pharaoh said, “I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the Lord your God in the wilderness, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me.”
02008029 Moses answered, “As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the Lord, and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh and his officials and his people. Only let Pharaoh be sure that he does not act deceitfully again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord.”
02008030 Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord,
02008031 and the Lord did what Moses asked. The flies left Pharaoh and his officials and his people; not a fly remained.
02008032 But this time also Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go.
02009001 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: “Let my people go, so that they may worship me.”
02009002 If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them back,
02009003 the hand of the Lord will bring a terrible plague on your livestock in the field—on your horses, donkeys and camels and on your cattle, sheep and goats.
02009004 But the Lord will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that no animal belonging to the Israelites will die.’ ”
02009005 The Lord set a time and said, “Tomorrow the Lord will do this in the land.”
02009006 And the next day the Lord did it: All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died.
02009007 Pharaoh investigated and found that not even one of the animals of the Israelites had died. Yet his heart was unyielding and he would not let the people go.
02009008 Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “Take handfuls of soot from a furnace and have Moses toss it into the air in the presence of Pharaoh.
02009009 It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt, and festering boils will break out on people and animals throughout the land.”
02009010 So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and festering boils broke out on people and animals.
02009011 The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils that were on them and on all the Egyptians.
02009012 But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had said to Moses.
02009013 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning, confront Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me,
02009014 or this time I will send the full force of my plagues against you and against your officials and your people, so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.
02009015 For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth.
02009016 But I have raised you up for this very purpose, that I might show you my power and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.
02009017 You still set yourself against my people and will not let them go.
02009018 Therefore, at this time tomorrow I will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it was founded till now.
02009019 Give an order now to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of shelter, because the hail will fall on every person and animal that has not been brought in and is still out in the field, and they will die.’ ”
02009020 Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the Lord hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock inside.
02009021 But those who ignored the word of the Lord left their slaves and livestock in the field.
02009022 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that hail will fall all over Egypt—on people and animals and on everything growing in the fields of Egypt.”
02009023 When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, the Lord sent thunder and hail, and lightning flashed down to the ground. So the Lord rained hail on the land of Egypt;
02009024 hail fell and lightning flashed back and forth. It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation.
02009025 Throughout Egypt hail struck everything in the fields—both people and animals; it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree.
02009026 The only place it did not hail was the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were.
02009027 Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. “This time I have sinned,” he said to them. “The Lord is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.
02009028 Pray to the Lord, for we have had enough thunder and hail. I will let you go; you don’t have to stay any longer.”
02009029 Moses replied, “When I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands in prayer to the Lord. The thunder will stop and there will be no more hail, so you may know that the earth is the Lord’s.
02009030 But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the Lord God.”
02009031 (The flax and barley were destroyed, since the barley had headed and the flax was in bloom.
02009032 The wheat and spelt, however, were not destroyed, because they ripen later.)
02009033 Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city. He spread out his hands toward the Lord; the thunder and hail stopped, and the rain no longer poured down on the land.
02009034 When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had stopped, he sinned again: He and his officials hardened their hearts.
02009035 So Pharaoh’s heart was hard and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the Lord had said through Moses.
02010001 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials so that I may perform these signs of mine among them
02010002 that you may tell your children and grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and how I performed my signs among them, and that you may know that I am the Lord.”
02010003 So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, “This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
02010004 If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow.
02010005 They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They will devour what little you have left after the hail, including every tree that is growing in your fields.
02010006 They will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians—something neither your parents nor your ancestors have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now.’ ” Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh.
02010007 Pharaoh’s officials said to him, “How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the Lord their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?”
02010008 Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. “Go, worship the Lord your God,” he said. “But tell me who will be going.”
02010009 Moses answered, “We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival to the Lord.”
02010010 Pharaoh said, “The Lord be with you—if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly you are bent on evil.
02010011 No! Have only the men go and worship the Lord, since that’s what you have been asking for.” Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh’s presence.
02010012 And the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail.”
02010013 So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the Lord made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts;
02010014 they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again.
02010015 They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left after the hail—everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.
02010016 Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the Lord your God and against you.
02010017 Now forgive my sin once more and pray to the Lord your God to take this deadly plague away from me.”
02010018 Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord.
02010019 And the Lord changed the wind to a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea. Not a locust was left anywhere in Egypt.
02010020 But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go.
02010021 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt—darkness that can be felt.”
02010022 So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days.
02010023 No one could see anyone else or move about for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.
02010024 Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, “Go, worship the Lord. Even your women and children may go with you; only leave your flocks and herds behind.”
02010025 But Moses said, “You must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the Lord our God.
02010026 Our livestock too must go with us; not a hoof is to be left behind. We have to use some of them in worshiping the Lord our God, and until we get there we will not know what we are to use to worship the Lord.”
02010027 But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was not willing to let them go.
02010028 Pharaoh said to Moses, “Get out of my sight! Make sure you do not appear before me again! The day you see my face you will die.”
02010029 “Just as you say,” Moses replied. “I will never appear before you again.”
02011001 Now the Lord had said to Moses, “I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you go from here, and when he does, he will drive you out completely.
02011002 Tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold.”
02011003 (The Lord made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and Moses himself was highly regarded in Egypt by Pharaoh’s officials and by the people.)
02011004 So Moses said, “This is what the Lord says: ‘About midnight I will go throughout Egypt.
02011005 Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the female slave, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well.
02011006 There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt—worse than there has ever been or ever will be again.
02011007 But among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any person or animal.’ Then you will know that the Lord makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.
02011008 All these officials of yours will come to me, bowing down before me and saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who follow you!’ After that I will leave.” Then Moses, hot with anger, left Pharaoh.
02011009 The Lord had said to Moses, “Pharaoh will refuse to listen to you—so that my wonders may be multiplied in Egypt.”
02011010 Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go out of his country.
02012001 The Lord said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt,
02012002 “This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year.
02012003 Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb for his family, one for each household.
02012004 If any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbor, having taken into account the number of people there are. You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat.
02012005 The animals you choose must be year-old males without defect, and you may take them from the sheep or the goats.
02012006 Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the members of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight.
02012007 Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs.
02012008 That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire, along with bitter herbs, and bread made without yeast.
02012009 Do not eat the meat raw or boiled in water, but roast it over a fire—with the head, legs and internal organs.
02012010 Do not leave any of it till morning; if some is left till morning, you must burn it.
02012011 This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the Lord’s Passover.
02012012 “On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn of both people and animals, and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the Lord.
02012013 The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt.
02012014 “This is a day you are to commemorate; for the generations to come you shall celebrate it as a festival to the Lord—a lasting ordinance.
02012015 For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your houses, for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel.
02012016 On the first day hold a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh day. Do no work at all on these days, except to prepare food for everyone to eat; that is all you may do.
02012017 “Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because it was on this very day that I brought your divisions out of Egypt. Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.
02012018 In the first month you are to eat bread made without yeast, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day.
02012019 For seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses. And anyone, whether foreigner or native-born, who eats anything with yeast in it must be cut off from the community of Israel.
02012020 Eat nothing made with yeast. Wherever you live, you must eat unleavened bread.”
02012021 Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go at once and select the animals for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb.
02012022 Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. None of you shall go out of the door of your house until morning.
02012023 When the Lord goes through the land to strike down the Egyptians, he will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe and will pass over that doorway, and he will not permit the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down.
02012024 “Obey these instructions as a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants.
02012025 When you enter the land that the Lord will give you as he promised, observe this ceremony.
02012026 And when your children ask you, ‘What does this ceremony mean to you?’
02012027 then tell them, ‘It is the Passover sacrifice to the Lord, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes when he struck down the Egyptians.’ ” Then the people bowed down and worshiped.
02012028 The Israelites did just what the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron.
02012029 At midnight the Lord struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner, who was in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the livestock as well.
02012030 Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead.
02012031 During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Up! Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the Lord as you have requested.
02012032 Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go. And also bless me.”
02012033 The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country. “For otherwise,” they said, “we will all die!”
02012034 So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing.
02012035 The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing.
02012036 The Lord had made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians.
02012037 The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Sukkoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.
02012038 Many other people went up with them, and also large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds.
02012039 With the dough the Israelites had brought from Egypt, they baked loaves of unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves.
02012040 Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in Egypt was 430 years.
02012041 At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all the Lord’s divisions left Egypt.
02012042 Because the Lord kept vigil that night to bring them out of Egypt, on this night all the Israelites are to keep vigil to honor the Lord for the generations to come.
02012043 The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “These are the regulations for the Passover meal: “No foreigner may eat it.
02012044 Any slave you have bought may eat it after you have circumcised him,
02012045 but a temporary resident or a hired worker may not eat it.
02012046 “It must be eaten inside the house; take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones.
02012047 The whole community of Israel must celebrate it.
02012048 “A foreigner residing among you who wants to celebrate the Lord’s Passover must have all the males in his household circumcised; then he may take part like one born in the land. No uncircumcised male may eat it.
02012049 The same law applies both to the native-born and to the foreigner residing among you.”
02012050 All the Israelites did just what the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.
02012051 And on that very day the Lord brought the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.
02013001 The Lord said to Moses,
02013002 “Consecrate to me every firstborn male. The first offspring of every womb among the Israelites belongs to me, whether human or animal.”
02013003 Then Moses said to the people, “Commemorate this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery, because the Lord brought you out of it with a mighty hand. Eat nothing containing yeast.
02013004 Today, in the month of Aviv, you are leaving.
02013005 When the Lord brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites and Jebusites—the land he swore to your ancestors to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey—you are to observe this ceremony in this month:
02013006 For seven days eat bread made without yeast and on the seventh day hold a festival to the Lord.
02013007 Eat unleavened bread during those seven days; nothing with yeast in it is to be seen among you, nor shall any yeast be seen anywhere within your borders.
02013008 On that day tell your son, ‘I do this because of what the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt.’
02013009 This observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that this law of the Lord is to be on your lips. For the Lord brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand.
02013010 You must keep this ordinance at the appointed time year after year.
02013011 “After the Lord brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as he promised on oath to you and your ancestors,
02013012 you are to give over to the Lord the first offspring of every womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong to the Lord.
02013013 Redeem with a lamb every firstborn donkey, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem every firstborn among your sons.
02013014 “In days to come, when your son asks you, ‘What does this mean?’ say to him, ‘With a mighty hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
02013015 When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the Lord killed the firstborn of both people and animals in Egypt. This is why I sacrifice to the Lord the first male offspring of every womb and redeem each of my firstborn sons.’
02013016 And it will be like a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead that the Lord brought us out of Egypt with his mighty hand.”
02013017 When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country, though that was shorter. For God said, “If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.”
02013018 So God led the people around by the desert road toward the Red Sea. The Israelites went up out of Egypt ready for battle.
02013019 Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the Israelites swear an oath. He had said, “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up with you from this place.”
02013020 After leaving Sukkoth they camped at Etham on the edge of the desert.
02013021 By day the Lord went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night.
02013022 Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people.
02014001 Then the Lord said to Moses,
02014002 “Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal Zephon.
02014003 Pharaoh will think, ‘The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion, hemmed in by the desert.’
02014004 And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord.” So the Israelites did this.
02014005 When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, “What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and have lost their services!”
02014006 So he had his chariot made ready and took his army with him.
02014007 He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them.
02014008 The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out boldly.
02014009 The Egyptians—all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots, horsemen and troops—pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi Hahiroth, opposite Baal Zephon.
02014010 As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified and cried out to the Lord.
02014011 They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?
02014012 Didn’t we say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians’? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!”
02014013 Moses answered the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again.
02014014 The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still.”
02014015 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on.
02014016 Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.
02014017 I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. And I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen.
02014018 The Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I gain glory through Pharaoh, his chariots and his horsemen.”
02014019 Then the angel of God, who had been traveling in front of Israel’s army, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them,
02014020 coming between the armies of Egypt and Israel. Throughout the night the cloud brought darkness to the one side and light to the other side; so neither went near the other all night long.
02014021 Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the Lord drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided,
02014022 and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left.
02014023 The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots and horsemen followed them into the sea.
02014024 During the last watch of the night the Lord looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army and threw it into confusion.
02014025 He jammed the wheels of their chariots so that they had difficulty driving. And the Egyptians said, “Let’s get away from the Israelites! The Lord is fighting for them against Egypt.”
02014026 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen.”
02014027 Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea went back to its place. The Egyptians were fleeing toward it, and the Lord swept them into the sea.
02014028 The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen—the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived.
02014029 But the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left.
02014030 That day the Lord saved Israel from the hands of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the shore.
02014031 And when the Israelites saw the mighty hand of the Lord displayed against the Egyptians, the people feared the Lord and put their trust in him and in Moses his servant.
02015001 Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord: “I will sing to the Lord, for he is highly exalted. Both horse and driver he has hurled into the sea.
02015002 “The Lord is my strength and my defense ; he has become my salvation. He is my God, and I will praise him, my father’s God, and I will exalt him.
02015003 The Lord is a warrior; the Lord is his name.
02015004 Pharaoh’s chariots and his army he has hurled into the sea. The best of Pharaoh’s officers are drowned in the Red Sea.
02015005 The deep waters have covered them; they sank to the depths like a stone.
02015006 Your right hand, Lord, was majestic in power. Your right hand, Lord, shattered the enemy.
02015007 “In the greatness of your majesty you threw down those who opposed you. You unleashed your burning anger; it consumed them like stubble.
02015008 By the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up. The surging waters stood up like a wall; the deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea.
02015009 The enemy boasted, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake them. I will divide the spoils; I will gorge myself on them. I will draw my sword and my hand will destroy them.’
02015010 But you blew with your breath, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
02015011 Who among the gods is like you, Lord? Who is like you— majestic in holiness, awesome in glory, working wonders?
02015012 “You stretch out your right hand, and the earth swallows your enemies.
02015013 In your unfailing love you will lead the people you have redeemed. In your strength you will guide them to your holy dwelling.
02015014 The nations will hear and tremble; anguish will grip the people of Philistia.
02015015 The chiefs of Edom will be terrified, the leaders of Moab will be seized with trembling, the people of Canaan will melt away;
02015016 terror and dread will fall on them. By the power of your arm they will be as still as a stone— until your people pass by, Lord, until the people you bought pass by.
02015017 You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of your inheritance— the place, Lord, you made for your dwelling, the sanctuary, Lord, your hands established.
02015018 “The Lord reigns for ever and ever.”
02015019 When Pharaoh’s horses, chariots and horsemen went into the sea, the Lord brought the waters of the sea back over them, but the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground.
02015020 Then Miriam the prophet, Aaron’s sister, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women followed her, with timbrels and dancing.
02015021 Miriam sang to them: “Sing to the Lord, for he is highly exalted. Both horse and driver he has hurled into the sea.”
02015022 Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea and they went into the Desert of Shur. For three days they traveled in the desert without finding water.
02015023 When they came to Marah, they could not drink its water because it was bitter. (That is why the place is called Marah. )
02015024 So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, “What are we to drink?”
02015025 Then Moses cried out to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a piece of wood. He threw it into the water, and the water became fit to drink. There the Lord issued a ruling and instruction for them and put them to the test.
02015026 He said, “If you listen carefully to the Lord your God and do what is right in his eyes, if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees, I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the Lord, who heals you.”
02015027 Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there near the water.
02016001 The whole Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had come out of Egypt.
02016002 In the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron.
02016003 The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the Lord’s hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death.”
02016004 Then the Lord said to Moses, “I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions.
02016005 On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in, and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days.”
02016006 So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “In the evening you will know that it was the Lord who brought you out of Egypt,
02016007 and in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we, that you should grumble against us?”
02016008 Moses also said, “You will know that it was the Lord when he gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we? You are not grumbling against us, but against the Lord.”
02016009 Then Moses told Aaron, “Say to the entire Israelite community, ‘Come before the Lord, for he has heard your grumbling.’ ”
02016010 While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community, they looked toward the desert, and there was the glory of the Lord appearing in the cloud.
02016011 The Lord said to Moses,
02016012 “I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God.’ ”
02016013 That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.
02016014 When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor.
02016015 When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread the Lord has given you to eat.
02016016 This is what the Lord has commanded: ‘Everyone is to gather as much as they need. Take an omer for each person you have in your tent.’ ”
02016017 The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered much, some little.
02016018 And when they measured it by the omer, the one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little. Everyone had gathered just as much as they needed.
02016019 Then Moses said to them, “No one is to keep any of it until morning.”
02016020 However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them.
02016021 Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away.
02016022 On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much—two omers for each person—and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses.
02016023 He said to them, “This is what the Lord commanded: ‘Tomorrow is to be a day of sabbath rest, a holy sabbath to the Lord. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.’ ”
02016024 So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it.
02016025 “Eat it today,” Moses said, “because today is a sabbath to the Lord. You will not find any of it on the ground today.
02016026 Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any.”
02016027 Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none.
02016028 Then the Lord said to Moses, “How long will you refuse to keep my commands and my instructions?
02016029 Bear in mind that the Lord has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to stay where they are on the seventh day; no one is to go out.”
02016030 So the people rested on the seventh day.
02016031 The people of Israel called the bread manna. It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey.
02016032 Moses said, “This is what the Lord has commanded: ‘Take an omer of manna and keep it for the generations to come, so they can see the bread I gave you to eat in the wilderness when I brought you out of Egypt.’ ”
02016033 So Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the Lord to be kept for the generations to come.”
02016034 As the Lord commanded Moses, Aaron put the manna with the tablets of the covenant law, so that it might be preserved.
02016035 The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land that was settled; they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan.
02016036 (An omer is one-tenth of an ephah.)
02017001 The whole Israelite community set out from the Desert of Sin, traveling from place to place as the Lord commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.
02017002 So they quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses replied, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you put the Lord to the test?”
02017003 But the people were thirsty for water there, and they grumbled against Moses. They said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?”
02017004 Then Moses cried out to the Lord, “What am I to do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me.”
02017005 The Lord answered Moses, “Go out in front of the people. Take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.
02017006 I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink.” So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel.
02017007 And he called the place Massah and Meribah because the Israelites quarreled and because they tested the Lord saying, “Is the Lord among us or not?”
02017008 The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim.
02017009 Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands.”
02017010 So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron and Hur went to the top of the hill.
02017011 As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning.
02017012 When Moses’ hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up—one on one side, one on the other—so that his hands remained steady till sunset.
02017013 So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword.
02017014 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Write this on a scroll as something to be remembered and make sure that Joshua hears it, because I will completely blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven.”
02017015 Moses built an altar and called it The Lord is my Banner.
02017016 He said, “Because hands were lifted up against the throne of the Lord, the Lord will be at war against the Amalekites from generation to generation.”
02018001 Now Jethro, the priest of Midian and father-in-law of Moses, heard of everything God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, and how the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt.
02018002 After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro received her
02018003 and her two sons. One son was named Gershom, for Moses said, “I have become a foreigner in a foreign land”;
02018004 and the other was named Eliezer, for he said, “My father’s God was my helper; he saved me from the sword of Pharaoh.”
02018005 Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, together with Moses’ sons and wife, came to him in the wilderness, where he was camped near the mountain of God.
02018006 Jethro had sent word to him, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons.”
02018007 So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. They greeted each other and then went into the tent.
02018008 Moses told his father-in-law about everything the Lord had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel’s sake and about all the hardships they had met along the way and how the Lord had saved them.
02018009 Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things the Lord had done for Israel in rescuing them from the hand of the Egyptians.
02018010 He said, “Praise be to the Lord, who rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and who rescued the people from the hand of the Egyptians.
02018011 Now I know that the Lord is greater than all other gods, for he did this to those who had treated Israel arrogantly.”
02018012 Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses’ father-in-law in the presence of God.
02018013 The next day Moses took his seat to serve as judge for the people, and they stood around him from morning till evening.
02018014 When his father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people, he said, “What is this you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as judge, while all these people stand around you from morning till evening?”
02018015 Moses answered him, “Because the people come to me to seek God’s will.
02018016 Whenever they have a dispute, it is brought to me, and I decide between the parties and inform them of God’s decrees and instructions.”
02018017 Moses’ father-in-law replied, “What you are doing is not good.
02018018 You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone.
02018019 Listen now to me and I will give you some advice, and may God be with you. You must be the people’s representative before God and bring their disputes to him.
02018020 Teach them his decrees and instructions, and show them the way they are to live and how they are to behave.
02018021 But select capable men from all the people—men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain—and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens.
02018022 Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them bring every difficult case to you; the simple cases they can decide themselves. That will make your load lighter, because they will share it with you.
02018023 If you do this and God so commands, you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied.”
02018024 Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said.
02018025 He chose capable men from all Israel and made them leaders of the people, officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens.
02018026 They served as judges for the people at all times. The difficult cases they brought to Moses, but the simple ones they decided themselves.
02018027 Then Moses sent his father-in-law on his way, and Jethro returned to his own country.
02019001 On the first day of the third month after the Israelites left Egypt—on that very day—they came to the Desert of Sinai.
02019002 After they set out from Rephidim, they entered the Desert of Sinai, and Israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountain.
02019003 Then Moses went up to God, and the Lord called to him from the mountain and said, “This is what you are to say to the descendants of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel:
02019004 ‘You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself.
02019005 Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine,
02019006 you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites.”
02019007 So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all the words the Lord had commanded him to speak.
02019008 The people all responded together, “We will do everything the Lord has said.” So Moses brought their answer back to the Lord.
02019009 The Lord said to Moses, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you.” Then Moses told the Lord what the people had said.
02019010 And the Lord said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes
02019011 and be ready by the third day, because on that day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
02019012 Put limits for the people around the mountain and tell them, ‘Be careful that you do not approach the mountain or touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain is to be put to death.
02019013 They are to be stoned or shot with arrows; not a hand is to be laid on them. No person or animal shall be permitted to live.’ Only when the ram’s horn sounds a long blast may they approach the mountain.”
02019014 After Moses had gone down the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes.
02019015 Then he said to the people, “Prepare yourselves for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations.”
02019016 On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled.
02019017 Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
02019018 Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the Lord descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, and the whole mountain trembled violently.
02019019 As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him.
02019020 The Lord descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain. So Moses went up
02019021 and the Lord said to him, “Go down and warn the people so they do not force their way through to see the Lord and many of them perish.
02019022 Even the priests, who approach the Lord, must consecrate themselves, or the Lord will break out against them.”
02019023 Moses said to the Lord, “The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, because you yourself warned us, ‘Put limits around the mountain and set it apart as holy.’ ”
02019024 The Lord replied, “Go down and bring Aaron up with you. But the priests and the people must not force their way through to come up to the Lord, or he will break out against them.”
02019025 So Moses went down to the people and told them.
02020001 And God spoke all these words:
02020002 “I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
02020003 “You shall have no other gods before me.
02020004 “You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.
02020005 You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,
02020006 but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.
02020007 “You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.
02020008 “Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
02020009 Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
02020010 but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns.
02020011 For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
02020012 “Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you.
02020013 “You shall not murder.
02020014 “You shall not commit adultery.
02020015 “You shall not steal.
02020016 “You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
02020017 “You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”
02020018 When the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear. They stayed at a distance
02020019 and said to Moses, “Speak to us yourself and we will listen. But do not have God speak to us or we will die.”
02020020 Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid. God has come to test you, so that the fear of God will be with you to keep you from sinning.”
02020021 The people remained at a distance, while Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.
02020022 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites this: ‘You have seen for yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven:
02020023 Do not make any gods to be alongside me; do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gods of gold.
02020024 “ ‘Make an altar of earth for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, your sheep and goats and your cattle. Wherever I cause my name to be honored, I will come to you and bless you.
02020025 If you make an altar of stones for me, do not build it with dressed stones, for you will defile it if you use a tool on it.
02020026 And do not go up to my altar on steps, or your private parts may be exposed.’
02021001 “These are the laws you are to set before them:
02021002 “If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve you for six years. But in the seventh year, he shall go free, without paying anything.
02021003 If he comes alone, he is to go free alone; but if he has a wife when he comes, she is to go with him.
02021004 If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall belong to her master, and only the man shall go free.
02021005 “But if the servant declares, ‘I love my master and my wife and children and do not want to go free,’
02021006 then his master must take him before the judges. He shall take him to the door or the doorpost and pierce his ear with an awl. Then he will be his servant for life.
02021007 “If a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as male servants do.
02021008 If she does not please the master who has selected her for himself, he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners, because he has broken faith with her.
02021009 If he selects her for his son, he must grant her the rights of a daughter.
02021010 If he marries another woman, he must not deprive the first one of her food, clothing and marital rights.
02021011 If he does not provide her with these three things, she is to go free, without any payment of money.
02021012 “Anyone who strikes a person with a fatal blow is to be put to death.
02021013 However, if it is not done intentionally, but God lets it happen, they are to flee to a place I will designate.
02021014 But if anyone schemes and kills someone deliberately, that person is to be taken from my altar and put to death.
02021015 “Anyone who attacks their father or mother is to be put to death.
02021016 “Anyone who kidnaps someone is to be put to death, whether the victim has been sold or is still in the kidnapper’s possession.
02021017 “Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.
02021018 “If people quarrel and one person hits another with a stone or with their fist and the victim does not die but is confined to bed,
02021019 the one who struck the blow will not be held liable if the other can get up and walk around outside with a staff; however, the guilty party must pay the injured person for any loss of time and see that the victim is completely healed.
02021020 “Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result,
02021021 but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property.
02021022 “If people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman’s husband demands and the court allows.
02021023 But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life,
02021024 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
02021025 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.
02021026 “An owner who hits a male or female slave in the eye and destroys it must let the slave go free to compensate for the eye.
02021027 And an owner who knocks out the tooth of a male or female slave must let the slave go free to compensate for the tooth.
02021028 “If a bull gores a man or woman to death, the bull is to be stoned to death, and its meat must not be eaten. But the owner of the bull will not be held responsible.
02021029 If, however, the bull has had the habit of goring and the owner has been warned but has not kept it penned up and it kills a man or woman, the bull is to be stoned and its owner also is to be put to death.
02021030 However, if payment is demanded, the owner may redeem his life by the payment of whatever is demanded.
02021031 This law also applies if the bull gores a son or daughter.
02021032 If the bull gores a male or female slave, the owner must pay thirty shekels of silver to the master of the slave, and the bull is to be stoned to death.
02021033 “If anyone uncovers a pit or digs one and fails to cover it and an ox or a donkey falls into it,
02021034 the one who opened the pit must pay the owner for the loss and take the dead animal in exchange.
02021035 “If anyone’s bull injures someone else’s bull and it dies, the two parties are to sell the live one and divide both the money and the dead animal equally.
02021036 However, if it was known that the bull had the habit of goring, yet the owner did not keep it penned up, the owner must pay, animal for animal, and take the dead animal in exchange.
02022001 “Whoever steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters it or sells it must pay back five head of cattle for the ox and four sheep for the sheep.
02022002 “If a thief is caught breaking in at night and is struck a fatal blow, the defender is not guilty of bloodshed;
02022003 but if it happens after sunrise, the defender is guilty of bloodshed. “Anyone who steals must certainly make restitution, but if they have nothing, they must be sold to pay for their theft.
02022004 If the stolen animal is found alive in their possession—whether ox or donkey or sheep—they must pay back double.
02022005 “If anyone grazes their livestock in a field or vineyard and lets them stray and they graze in someone else’s field, the offender must make restitution from the best of their own field or vineyard.
02022006 “If a fire breaks out and spreads into thornbushes so that it burns shocks of grain or standing grain or the whole field, the one who started the fire must make restitution.
02022007 “If anyone gives a neighbor silver or goods for safekeeping and they are stolen from the neighbor’s house, the thief, if caught, must pay back double.
02022008 But if the thief is not found, the owner of the house must appear before the judges, and they must determine whether the owner of the house has laid hands on the other person’s property.
02022009 In all cases of illegal possession of an ox, a donkey, a sheep, a garment, or any other lost property about which somebody says, ‘This is mine,’ both parties are to bring their cases before the judges. The one whom the judges declare guilty must pay back double to the other.
02022010 “If anyone gives a donkey, an ox, a sheep or any other animal to their neighbor for safekeeping and it dies or is injured or is taken away while no one is looking,
02022011 the issue between them will be settled by the taking of an oath before the Lord that the neighbor did not lay hands on the other person’s property. The owner is to accept this, and no restitution is required.
02022012 But if the animal was stolen from the neighbor, restitution must be made to the owner.
02022013 If it was torn to pieces by a wild animal, the neighbor shall bring in the remains as evidence and shall not be required to pay for the torn animal.
02022014 “If anyone borrows an animal from their neighbor and it is injured or dies while the owner is not present, they must make restitution.
02022015 But if the owner is with the animal, the borrower will not have to pay. If the animal was hired, the money paid for the hire covers the loss.
02022016 “If a man seduces a virgin who is not pledged to be married and sleeps with her, he must pay the bride-price, and she shall be his wife.
02022017 If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him, he must still pay the bride-price for virgins.
02022018 “Do not allow a sorceress to live.
02022019 “Anyone who has sexual relations with an animal is to be put to death.
02022020 “Whoever sacrifices to any god other than the Lord must be destroyed.
02022021 “Do not mistreat or oppress a foreigner, for you were foreigners in Egypt.
02022022 “Do not take advantage of the widow or the fatherless.
02022023 If you do and they cry out to me, I will certainly hear their cry.
02022024 My anger will be aroused, and I will kill you with the sword; your wives will become widows and your children fatherless.
02022025 “If you lend money to one of my people among you who is needy, do not treat it like a business deal; charge no interest.
02022026 If you take your neighbor’s cloak as a pledge, return it by sunset,
02022027 because that cloak is the only covering your neighbor has. What else can they sleep in? When they cry out to me, I will hear, for I am compassionate.
02022028 “Do not blaspheme God or curse the ruler of your people.
02022029 “Do not hold back offerings from your granaries or your vats. “You must give me the firstborn of your sons.
02022030 Do the same with your cattle and your sheep. Let them stay with their mothers for seven days, but give them to me on the eighth day.
02022031 “You are to be my holy people. So do not eat the meat of an animal torn by wild beasts; throw it to the dogs.
02023001 “Do not spread false reports. Do not help a guilty person by being a malicious witness.
02023002 “Do not follow the crowd in doing wrong. When you give testimony in a lawsuit, do not pervert justice by siding with the crowd,
02023003 and do not show favoritism to a poor person in a lawsuit.
02023004 “If you come across your enemy’s ox or donkey wandering off, be sure to return it.
02023005 If you see the donkey of someone who hates you fallen down under its load, do not leave it there; be sure you help them with it.
02023006 “Do not deny justice to your poor people in their lawsuits.
02023007 Have nothing to do with a false charge and do not put an innocent or honest person to death, for I will not acquit the guilty.
02023008 “Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds those who see and twists the words of the innocent.
02023009 “Do not oppress a foreigner; you yourselves know how it feels to be foreigners, because you were foreigners in Egypt.
02023010 “For six years you are to sow your fields and harvest the crops,
02023011 but during the seventh year let the land lie unplowed and unused. Then the poor among your people may get food from it, and the wild animals may eat what is left. Do the same with your vineyard and your olive grove.
02023012 “Six days do your work, but on the seventh day do not work, so that your ox and your donkey may rest, and so that the slave born in your household and the foreigner living among you may be refreshed.
02023013 “Be careful to do everything I have said to you. Do not invoke the names of other gods; do not let them be heard on your lips.
02023014 “Three times a year you are to celebrate a festival to me.
02023015 “Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread; for seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you. Do this at the appointed time in the month of Aviv, for in that month you came out of Egypt. “No one is to appear before me empty-handed.
02023016 “Celebrate the Festival of Harvest with the firstfruits of the crops you sow in your field. “Celebrate the Festival of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you gather in your crops from the field.
02023017 “Three times a year all the men are to appear before the Sovereign Lord.
02023018 “Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast. “The fat of my festival offerings must not be kept until morning.
02023019 “Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the Lord your God. “Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.
02023020 “See, I am sending an angel ahead of you to guard you along the way and to bring you to the place I have prepared.
02023021 Pay attention to him and listen to what he says. Do not rebel against him; he will not forgive your rebellion, since my Name is in him.
02023022 If you listen carefully to what he says and do all that I say, I will be an enemy to your enemies and will oppose those who oppose you.
02023023 My angel will go ahead of you and bring you into the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites and Jebusites, and I will wipe them out.
02023024 Do not bow down before their gods or worship them or follow their practices. You must demolish them and break their sacred stones to pieces.
02023025 Worship the Lord your God, and his blessing will be on your food and water. I will take away sickness from among you,
02023026 and none will miscarry or be barren in your land. I will give you a full life span.
02023027 “I will send my terror ahead of you and throw into confusion every nation you encounter. I will make all your enemies turn their backs and run.
02023028 I will send the hornet ahead of you to drive the Hivites, Canaanites and Hittites out of your way.
02023029 But I will not drive them out in a single year, because the land would become desolate and the wild animals too numerous for you.
02023030 Little by little I will drive them out before you, until you have increased enough to take possession of the land.
02023031 “I will establish your borders from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, and from the desert to the Euphrates River. I will give into your hands the people who live in the land, and you will drive them out before you.
02023032 Do not make a covenant with them or with their gods.
02023033 Do not let them live in your land or they will cause you to sin against me, because the worship of their gods will certainly be a snare to you.”
02024001 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Come up to the Lord, you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel. You are to worship at a distance,
02024002 but Moses alone is to approach the Lord; the others must not come near. And the people may not come up with him.”
02024003 When Moses went and told the people all the Lord’s words and laws, they responded with one voice, “Everything the Lord has said we will do.”
02024004 Moses then wrote down everything the Lord had said. He got up early the next morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain and set up twelve stone pillars representing the twelve tribes of Israel.
02024005 Then he sent young Israelite men, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls as fellowship offerings to the Lord.
02024006 Moses took half of the blood and put it in bowls, and the other half he splashed against the altar.
02024007 Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it to the people. They responded, “We will do everything the Lord has said; we will obey.”
02024008 Moses then took the blood, sprinkled it on the people and said, “This is the blood of the covenant that the Lord has made with you in accordance with all these words.”
02024009 Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the seventy elders of Israel went up
02024010 and saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was something like a pavement made of lapis lazuli, as bright blue as the sky.
02024011 But God did not raise his hand against these leaders of the Israelites; they saw God, and they ate and drank.
02024012 The Lord said to Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain and stay here, and I will give you the tablets of stone with the law and commandments I have written for their instruction.”
02024013 Then Moses set out with Joshua his aide, and Moses went up on the mountain of God.
02024014 He said to the elders, “Wait here for us until we come back to you. Aaron and Hur are with you, and anyone involved in a dispute can go to them.”
02024015 When Moses went up on the mountain, the cloud covered it,
02024016 and the glory of the Lord settled on Mount Sinai. For six days the cloud covered the mountain, and on the seventh day the Lord called to Moses from within the cloud.
02024017 To the Israelites the glory of the Lord looked like a consuming fire on top of the mountain.
02024018 Then Moses entered the cloud as he went on up the mountain. And he stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights.
02025001 The Lord said to Moses,
02025002 “Tell the Israelites to bring me an offering. You are to receive the offering for me from everyone whose heart prompts them to give.
02025003 These are the offerings you are to receive from them: gold, silver and bronze;
02025004 blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen; goat hair;
02025005 ram skins dyed red and another type of durable leather ; acacia wood;
02025006 olive oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense;
02025007 and onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.
02025008 “Then have them make a sanctuary for me, and I will dwell among them.
02025009 Make this tabernacle and all its furnishings exactly like the pattern I will show you.
02025010 “Have them make an ark of acacia wood—two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high.
02025011 Overlay it with pure gold, both inside and out, and make a gold molding around it.
02025012 Cast four gold rings for it and fasten them to its four feet, with two rings on one side and two rings on the other.
02025013 Then make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
02025014 Insert the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry it.
02025015 The poles are to remain in the rings of this ark; they are not to be removed.
02025016 Then put in the ark the tablets of the covenant law, which I will give you.
02025017 “Make an atonement cover of pure gold—two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.
02025018 And make two cherubim out of hammered gold at the ends of the cover.
02025019 Make one cherub on one end and the second cherub on the other; make the cherubim of one piece with the cover, at the two ends.
02025020 The cherubim are to have their wings spread upward, overshadowing the cover with them. The cherubim are to face each other, looking toward the cover.
02025021 Place the cover on top of the ark and put in the ark the tablets of the covenant law that I will give you.
02025022 There, above the cover between the two cherubim that are over the ark of the covenant law, I will meet with you and give you all my commands for the Israelites.
02025023 “Make a table of acacia wood—two cubits long, a cubit wide and a cubit and a half high.
02025024 Overlay it with pure gold and make a gold molding around it.
02025025 Also make around it a rim a handbreadth wide and put a gold molding on the rim.
02025026 Make four gold rings for the table and fasten them to the four corners, where the four legs are.
02025027 The rings are to be close to the rim to hold the poles used in carrying the table.
02025028 Make the poles of acacia wood, overlay them with gold and carry the table with them.
02025029 And make its plates and dishes of pure gold, as well as its pitchers and bowls for the pouring out of offerings.
02025030 Put the bread of the Presence on this table to be before me at all times.
02025031 “Make a lampstand of pure gold. Hammer out its base and shaft, and make its flowerlike cups, buds and blossoms of one piece with them.
02025032 Six branches are to extend from the sides of the lampstand—three on one side and three on the other.
02025033 Three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms are to be on one branch, three on the next branch, and the same for all six branches extending from the lampstand.
02025034 And on the lampstand there are to be four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms.
02025035 One bud shall be under the first pair of branches extending from the lampstand, a second bud under the second pair, and a third bud under the third pair—six branches in all.
02025036 The buds and branches shall all be of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold.
02025037 “Then make its seven lamps and set them up on it so that they light the space in front of it.
02025038 Its wick trimmers and trays are to be of pure gold.
02025039 A talent of pure gold is to be used for the lampstand and all these accessories.
02025040 See that you make them according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.
02026001 “Make the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, with cherubim woven into them by a skilled worker.
02026002 All the curtains are to be the same size—twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide.
02026003 Join five of the curtains together, and do the same with the other five.
02026004 Make loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and do the same with the end curtain in the other set.
02026005 Make fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the other set, with the loops opposite each other.
02026006 Then make fifty gold clasps and use them to fasten the curtains together so that the tabernacle is a unit.
02026007 “Make curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle—eleven altogether.
02026008 All eleven curtains are to be the same size—thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.
02026009 Join five of the curtains together into one set and the other six into another set. Fold the sixth curtain double at the front of the tent.
02026010 Make fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and also along the edge of the end curtain in the other set.
02026011 Then make fifty bronze clasps and put them in the loops to fasten the tent together as a unit.
02026012 As for the additional length of the tent curtains, the half curtain that is left over is to hang down at the rear of the tabernacle.
02026013 The tent curtains will be a cubit longer on both sides; what is left will hang over the sides of the tabernacle so as to cover it.
02026014 Make for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of the other durable leather.
02026015 “Make upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.
02026016 Each frame is to be ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide,
02026017 with two projections set parallel to each other. Make all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.
02026018 Make twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle
02026019 and make forty silver bases to go under them—two bases for each frame, one under each projection.
02026020 For the other side, the north side of the tabernacle, make twenty frames
02026021 and forty silver bases—two under each frame.
02026022 Make six frames for the far end, that is, the west end of the tabernacle,
02026023 and make two frames for the corners at the far end.
02026024 At these two corners they must be double from the bottom all the way to the top and fitted into a single ring; both shall be like that.
02026025 So there will be eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame.
02026026 “Also make crossbars of acacia wood: five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,
02026027 five for those on the other side, and five for the frames on the west, at the far end of the tabernacle.
02026028 The center crossbar is to extend from end to end at the middle of the frames.
02026029 Overlay the frames with gold and make gold rings to hold the crossbars. Also overlay the crossbars with gold.
02026030 “Set up the tabernacle according to the plan shown you on the mountain.
02026031 “Make a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, with cherubim woven into it by a skilled worker.
02026032 Hang it with gold hooks on four posts of acacia wood overlaid with gold and standing on four silver bases.
02026033 Hang the curtain from the clasps and place the ark of the covenant law behind the curtain. The curtain will separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place.
02026034 Put the atonement cover on the ark of the covenant law in the Most Holy Place.
02026035 Place the table outside the curtain on the north side of the tabernacle and put the lampstand opposite it on the south side.
02026036 “For the entrance to the tent make a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer.
02026037 Make gold hooks for this curtain and five posts of acacia wood overlaid with gold. And cast five bronze bases for them.
02027001 “Build an altar of acacia wood, three cubits high; it is to be square, five cubits long and five cubits wide.
02027002 Make a horn at each of the four corners, so that the horns and the altar are of one piece, and overlay the altar with bronze.
02027003 Make all its utensils of bronze—its pots to remove the ashes, and its shovels, sprinkling bowls, meat forks and firepans.
02027004 Make a grating for it, a bronze network, and make a bronze ring at each of the four corners of the network.
02027005 Put it under the ledge of the altar so that it is halfway up the altar.
02027006 Make poles of acacia wood for the altar and overlay them with bronze.
02027007 The poles are to be inserted into the rings so they will be on two sides of the altar when it is carried.
02027008 Make the altar hollow, out of boards. It is to be made just as you were shown on the mountain.
02027009 “Make a courtyard for the tabernacle. The south side shall be a hundred cubits long and is to have curtains of finely twisted linen,
02027010 with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases and with silver hooks and bands on the posts.
02027011 The north side shall also be a hundred cubits long and is to have curtains, with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases and with silver hooks and bands on the posts.
02027012 “The west end of the courtyard shall be fifty cubits wide and have curtains, with ten posts and ten bases.
02027013 On the east end, toward the sunrise, the courtyard shall also be fifty cubits wide.
02027014 Curtains fifteen cubits long are to be on one side of the entrance, with three posts and three bases,
02027015 and curtains fifteen cubits long are to be on the other side, with three posts and three bases.
02027016 “For the entrance to the courtyard, provide a curtain twenty cubits long, of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer—with four posts and four bases.
02027017 All the posts around the courtyard are to have silver bands and hooks, and bronze bases.
02027018 The courtyard shall be a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide, with curtains of finely twisted linen five cubits high, and with bronze bases.
02027019 All the other articles used in the service of the tabernacle, whatever their function, including all the tent pegs for it and those for the courtyard, are to be of bronze.
02027020 “Command the Israelites to bring you clear oil of pressed olives for the light so that the lamps may be kept burning.
02027021 In the tent of meeting, outside the curtain that shields the ark of the covenant law, Aaron and his sons are to keep the lamps burning before the Lord from evening till morning. This is to be a lasting ordinance among the Israelites for the generations to come.
02028001 “Have Aaron your brother brought to you from among the Israelites, along with his sons Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, so they may serve me as priests.
02028002 Make sacred garments for your brother Aaron to give him dignity and honor.
02028003 Tell all the skilled workers to whom I have given wisdom in such matters that they are to make garments for Aaron, for his consecration, so he may serve me as priest.
02028004 These are the garments they are to make: a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a woven tunic, a turban and a sash. They are to make these sacred garments for your brother Aaron and his sons, so they may serve me as priests.
02028005 Have them use gold, and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and fine linen.
02028006 “Make the ephod of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen—the work of skilled hands.
02028007 It is to have two shoulder pieces attached to two of its corners, so it can be fastened.
02028008 Its skillfully woven waistband is to be like it—of one piece with the ephod and made with gold, and with blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and with finely twisted linen.
02028009 “Take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel
02028010 in the order of their birth—six names on one stone and the remaining six on the other.
02028011 Engrave the names of the sons of Israel on the two stones the way a gem cutter engraves a seal. Then mount the stones in gold filigree settings
02028012 and fasten them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel. Aaron is to bear the names on his shoulders as a memorial before the Lord.
02028013 Make gold filigree settings
02028014 and two braided chains of pure gold, like a rope, and attach the chains to the settings.
02028015 “Fashion a breastpiece for making decisions—the work of skilled hands. Make it like the ephod: of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen.
02028016 It is to be square—a span long and a span wide—and folded double.
02028017 Then mount four rows of precious stones on it. The first row shall be carnelian, chrysolite and beryl;
02028018 the second row shall be turquoise, lapis lazuli and emerald;
02028019 the third row shall be jacinth, agate and amethyst;
02028020 the fourth row shall be topaz, onyx and jasper. Mount them in gold filigree settings.
02028021 There are to be twelve stones, one for each of the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes.
02028022 “For the breastpiece make braided chains of pure gold, like a rope.
02028023 Make two gold rings for it and fasten them to two corners of the breastpiece.
02028024 Fasten the two gold chains to the rings at the corners of the breastpiece,
02028025 and the other ends of the chains to the two settings, attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front.
02028026 Make two gold rings and attach them to the other two corners of the breastpiece on the inside edge next to the ephod.
02028027 Make two more gold rings and attach them to the bottom of the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod, close to the seam just above the waistband of the ephod.
02028028 The rings of the breastpiece are to be tied to the rings of the ephod with blue cord, connecting it to the waistband, so that the breastpiece will not swing out from the ephod.
02028029 “Whenever Aaron enters the Holy Place, he will bear the names of the sons of Israel over his heart on the breastpiece of decision as a continuing memorial before the Lord.
02028030 Also put the Urim and the Thummim in the breastpiece, so they may be over Aaron’s heart whenever he enters the presence of the Lord. Thus Aaron will always bear the means of making decisions for the Israelites over his heart before the Lord.
02028031 “Make the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth,
02028032 with an opening for the head in its center. There shall be a woven edge like a collar around this opening, so that it will not tear.
02028033 Make pomegranates of blue, purple and scarlet yarn around the hem of the robe, with gold bells between them.
02028034 The gold bells and the pomegranates are to alternate around the hem of the robe.
02028035 Aaron must wear it when he ministers. The sound of the bells will be heard when he enters the Holy Place before the Lord and when he comes out, so that he will not die.
02028036 “Make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it as on a seal: holy to the Lord.
02028037 Fasten a blue cord to it to attach it to the turban; it is to be on the front of the turban.
02028038 It will be on Aaron’s forehead, and he will bear the guilt involved in the sacred gifts the Israelites consecrate, whatever their gifts may be. It will be on Aaron’s forehead continually so that they will be acceptable to the Lord.
02028039 “Weave the tunic of fine linen and make the turban of fine linen. The sash is to be the work of an embroiderer.
02028040 Make tunics, sashes and caps for Aaron’s sons to give them dignity and honor.
02028041 After you put these clothes on your brother Aaron and his sons, anoint and ordain them. Consecrate them so they may serve me as priests.
02028042 “Make linen undergarments as a covering for the body, reaching from the waist to the thigh.
02028043 Aaron and his sons must wear them whenever they enter the tent of meeting or approach the altar to minister in the Holy Place, so that they will not incur guilt and die. “This is to be a lasting ordinance for Aaron and his descendants.
02029001 “This is what you are to do to consecrate them, so they may serve me as priests: Take a young bull and two rams without defect.
02029002 And from the finest wheat flour make round loaves without yeast, thick loaves without yeast and with olive oil mixed in, and thin loaves without yeast and brushed with olive oil.
02029003 Put them in a basket and present them along with the bull and the two rams.
02029004 Then bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the tent of meeting and wash them with water.
02029005 Take the garments and dress Aaron with the tunic, the robe of the ephod, the ephod itself and the breastpiece. Fasten the ephod on him by its skillfully woven waistband.
02029006 Put the turban on his head and attach the sacred emblem to the turban.
02029007 Take the anointing oil and anoint him by pouring it on his head.
02029008 Bring his sons and dress them in tunics
02029009 and fasten caps on them. Then tie sashes on Aaron and his sons. The priesthood is theirs by a lasting ordinance. “Then you shall ordain Aaron and his sons.
02029010 “Bring the bull to the front of the tent of meeting, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head.
02029011 Slaughter it in the Lord’s presence at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
02029012 Take some of the bull’s blood and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, and pour out the rest of it at the base of the altar.
02029013 Then take all the fat on the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, and both kidneys with the fat on them, and burn them on the altar.
02029014 But burn the bull’s flesh and its hide and its intestines outside the camp. It is a sin offering.
02029015 “Take one of the rams, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head.
02029016 Slaughter it and take the blood and splash it against the sides of the altar.
02029017 Cut the ram into pieces and wash the internal organs and the legs, putting them with the head and the other pieces.
02029018 Then burn the entire ram on the altar. It is a burnt offering to the Lord, a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the Lord.
02029019 “Take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head.
02029020 Slaughter it, take some of its blood and put it on the lobes of the right ears of Aaron and his sons, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. Then splash blood against the sides of the altar.
02029021 And take some blood from the altar and some of the anointing oil and sprinkle it on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and their garments. Then he and his sons and their garments will be consecrated.
02029022 “Take from this ram the fat, the fat tail, the fat on the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, both kidneys with the fat on them, and the right thigh. (This is the ram for the ordination.)
02029023 From the basket of bread made without yeast, which is before the Lord, take one round loaf, one thick loaf with olive oil mixed in, and one thin loaf.
02029024 Put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons and have them wave them before the Lord as a wave offering.
02029025 Then take them from their hands and burn them on the altar along with the burnt offering for a pleasing aroma to the Lord, a food offering presented to the Lord.
02029026 After you take the breast of the ram for Aaron’s ordination, wave it before the Lord as a wave offering, and it will be your share.
02029027 “Consecrate those parts of the ordination ram that belong to Aaron and his sons: the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented.
02029028 This is always to be the perpetual share from the Israelites for Aaron and his sons. It is the contribution the Israelites are to make to the Lord from their fellowship offerings.
02029029 “Aaron’s sacred garments will belong to his descendants so that they can be anointed and ordained in them.
02029030 The son who succeeds him as priest and comes to the tent of meeting to minister in the Holy Place is to wear them seven days.
02029031 “Take the ram for the ordination and cook the meat in a sacred place.
02029032 At the entrance to the tent of meeting, Aaron and his sons are to eat the meat of the ram and the bread that is in the basket.
02029033 They are to eat these offerings by which atonement was made for their ordination and consecration. But no one else may eat them, because they are sacred.
02029034 And if any of the meat of the ordination ram or any bread is left over till morning, burn it up. It must not be eaten, because it is sacred.
02029035 “Do for Aaron and his sons everything I have commanded you, taking seven days to ordain them.
02029036 Sacrifice a bull each day as a sin offering to make atonement. Purify the altar by making atonement for it, and anoint it to consecrate it.
02029037 For seven days make atonement for the altar and consecrate it. Then the altar will be most holy, and whatever touches it will be holy.
02029038 “This is what you are to offer on the altar regularly each day: two lambs a year old.
02029039 Offer one in the morning and the other at twilight.
02029040 With the first lamb offer a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil from pressed olives, and a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink offering.
02029041 Sacrifice the other lamb at twilight with the same grain offering and its drink offering as in the morning—a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the Lord.
02029042 “For the generations to come this burnt offering is to be made regularly at the entrance to the tent of meeting, before the Lord. There I will meet you and speak to you;
02029043 there also I will meet with the Israelites, and the place will be consecrated by my glory.
02029044 “So I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar and will consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve me as priests.
02029045 Then I will dwell among the Israelites and be their God.
02029046 They will know that I am the Lord their God, who brought them out of Egypt so that I might dwell among them. I am the Lord their God.
02030001 “Make an altar of acacia wood for burning incense.
02030002 It is to be square, a cubit long and a cubit wide, and two cubits high —its horns of one piece with it.
02030003 Overlay the top and all the sides and the horns with pure gold, and make a gold molding around it.
02030004 Make two gold rings for the altar below the molding—two on each of the opposite sides—to hold the poles used to carry it.
02030005 Make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
02030006 Put the altar in front of the curtain that shields the ark of the covenant law—before the atonement cover that is over the tablets of the covenant law—where I will meet with you.
02030007 “Aaron must burn fragrant incense on the altar every morning when he tends the lamps.
02030008 He must burn incense again when he lights the lamps at twilight so incense will burn regularly before the Lord for the generations to come.
02030009 Do not offer on this altar any other incense or any burnt offering or grain offering, and do not pour a drink offering on it.
02030010 Once a year Aaron shall make atonement on its horns. This annual atonement must be made with the blood of the atoning sin offering for the generations to come. It is most holy to the Lord.”
02030011 Then the Lord said to Moses,
02030012 “When you take a census of the Israelites to count them, each one must pay the Lord a ransom for his life at the time he is counted. Then no plague will come on them when you number them.
02030013 Each one who crosses over to those already counted is to give a half shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs. This half shekel is an offering to the Lord.
02030014 All who cross over, those twenty years old or more, are to give an offering to the Lord.
02030015 The rich are not to give more than a half shekel and the poor are not to give less when you make the offering to the Lord to atone for your lives.
02030016 Receive the atonement money from the Israelites and use it for the service of the tent of meeting. It will be a memorial for the Israelites before the Lord, making atonement for your lives.”
02030017 Then the Lord said to Moses,
02030018 “Make a bronze basin, with its bronze stand, for washing. Place it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it.
02030019 Aaron and his sons are to wash their hands and feet with water from it.
02030020 Whenever they enter the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water so that they will not die. Also, when they approach the altar to minister by presenting a food offering to the Lord,
02030021 they shall wash their hands and feet so that they will not die. This is to be a lasting ordinance for Aaron and his descendants for the generations to come.”
02030022 Then the Lord said to Moses,
02030023 “Take the following fine spices: 500 shekels of liquid myrrh, half as much (that is, 250 shekels) of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels of fragrant calamus,
02030024 500 shekels of cassia—all according to the sanctuary shekel—and a hin of olive oil.
02030025 Make these into a sacred anointing oil, a fragrant blend, the work of a perfumer. It will be the sacred anointing oil.
02030026 Then use it to anoint the tent of meeting, the ark of the covenant law,
02030027 the table and all its articles, the lampstand and its accessories, the altar of incense,
02030028 the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the basin with its stand.
02030029 You shall consecrate them so they will be most holy, and whatever touches them will be holy.
02030030 “Anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them so they may serve me as priests.
02030031 Say to the Israelites, ‘This is to be my sacred anointing oil for the generations to come.
02030032 Do not pour it on anyone else’s body and do not make any other oil using the same formula. It is sacred, and you are to consider it sacred.
02030033 Whoever makes perfume like it and puts it on anyone other than a priest must be cut off from their people.’ ”
02030034 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Take fragrant spices—gum resin, onycha and galbanum—and pure frankincense, all in equal amounts,
02030035 and make a fragrant blend of incense, the work of a perfumer. It is to be salted and pure and sacred.
02030036 Grind some of it to powder and place it in front of the ark of the covenant law in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be most holy to you.
02030037 Do not make any incense with this formula for yourselves; consider it holy to the Lord.
02030038 Whoever makes incense like it to enjoy its fragrance must be cut off from their people.”
02031001 Then the Lord said to Moses,
02031002 “See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,
02031003 and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills—
02031004 to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze,
02031005 to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of crafts.
02031006 Moreover, I have appointed Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan, to help him. Also I have given ability to all the skilled workers to make everything I have commanded you:
02031007 the tent of meeting, the ark of the covenant law with the atonement cover on it, and all the other furnishings of the tent—
02031008 the table and its articles, the pure gold lampstand and all its accessories, the altar of incense,
02031009 the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, the basin with its stand—
02031010 and also the woven garments, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests,
02031011 and the anointing oil and fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them just as I commanded you.”
02031012 Then the Lord said to Moses,
02031013 “Say to the Israelites, ‘You must observe my Sabbaths. This will be a sign between me and you for the generations to come, so you may know that I am the Lord, who makes you holy.
02031014 “ ‘Observe the Sabbath, because it is holy to you. Anyone who desecrates it is to be put to death; those who do any work on that day must be cut off from their people.
02031015 For six days work is to be done, but the seventh day is a day of sabbath rest, holy to the Lord. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day is to be put to death.
02031016 The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant.
02031017 It will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.’ ”
02031018 When the Lord finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the covenant law, the tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God.
02032001 When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, “Come, make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don’t know what has happened to him.”
02032002 Aaron answered them, “Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me.”
02032003 So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron.
02032004 He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioning it with a tool. Then they said, “These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.”
02032005 When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf and announced, “Tomorrow there will be a festival to the Lord.”
02032006 So the next day the people rose early and sacrificed burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings. Afterward they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.
02032007 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go down, because your people, whom you brought up out of Egypt, have become corrupt.
02032008 They have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.’
02032009 “I have seen these people,” the Lord said to Moses, “and they are a stiff-necked people.
02032010 Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation.”
02032011 But Moses sought the favor of the Lord his God. “Lord,” he said, “why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?
02032012 Why should the Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth’? Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on your people.
02032013 Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self: ‘I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.’ ”
02032014 Then the Lord relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened.
02032015 Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back.
02032016 The tablets were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.
02032017 When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, “There is the sound of war in the camp.”
02032018 Moses replied: “It is not the sound of victory, it is not the sound of defeat; it is the sound of singing that I hear.”
02032019 When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain.
02032020 And he took the calf the people had made and burned it in the fire; then he ground it to powder, scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it.
02032021 He said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?”
02032022 “Do not be angry, my lord,” Aaron answered. “You know how prone these people are to evil.
02032023 They said to me, ‘Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don’t know what has happened to him.’
02032024 So I told them, ‘Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.’ Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!”
02032025 Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies.
02032026 So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, “Whoever is for the Lord, come to me.” And all the Levites rallied to him.
02032027 Then he said to them, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.’ ”
02032028 The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died.
02032029 Then Moses said, “You have been set apart to the Lord today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day.”
02032030 The next day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the Lord; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.”
02032031 So Moses went back to the Lord and said, “Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves gods of gold.
02032032 But now, please forgive their sin—but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written.”
02032033 The Lord replied to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book.
02032034 Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and my angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish them for their sin.”
02032035 And the Lord struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made.
02033001 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Leave this place, you and the people you brought up out of Egypt, and go up to the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’
02033002 I will send an angel before you and drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
02033003 Go up to the land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go with you, because you are a stiff-necked people and I might destroy you on the way.”
02033004 When the people heard these distressing words, they began to mourn and no one put on any ornaments.
02033005 For the Lord had said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites, ‘You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go with you even for a moment, I might destroy you. Now take off your ornaments and I will decide what to do with you.’ ”
02033006 So the Israelites stripped off their ornaments at Mount Horeb.
02033007 Now Moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp some distance away, calling it the “tent of meeting.” Anyone inquiring of the Lord would go to the tent of meeting outside the camp.
02033008 And whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose and stood at the entrances to their tents, watching Moses until he entered the tent.
02033009 As Moses went into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the entrance, while the Lord spoke with Moses.
02033010 Whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they all stood and worshiped, each at the entrance to their tent.
02033011 The Lord would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young aide Joshua son of Nun did not leave the tent.
02033012 Moses said to the Lord, “You have been telling me, ‘Lead these people,’ but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. You have said, ‘I know you by name and you have found favor with me.’
02033013 If you are pleased with me, teach me your ways so I may know you and continue to find favor with you. Remember that this nation is your people.”
02033014 The Lord replied, “My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”
02033015 Then Moses said to him, “If your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here.
02033016 How will anyone know that you are pleased with me and with your people unless you go with us? What else will distinguish me and your people from all the other people on the face of the earth?”
02033017 And the Lord said to Moses, “I will do the very thing you have asked, because I am pleased with you and I know you by name.”
02033018 Then Moses said, “Now show me your glory.”
02033019 And the Lord said, “I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the Lord, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
02033020 But,” he said, “you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live.”
02033021 Then the Lord said, “There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock.
02033022 When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by.
02033023 Then I will remove my hand and you will see my back; but my face must not be seen.”
02034001 The Lord said to Moses, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.
02034002 Be ready in the morning, and then come up on Mount Sinai. Present yourself to me there on top of the mountain.
02034003 No one is to come with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain; not even the flocks and herds may graze in front of the mountain.”
02034004 So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and went up Mount Sinai early in the morning, as the Lord had commanded him; and he carried the two stone tablets in his hands.
02034005 Then the Lord came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his name, the Lord.
02034006 And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, “The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness,
02034007 maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.”
02034008 Moses bowed to the ground at once and worshiped.
02034009 “Lord,” he said, “if I have found favor in your eyes, then let the Lord go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, forgive our wickedness and our sin, and take us as your inheritance.”
02034010 Then the Lord said: “I am making a covenant with you. Before all your people I will do wonders never before done in any nation in all the world. The people you live among will see how awesome is the work that I, the Lord, will do for you.
02034011 Obey what I command you today. I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
02034012 Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land where you are going, or they will be a snare among you.
02034013 Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and cut down their Asherah poles.
02034014 Do not worship any other god, for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.
02034015 “Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land; for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you and you will eat their sacrifices.
02034016 And when you choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons and those daughters prostitute themselves to their gods, they will lead your sons to do the same.
02034017 “Do not make any idols.
02034018 “Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread. For seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you. Do this at the appointed time in the month of Aviv, for in that month you came out of Egypt.
02034019 “The first offspring of every womb belongs to me, including all the firstborn males of your livestock, whether from herd or flock.
02034020 Redeem the firstborn donkey with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem all your firstborn sons. “No one is to appear before me empty-handed.
02034021 “Six days you shall labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even during the plowing season and harvest you must rest.
02034022 “Celebrate the Festival of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Festival of Ingathering at the turn of the year.
02034023 Three times a year all your men are to appear before the Sovereign Lord, the God of Israel.
02034024 I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your territory, and no one will covet your land when you go up three times each year to appear before the Lord your God.
02034025 “Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast, and do not let any of the sacrifice from the Passover Festival remain until morning.
02034026 “Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the Lord your God. “Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.”
02034027 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.”
02034028 Moses was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant—the Ten Commandments.
02034029 When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands, he was not aware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the Lord.
02034030 When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, his face was radiant, and they were afraid to come near him.
02034031 But Moses called to them; so Aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him, and he spoke to them.
02034032 Afterward all the Israelites came near him, and he gave them all the commands the Lord had given him on Mount Sinai.
02034033 When Moses finished speaking to them, he put a veil over his face.
02034034 But whenever he entered the Lord’s presence to speak with him, he removed the veil until he came out. And when he came out and told the Israelites what he had been commanded,
02034035 they saw that his face was radiant. Then Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with the Lord.
02035001 Moses assembled the whole Israelite community and said to them, “These are the things the Lord has commanded you to do:
02035002 For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a day of sabbath rest to the Lord. Whoever does any work on it is to be put to death.
02035003 Do not light a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day.”
02035004 Moses said to the whole Israelite community, “This is what the Lord has commanded:
02035005 From what you have, take an offering for the Lord. Everyone who is willing is to bring to the Lord an offering of gold, silver and bronze;
02035006 blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen; goat hair;
02035007 ram skins dyed red and another type of durable leather ; acacia wood;
02035008 olive oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense;
02035009 and onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.
02035010 “All who are skilled among you are to come and make everything the Lord has commanded:
02035011 the tabernacle with its tent and its covering, clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and bases;
02035012 the ark with its poles and the atonement cover and the curtain that shields it;
02035013 the table with its poles and all its articles and the bread of the Presence;
02035014 the lampstand that is for light with its accessories, lamps and oil for the light;
02035015 the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense; the curtain for the doorway at the entrance to the tabernacle;
02035016 the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils; the bronze basin with its stand;
02035017 the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard;
02035018 the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the courtyard, and their ropes;
02035019 the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary—both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests.”
02035020 Then the whole Israelite community withdrew from Moses’ presence,
02035021 and everyone who was willing and whose heart moved them came and brought an offering to the Lord for the work on the tent of meeting, for all its service, and for the sacred garments.
02035022 All who were willing, men and women alike, came and brought gold jewelry of all kinds: brooches, earrings, rings and ornaments. They all presented their gold as a wave offering to the Lord.
02035023 Everyone who had blue, purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen, or goat hair, ram skins dyed red or the other durable leather brought them.
02035024 Those presenting an offering of silver or bronze brought it as an offering to the Lord, and everyone who had acacia wood for any part of the work brought it.
02035025 Every skilled woman spun with her hands and brought what she had spun—blue, purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen.
02035026 And all the women who were willing and had the skill spun the goat hair.
02035027 The leaders brought onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.
02035028 They also brought spices and olive oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense.
02035029 All the Israelite men and women who were willing brought to the Lord freewill offerings for all the work the Lord through Moses had commanded them to do.
02035030 Then Moses said to the Israelites, “See, the Lord has chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,
02035031 and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills—
02035032 to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze,
02035033 to cut and set stones, to work in wood and to engage in all kinds of artistic crafts.
02035034 And he has given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach others.
02035035 He has filled them with skill to do all kinds of work as engravers, designers, embroiderers in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen, and weavers—all of them skilled workers and designers.
02036001 So Bezalel, Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the Lord has given skill and ability to know how to carry out all the work of constructing the sanctuary are to do the work just as the Lord has commanded.”
02036002 Then Moses summoned Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the Lord had given ability and who was willing to come and do the work.
02036003 They received from Moses all the offerings the Israelites had brought to carry out the work of constructing the sanctuary. And the people continued to bring freewill offerings morning after morning.
02036004 So all the skilled workers who were doing all the work on the sanctuary left what they were doing
02036005 and said to Moses, “The people are bringing more than enough for doing the work the Lord commanded to be done.”
02036006 Then Moses gave an order and they sent this word throughout the camp: “No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary.” And so the people were restrained from bringing more,
02036007 because what they already had was more than enough to do all the work.
02036008 All those who were skilled among the workers made the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, with cherubim woven into them by expert hands.
02036009 All the curtains were the same size—twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide.
02036010 They joined five of the curtains together and did the same with the other five.
02036011 Then they made loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and the same was done with the end curtain in the other set.
02036012 They also made fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the other set, with the loops opposite each other.
02036013 Then they made fifty gold clasps and used them to fasten the two sets of curtains together so that the tabernacle was a unit.
02036014 They made curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle—eleven altogether.
02036015 All eleven curtains were the same size—thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.
02036016 They joined five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another set.
02036017 Then they made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and also along the edge of the end curtain in the other set.
02036018 They made fifty bronze clasps to fasten the tent together as a unit.
02036019 Then they made for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of the other durable leather.
02036020 They made upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.
02036021 Each frame was ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide,
02036022 with two projections set parallel to each other. They made all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.
02036023 They made twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle
02036024 and made forty silver bases to go under them—two bases for each frame, one under each projection.
02036025 For the other side, the north side of the tabernacle, they made twenty frames
02036026 and forty silver bases—two under each frame.
02036027 They made six frames for the far end, that is, the west end of the tabernacle,
02036028 and two frames were made for the corners of the tabernacle at the far end.
02036029 At these two corners the frames were double from the bottom all the way to the top and fitted into a single ring; both were made alike.
02036030 So there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame.
02036031 They also made crossbars of acacia wood: five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,
02036032 five for those on the other side, and five for the frames on the west, at the far end of the tabernacle.
02036033 They made the center crossbar so that it extended from end to end at the middle of the frames.
02036034 They overlaid the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the crossbars. They also overlaid the crossbars with gold.
02036035 They made the curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, with cherubim woven into it by a skilled worker.
02036036 They made four posts of acacia wood for it and overlaid them with gold. They made gold hooks for them and cast their four silver bases.
02036037 For the entrance to the tent they made a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer;
02036038 and they made five posts with hooks for them. They overlaid the tops of the posts and their bands with gold and made their five bases of bronze.
02037001 Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood—two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high.
02037002 He overlaid it with pure gold, both inside and out, and made a gold molding around it.
02037003 He cast four gold rings for it and fastened them to its four feet, with two rings on one side and two rings on the other.
02037004 Then he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
02037005 And he inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry it.
02037006 He made the atonement cover of pure gold—two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.
02037007 Then he made two cherubim out of hammered gold at the ends of the cover.
02037008 He made one cherub on one end and the second cherub on the other; at the two ends he made them of one piece with the cover.
02037009 The cherubim had their wings spread upward, overshadowing the cover with them. The cherubim faced each other, looking toward the cover.
02037010 They made the table of acacia wood—two cubits long, a cubit wide and a cubit and a half high.
02037011 Then they overlaid it with pure gold and made a gold molding around it.
02037012 They also made around it a rim a handbreadth wide and put a gold molding on the rim.
02037013 They cast four gold rings for the table and fastened them to the four corners, where the four legs were.
02037014 The rings were put close to the rim to hold the poles used in carrying the table.
02037015 The poles for carrying the table were made of acacia wood and were overlaid with gold.
02037016 And they made from pure gold the articles for the table—its plates and dishes and bowls and its pitchers for the pouring out of drink offerings.
02037017 They made the lampstand of pure gold. They hammered out its base and shaft, and made its flowerlike cups, buds and blossoms of one piece with them.
02037018 Six branches extended from the sides of the lampstand—three on one side and three on the other.
02037019 Three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms were on one branch, three on the next branch and the same for all six branches extending from the lampstand.
02037020 And on the lampstand were four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms.
02037021 One bud was under the first pair of branches extending from the lampstand, a second bud under the second pair, and a third bud under the third pair—six branches in all.
02037022 The buds and the branches were all of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold.
02037023 They made its seven lamps, as well as its wick trimmers and trays, of pure gold.
02037024 They made the lampstand and all its accessories from one talent of pure gold.
02037025 They made the altar of incense out of acacia wood. It was square, a cubit long and a cubit wide and two cubits high —its horns of one piece with it.
02037026 They overlaid the top and all the sides and the horns with pure gold, and made a gold molding around it.
02037027 They made two gold rings below the molding—two on each of the opposite sides—to hold the poles used to carry it.
02037028 They made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
02037029 They also made the sacred anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense—the work of a perfumer.
02038001 They built the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood, three cubits high; it was square, five cubits long and five cubits wide.
02038002 They made a horn at each of the four corners, so that the horns and the altar were of one piece, and they overlaid the altar with bronze.
02038003 They made all its utensils of bronze—its pots, shovels, sprinkling bowls, meat forks and firepans.
02038004 They made a grating for the altar, a bronze network, to be under its ledge, halfway up the altar.
02038005 They cast bronze rings to hold the poles for the four corners of the bronze grating.
02038006 They made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze.
02038007 They inserted the poles into the rings so they would be on the sides of the altar for carrying it. They made it hollow, out of boards.
02038008 They made the bronze basin and its bronze stand from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
02038009 Next they made the courtyard. The south side was a hundred cubits long and had curtains of finely twisted linen,
02038010 with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, and with silver hooks and bands on the posts.
02038011 The north side was also a hundred cubits long and had twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts.
02038012 The west end was fifty cubits wide and had curtains, with ten posts and ten bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts.
02038013 The east end, toward the sunrise, was also fifty cubits wide.
02038014 Curtains fifteen cubits long were on one side of the entrance, with three posts and three bases,
02038015 and curtains fifteen cubits long were on the other side of the entrance to the courtyard, with three posts and three bases.
02038016 All the curtains around the courtyard were of finely twisted linen.
02038017 The bases for the posts were bronze. The hooks and bands on the posts were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver; so all the posts of the courtyard had silver bands.
02038018 The curtain for the entrance to the courtyard was made of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer. It was twenty cubits long and, like the curtains of the courtyard, five cubits high,
02038019 with four posts and four bronze bases. Their hooks and bands were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver.
02038020 All the tent pegs of the tabernacle and of the surrounding courtyard were bronze.
02038021 These are the amounts of the materials used for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the covenant law, which were recorded at Moses’ command by the Levites under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest.
02038022 (Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything the Lord commanded Moses;
02038023 with him was Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan—an engraver and designer, and an embroiderer in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen.)
02038024 The total amount of the gold from the wave offering used for all the work on the sanctuary was 29 talents and 730 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.
02038025 The silver obtained from those of the community who were counted in the census was 100 talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel—
02038026 one beka per person, that is, half a shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel, from everyone who had crossed over to those counted, twenty years old or more, a total of 603,550 men.
02038027 The 100 talents of silver were used to cast the bases for the sanctuary and for the curtain—100 bases from the 100 talents, one talent for each base.
02038028 They used the 1,775 shekels to make the hooks for the posts, to overlay the tops of the posts, and to make their bands.
02038029 The bronze from the wave offering was 70 talents and 2,400 shekels.
02038030 They used it to make the bases for the entrance to the tent of meeting, the bronze altar with its bronze grating and all its utensils,
02038031 the bases for the surrounding courtyard and those for its entrance and all the tent pegs for the tabernacle and those for the surrounding courtyard.
02039001 From the blue, purple and scarlet yarn they made woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary. They also made sacred garments for Aaron, as the Lord commanded Moses.
02039002 They made the ephod of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen.
02039003 They hammered out thin sheets of gold and cut strands to be worked into the blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen—the work of skilled hands.
02039004 They made shoulder pieces for the ephod, which were attached to two of its corners, so it could be fastened.
02039005 Its skillfully woven waistband was like it—of one piece with the ephod and made with gold, and with blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and with finely twisted linen, as the Lord commanded Moses.
02039006 They mounted the onyx stones in gold filigree settings and engraved them like a seal with the names of the sons of Israel.
02039007 Then they fastened them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the Lord commanded Moses.
02039008 They fashioned the breastpiece—the work of a skilled craftsman. They made it like the ephod: of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen.
02039009 It was square—a span long and a span wide—and folded double.
02039010 Then they mounted four rows of precious stones on it. The first row was carnelian, chrysolite and beryl;
02039011 the second row was turquoise, lapis lazuli and emerald;
02039012 the third row was jacinth, agate and amethyst;
02039013 the fourth row was topaz, onyx and jasper. They were mounted in gold filigree settings.
02039014 There were twelve stones, one for each of the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes.
02039015 For the breastpiece they made braided chains of pure gold, like a rope.
02039016 They made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and fastened the rings to two of the corners of the breastpiece.
02039017 They fastened the two gold chains to the rings at the corners of the breastpiece,
02039018 and the other ends of the chains to the two settings, attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front.
02039019 They made two gold rings and attached them to the other two corners of the breastpiece on the inside edge next to the ephod.
02039020 Then they made two more gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod, close to the seam just above the waistband of the ephod.
02039021 They tied the rings of the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod with blue cord, connecting it to the waistband so that the breastpiece would not swing out from the ephod—as the Lord commanded Moses.
02039022 They made the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth—the work of a weaver—
02039023 with an opening in the center of the robe like the opening of a collar, and a band around this opening, so that it would not tear.
02039024 They made pomegranates of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen around the hem of the robe.
02039025 And they made bells of pure gold and attached them around the hem between the pomegranates.
02039026 The bells and pomegranates alternated around the hem of the robe to be worn for ministering, as the Lord commanded Moses.
02039027 For Aaron and his sons, they made tunics of fine linen—the work of a weaver—
02039028 and the turban of fine linen, the linen caps and the undergarments of finely twisted linen.
02039029 The sash was made of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn—the work of an embroiderer—as the Lord commanded Moses.
02039030 They made the plate, the sacred emblem, out of pure gold and engraved on it, like an inscription on a seal: holy to the Lord.
02039031 Then they fastened a blue cord to it to attach it to the turban, as the Lord commanded Moses.
02039032 So all the work on the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, was completed. The Israelites did everything just as the Lord commanded Moses.
02039033 Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses: the tent and all its furnishings, its clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and bases;
02039034 the covering of ram skins dyed red and the covering of another durable leather and the shielding curtain;
02039035 the ark of the covenant law with its poles and the atonement cover;
02039036 the table with all its articles and the bread of the Presence;
02039037 the pure gold lampstand with its row of lamps and all its accessories, and the olive oil for the light;
02039038 the gold altar, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the entrance to the tent;
02039039 the bronze altar with its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils; the basin with its stand;
02039040 the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard; the ropes and tent pegs for the courtyard; all the furnishings for the tabernacle, the tent of meeting;
02039041 and the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when serving as priests.
02039042 The Israelites had done all the work just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
02039043 Moses inspected the work and saw that they had done it just as the Lord had commanded. So Moses blessed them.
02040001 Then the Lord said to Moses:
02040002 “Set up the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, on the first day of the first month.
02040003 Place the ark of the covenant law in it and shield the ark with the curtain.
02040004 Bring in the table and set out what belongs on it. Then bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps.
02040005 Place the gold altar of incense in front of the ark of the covenant law and put the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
02040006 “Place the altar of burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting;
02040007 place the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it.
02040008 Set up the courtyard around it and put the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard.
02040009 “Take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it; consecrate it and all its furnishings, and it will be holy.
02040010 Then anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils; consecrate the altar, and it will be most holy.
02040011 Anoint the basin and its stand and consecrate them.
02040012 “Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the tent of meeting and wash them with water.
02040013 Then dress Aaron in the sacred garments, anoint him and consecrate him so he may serve me as priest.
02040014 Bring his sons and dress them in tunics.
02040015 Anoint them just as you anointed their father, so they may serve me as priests. Their anointing will be to a priesthood that will continue throughout their generations.”
02040016 Moses did everything just as the Lord commanded him.
02040017 So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month in the second year.
02040018 When Moses set up the tabernacle, he put the bases in place, erected the frames, inserted the crossbars and set up the posts.
02040019 Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent, as the Lord commanded him.
02040020 He took the tablets of the covenant law and placed them in the ark, attached the poles to the ark and put the atonement cover over it.
02040021 Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle and hung the shielding curtain and shielded the ark of the covenant law, as the Lord commanded him.
02040022 Moses placed the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle outside the curtain
02040023 and set out the bread on it before the Lord, as the Lord commanded him.
02040024 He placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle
02040025 and set up the lamps before the Lord, as the Lord commanded him.
02040026 Moses placed the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the curtain
02040027 and burned fragrant incense on it, as the Lord commanded him.
02040028 Then he put up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
02040029 He set the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, and offered on it burnt offerings and grain offerings, as the Lord commanded him.
02040030 He placed the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing,
02040031 and Moses and Aaron and his sons used it to wash their hands and feet.
02040032 They washed whenever they entered the tent of meeting or approached the altar, as the Lord commanded Moses.
02040033 Then Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar and put up the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. And so Moses finished the work.
02040034 Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
02040035 Moses could not enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
02040036 In all the travels of the Israelites, whenever the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle, they would set out;
02040037 but if the cloud did not lift, they did not set out—until the day it lifted.
02040038 So the cloud of the Lord was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the Israelites during all their travels.
03001001 The Lord called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting. He said,
03001002 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When anyone among you brings an offering to the Lord, bring as your offering an animal from either the herd or the flock.
03001003 “ ‘If the offering is a burnt offering from the herd, you are to offer a male without defect. You must present it at the entrance to the tent of meeting so that it will be acceptable to the Lord.
03001004 You are to lay your hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted on your behalf to make atonement for you.
03001005 You are to slaughter the young bull before the Lord, and then Aaron’s sons the priests shall bring the blood and splash it against the sides of the altar at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
03001006 You are to skin the burnt offering and cut it into pieces.
03001007 The sons of Aaron the priest are to put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire.
03001008 Then Aaron’s sons the priests shall arrange the pieces, including the head and the fat, on the wood that is burning on the altar.
03001009 You are to wash the internal organs and the legs with water, and the priest is to burn all of it on the altar. It is a burnt offering, a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
03001010 “ ‘If the offering is a burnt offering from the flock, from either the sheep or the goats, you are to offer a male without defect.
03001011 You are to slaughter it at the north side of the altar before the Lord, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall splash its blood against the sides of the altar.
03001012 You are to cut it into pieces, and the priest shall arrange them, including the head and the fat, on the wood that is burning on the altar.
03001013 You are to wash the internal organs and the legs with water, and the priest is to bring all of them and burn them on the altar. It is a burnt offering, a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
03001014 “ ‘If the offering to the Lord is a burnt offering of birds, you are to offer a dove or a young pigeon.
03001015 The priest shall bring it to the altar, wring off the head and burn it on the altar; its blood shall be drained out on the side of the altar.
03001016 He is to remove the crop and the feathers and throw them down east of the altar where the ashes are.
03001017 He shall tear it open by the wings, not dividing it completely, and then the priest shall burn it on the wood that is burning on the altar. It is a burnt offering, a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
03002001 “ ‘When anyone brings a grain offering to the Lord, their offering is to be of the finest flour. They are to pour olive oil on it, put incense on it
03002002 and take it to Aaron’s sons the priests. The priest shall take a handful of the flour and oil, together with all the incense, and burn this as a memorial portion on the altar, a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
03002003 The rest of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the food offerings presented to the Lord.
03002004 “ ‘If you bring a grain offering baked in an oven, it is to consist of the finest flour: either thick loaves made without yeast and with olive oil mixed in or thin loaves made without yeast and brushed with olive oil.
03002005 If your grain offering is prepared on a griddle, it is to be made of the finest flour mixed with oil, and without yeast.
03002006 Crumble it and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering.
03002007 If your grain offering is cooked in a pan, it is to be made of the finest flour and some olive oil.
03002008 Bring the grain offering made of these things to the Lord; present it to the priest, who shall take it to the altar.
03002009 He shall take out the memorial portion from the grain offering and burn it on the altar as a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
03002010 The rest of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the food offerings presented to the Lord.
03002011 “ ‘Every grain offering you bring to the Lord must be made without yeast, for you are not to burn any yeast or honey in a food offering presented to the Lord.
03002012 You may bring them to the Lord as an offering of the firstfruits, but they are not to be offered on the altar as a pleasing aroma.
03002013 Season all your grain offerings with salt. Do not leave the salt of the covenant of your God out of your grain offerings; add salt to all your offerings.
03002014 “ ‘If you bring a grain offering of firstfruits to the Lord, offer crushed heads of new grain roasted in the fire.
03002015 Put oil and incense on it; it is a grain offering.
03002016 The priest shall burn the memorial portion of the crushed grain and the oil, together with all the incense, as a food offering presented to the Lord.
03003001 “ ‘If your offering is a fellowship offering, and you offer an animal from the herd, whether male or female, you are to present before the Lord an animal without defect.
03003002 You are to lay your hand on the head of your offering and slaughter it at the entrance to the tent of meeting. Then Aaron’s sons the priests shall splash the blood against the sides of the altar.
03003003 From the fellowship offering you are to bring a food offering to the Lord: the internal organs and all the fat that is connected to them,
03003004 both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver, which you will remove with the kidneys.
03003005 Then Aaron’s sons are to burn it on the altar on top of the burnt offering that is lying on the burning wood; it is a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
03003006 “ ‘If you offer an animal from the flock as a fellowship offering to the Lord, you are to offer a male or female without defect.
03003007 If you offer a lamb, you are to present it before the Lord,
03003008 lay your hand on its head and slaughter it in front of the tent of meeting. Then Aaron’s sons shall splash its blood against the sides of the altar.
03003009 From the fellowship offering you are to bring a food offering to the Lord: its fat, the entire fat tail cut off close to the backbone, the internal organs and all the fat that is connected to them,
03003010 both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver, which you will remove with the kidneys.
03003011 The priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering presented to the Lord.
03003012 “ ‘If your offering is a goat, you are to present it before the Lord,
03003013 lay your hand on its head and slaughter it in front of the tent of meeting. Then Aaron’s sons shall splash its blood against the sides of the altar.
03003014 From what you offer you are to present this food offering to the Lord: the internal organs and all the fat that is connected to them,
03003015 both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver, which you will remove with the kidneys.
03003016 The priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering, a pleasing aroma. All the fat is the Lord’s.
03003017 “ ‘This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live: You must not eat any fat or any blood.’ ”
03004001 The Lord said to Moses,
03004002 “Say to the Israelites: ‘When anyone sins unintentionally and does what is forbidden in any of the Lord’s commands—
03004003 “ ‘If the anointed priest sins, bringing guilt on the people, he must bring to the Lord a young bull without defect as a sin offering for the sin he has committed.
03004004 He is to present the bull at the entrance to the tent of meeting before the Lord. He is to lay his hand on its head and slaughter it there before the Lord.
03004005 Then the anointed priest shall take some of the bull’s blood and carry it into the tent of meeting.
03004006 He is to dip his finger into the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times before the Lord, in front of the curtain of the sanctuary.
03004007 The priest shall then put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense that is before the Lord in the tent of meeting. The rest of the bull’s blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
03004008 He shall remove all the fat from the bull of the sin offering—all the fat that is connected to the internal organs,
03004009 both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver, which he will remove with the kidneys—
03004010 just as the fat is removed from the ox sacrificed as a fellowship offering. Then the priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering.
03004011 But the hide of the bull and all its flesh, as well as the head and legs, the internal organs and the intestines—
03004012 that is, all the rest of the bull—he must take outside the camp to a place ceremonially clean, where the ashes are thrown, and burn it there in a wood fire on the ash heap.
03004013 “ ‘If the whole Israelite community sins unintentionally and does what is forbidden in any of the Lord’s commands, even though the community is unaware of the matter, when they realize their guilt
03004014 and the sin they committed becomes known, the assembly must bring a young bull as a sin offering and present it before the tent of meeting.
03004015 The elders of the community are to lay their hands on the bull’s head before the Lord, and the bull shall be slaughtered before the Lord.
03004016 Then the anointed priest is to take some of the bull’s blood into the tent of meeting.
03004017 He shall dip his finger into the blood and sprinkle it before the Lord seven times in front of the curtain.
03004018 He is to put some of the blood on the horns of the altar that is before the Lord in the tent of meeting. The rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
03004019 He shall remove all the fat from it and burn it on the altar,
03004020 and do with this bull just as he did with the bull for the sin offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for the community, and they will be forgiven.
03004021 Then he shall take the bull outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull. This is the sin offering for the community.
03004022 “ ‘When a leader sins unintentionally and does what is forbidden in any of the commands of the Lord his God, when he realizes his guilt
03004023 and the sin he has committed becomes known, he must bring as his offering a male goat without defect.
03004024 He is to lay his hand on the goat’s head and slaughter it at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered before the Lord. It is a sin offering.
03004025 Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
03004026 He shall burn all the fat on the altar as he burned the fat of the fellowship offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for the leader’s sin, and he will be forgiven.
03004027 “ ‘If any member of the community sins unintentionally and does what is forbidden in any of the Lord’s commands, when they realize their guilt
03004028 and the sin they have committed becomes known, they must bring as their offering for the sin they committed a female goat without defect.
03004029 They are to lay their hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it at the place of the burnt offering.
03004030 Then the priest is to take some of the blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
03004031 They shall remove all the fat, just as the fat is removed from the fellowship offering, and the priest shall burn it on the altar as an aroma pleasing to the Lord. In this way the priest will make atonement for them, and they will be forgiven.
03004032 “ ‘If someone brings a lamb as their sin offering, they are to bring a female without defect.
03004033 They are to lay their hand on its head and slaughter it for a sin offering at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered.
03004034 Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
03004035 They shall remove all the fat, just as the fat is removed from the lamb of the fellowship offering, and the priest shall burn it on the altar on top of the food offerings presented to the Lord. In this way the priest will make atonement for them for the sin they have committed, and they will be forgiven.
03005001 “ ‘If anyone sins because they do not speak up when they hear a public charge to testify regarding something they have seen or learned about, they will be held responsible.
03005002 “ ‘If anyone becomes aware that they are guilty—if they unwittingly touch anything ceremonially unclean (whether the carcass of an unclean animal, wild or domestic, or of any unclean creature that moves along the ground) and they are unaware that they have become unclean, but then they come to realize their guilt;
03005003 or if they touch human uncleanness (anything that would make them unclean) even though they are unaware of it, but then they learn of it and realize their guilt;
03005004 or if anyone thoughtlessly takes an oath to do anything, whether good or evil (in any matter one might carelessly swear about) even though they are unaware of it, but then they learn of it and realize their guilt—
03005005 when anyone becomes aware that they are guilty in any of these matters, they must confess in what way they have sinned.
03005006 As a penalty for the sin they have committed, they must bring to the Lord a female lamb or goat from the flock as a sin offering ; and the priest shall make atonement for them for their sin.
03005007 “ ‘Anyone who cannot afford a lamb is to bring two doves or two young pigeons to the Lord as a penalty for their sin—one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.
03005008 They are to bring them to the priest, who shall first offer the one for the sin offering. He is to wring its head from its neck, not dividing it completely,
03005009 and is to splash some of the blood of the sin offering against the side of the altar; the rest of the blood must be drained out at the base of the altar. It is a sin offering.
03005010 The priest shall then offer the other as a burnt offering in the prescribed way and make atonement for them for the sin they have committed, and they will be forgiven.
03005011 “ ‘If, however, they cannot afford two doves or two young pigeons, they are to bring as an offering for their sin a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour for a sin offering. They must not put olive oil or incense on it, because it is a sin offering.
03005012 They are to bring it to the priest, who shall take a handful of it as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar on top of the food offerings presented to the Lord. It is a sin offering.
03005013 In this way the priest will make atonement for them for any of these sins they have committed, and they will be forgiven. The rest of the offering will belong to the priest, as in the case of the grain offering.’ ”
03005014 The Lord said to Moses:
03005015 “When anyone is unfaithful to the Lord by sinning unintentionally in regard to any of the Lord’s holy things, they are to bring to the Lord as a penalty a ram from the flock, one without defect and of the proper value in silver, according to the sanctuary shekel. It is a guilt offering.
03005016 They must make restitution for what they have failed to do in regard to the holy things, pay an additional penalty of a fifth of its value and give it all to the priest. The priest will make atonement for them with the ram as a guilt offering, and they will be forgiven.
03005017 “If anyone sins and does what is forbidden in any of the Lord’s commands, even though they do not know it, they are guilty and will be held responsible.
03005018 They are to bring to the priest as a guilt offering a ram from the flock, one without defect and of the proper value. In this way the priest will make atonement for them for the wrong they have committed unintentionally, and they will be forgiven.
03005019 It is a guilt offering; they have been guilty of wrongdoing against the Lord.”
03006001 The Lord said to Moses:
03006002 “If anyone sins and is unfaithful to the Lord by deceiving a neighbor about something entrusted to them or left in their care or about something stolen, or if they cheat their neighbor,
03006003 or if they find lost property and lie about it, or if they swear falsely about any such sin that people may commit—
03006004 when they sin in any of these ways and realize their guilt, they must return what they have stolen or taken by extortion, or what was entrusted to them, or the lost property they found,
03006005 or whatever it was they swore falsely about. They must make restitution in full, add a fifth of the value to it and give it all to the owner on the day they present their guilt offering.
03006006 And as a penalty they must bring to the priest, that is, to the Lord, their guilt offering, a ram from the flock, one without defect and of the proper value.
03006007 In this way the priest will make atonement for them before the Lord, and they will be forgiven for any of the things they did that made them guilty.”
03006008 The Lord said to Moses:
03006009 “Give Aaron and his sons this command: ‘These are the regulations for the burnt offering: The burnt offering is to remain on the altar hearth throughout the night, till morning, and the fire must be kept burning on the altar.
03006010 The priest shall then put on his linen clothes, with linen undergarments next to his body, and shall remove the ashes of the burnt offering that the fire has consumed on the altar and place them beside the altar.
03006011 Then he is to take off these clothes and put on others, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a place that is ceremonially clean.
03006012 The fire on the altar must be kept burning; it must not go out. Every morning the priest is to add firewood and arrange the burnt offering on the fire and burn the fat of the fellowship offerings on it.
03006013 The fire must be kept burning on the altar continuously; it must not go out.
03006014 “ ‘These are the regulations for the grain offering: Aaron’s sons are to bring it before the Lord, in front of the altar.
03006015 The priest is to take a handful of the finest flour and some olive oil, together with all the incense on the grain offering, and burn the memorial portion on the altar as an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
03006016 Aaron and his sons shall eat the rest of it, but it is to be eaten without yeast in the sanctuary area; they are to eat it in the courtyard of the tent of meeting.
03006017 It must not be baked with yeast; I have given it as their share of the food offerings presented to me. Like the sin offering and the guilt offering, it is most holy.
03006018 Any male descendant of Aaron may eat it. For all generations to come it is his perpetual share of the food offerings presented to the Lord. Whatever touches them will become holy. ’ ”
03006019 The Lord also said to Moses,
03006020 “This is the offering Aaron and his sons are to bring to the Lord on the day he is anointed: a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half in the evening.
03006021 It must be prepared with oil on a griddle; bring it well-mixed and present the grain offering broken in pieces as an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
03006022 The son who is to succeed him as anointed priest shall prepare it. It is the Lord’s perpetual share and is to be burned completely.
03006023 Every grain offering of a priest shall be burned completely; it must not be eaten.”
03006024 The Lord said to Moses,
03006025 “Say to Aaron and his sons: ‘These are the regulations for the sin offering: The sin offering is to be slaughtered before the Lord in the place the burnt offering is slaughtered; it is most holy.
03006026 The priest who offers it shall eat it; it is to be eaten in the sanctuary area, in the courtyard of the tent of meeting.
03006027 Whatever touches any of the flesh will become holy, and if any of the blood is spattered on a garment, you must wash it in the sanctuary area.
03006028 The clay pot the meat is cooked in must be broken; but if it is cooked in a bronze pot, the pot is to be scoured and rinsed with water.
03006029 Any male in a priest’s family may eat it; it is most holy.
03006030 But any sin offering whose blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place must not be eaten; it must be burned up.
03007001 “ ‘These are the regulations for the guilt offering, which is most holy:
03007002 The guilt offering is to be slaughtered in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, and its blood is to be splashed against the sides of the altar.
03007003 All its fat shall be offered: the fat tail and the fat that covers the internal organs,
03007004 both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver, which is to be removed with the kidneys.
03007005 The priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering presented to the Lord. It is a guilt offering.
03007006 Any male in a priest’s family may eat it, but it must be eaten in the sanctuary area; it is most holy.
03007007 “ ‘The same law applies to both the sin offering and the guilt offering: They belong to the priest who makes atonement with them.
03007008 The priest who offers a burnt offering for anyone may keep its hide for himself.
03007009 Every grain offering baked in an oven or cooked in a pan or on a griddle belongs to the priest who offers it,
03007010 and every grain offering, whether mixed with olive oil or dry, belongs equally to all the sons of Aaron.
03007011 “ ‘These are the regulations for the fellowship offering anyone may present to the Lord:
03007012 “ ‘If they offer it as an expression of thankfulness, then along with this thank offering they are to offer thick loaves made without yeast and with olive oil mixed in, thin loaves made without yeast and brushed with oil, and thick loaves of the finest flour well-kneaded and with oil mixed in.
03007013 Along with their fellowship offering of thanksgiving they are to present an offering with thick loaves of bread made with yeast.
03007014 They are to bring one of each kind as an offering, a contribution to the Lord; it belongs to the priest who splashes the blood of the fellowship offering against the altar.
03007015 The meat of their fellowship offering of thanksgiving must be eaten on the day it is offered; they must leave none of it till morning.
03007016 “ ‘If, however, their offering is the result of a vow or is a freewill offering, the sacrifice shall be eaten on the day they offer it, but anything left over may be eaten on the next day.
03007017 Any meat of the sacrifice left over till the third day must be burned up.
03007018 If any meat of the fellowship offering is eaten on the third day, the one who offered it will not be accepted. It will not be reckoned to their credit, for it has become impure; the person who eats any of it will be held responsible.
03007019 “ ‘Meat that touches anything ceremonially unclean must not be eaten; it must be burned up. As for other meat, anyone ceremonially clean may eat it.
03007020 But if anyone who is unclean eats any meat of the fellowship offering belonging to the Lord, they must be cut off from their people.
03007021 Anyone who touches something unclean—whether human uncleanness or an unclean animal or any unclean creature that moves along the ground —and then eats any of the meat of the fellowship offering belonging to the Lord must be cut off from their people.’ ”
03007022 The Lord said to Moses,
03007023 “Say to the Israelites: ‘Do not eat any of the fat of cattle, sheep or goats.
03007024 The fat of an animal found dead or torn by wild animals may be used for any other purpose, but you must not eat it.
03007025 Anyone who eats the fat of an animal from which a food offering may be presented to the Lord must be cut off from their people.
03007026 And wherever you live, you must not eat the blood of any bird or animal.
03007027 Anyone who eats blood must be cut off from their people.’ ”
03007028 The Lord said to Moses,
03007029 “Say to the Israelites: ‘Anyone who brings a fellowship offering to the Lord is to bring part of it as their sacrifice to the Lord.
03007030 With their own hands they are to present the food offering to the Lord; they are to bring the fat, together with the breast, and wave the breast before the Lord as a wave offering.
03007031 The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons.
03007032 You are to give the right thigh of your fellowship offerings to the priest as a contribution.
03007033 The son of Aaron who offers the blood and the fat of the fellowship offering shall have the right thigh as his share.
03007034 From the fellowship offerings of the Israelites, I have taken the breast that is waved and the thigh that is presented and have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons as their perpetual share from the Israelites.’ ”
03007035 This is the portion of the food offerings presented to the Lord that were allotted to Aaron and his sons on the day they were presented to serve the Lord as priests.
03007036 On the day they were anointed, the Lord commanded that the Israelites give this to them as their perpetual share for the generations to come.
03007037 These, then, are the regulations for the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the ordination offering and the fellowship offering,
03007038 which the Lord gave Moses at Mount Sinai in the Desert of Sinai on the day he commanded the Israelites to bring their offerings to the Lord.
03008001 The Lord said to Moses,
03008002 “Bring Aaron and his sons, their garments, the anointing oil, the bull for the sin offering, the two rams and the basket containing bread made without yeast,
03008003 and gather the entire assembly at the entrance to the tent of meeting.”
03008004 Moses did as the Lord commanded him, and the assembly gathered at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
03008005 Moses said to the assembly, “This is what the Lord has commanded to be done.”
03008006 Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water.
03008007 He put the tunic on Aaron, tied the sash around him, clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him. He also fastened the ephod with a decorative waistband, which he tied around him.
03008008 He placed the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece.
03008009 Then he placed the turban on Aaron’s head and set the gold plate, the sacred emblem, on the front of it, as the Lord commanded Moses.
03008010 Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it, and so consecrated them.
03008011 He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times, anointing the altar and all its utensils and the basin with its stand, to consecrate them.
03008012 He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him to consecrate him.
03008013 Then he brought Aaron’s sons forward, put tunics on them, tied sashes around them and fastened caps on them, as the Lord commanded Moses.
03008014 He then presented the bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
03008015 Moses slaughtered the bull and took some of the blood, and with his finger he put it on all the horns of the altar to purify the altar. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. So he consecrated it to make atonement for it.
03008016 Moses also took all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, and both kidneys and their fat, and burned it on the altar.
03008017 But the bull with its hide and its flesh and its intestines he burned up outside the camp, as the Lord commanded Moses.
03008018 He then presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
03008019 Then Moses slaughtered the ram and splashed the blood against the sides of the altar.
03008020 He cut the ram into pieces and burned the head, the pieces and the fat.
03008021 He washed the internal organs and the legs with water and burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.
03008022 He then presented the other ram, the ram for the ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
03008023 Moses slaughtered the ram and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
03008024 Moses also brought Aaron’s sons forward and put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. Then he splashed blood against the sides of the altar.
03008025 After that, he took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, both kidneys and their fat and the right thigh.
03008026 And from the basket of bread made without yeast, which was before the Lord, he took one thick loaf, one thick loaf with olive oil mixed in, and one thin loaf, and he put these on the fat portions and on the right thigh.
03008027 He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and they waved them before the Lord as a wave offering.
03008028 Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar on top of the burnt offering as an ordination offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the Lord.
03008029 Moses also took the breast, which was his share of the ordination ram, and waved it before the Lord as a wave offering, as the Lord commanded Moses.
03008030 Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood from the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and their garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments and his sons and their garments.
03008031 Moses then said to Aaron and his sons, “Cook the meat at the entrance to the tent of meeting and eat it there with the bread from the basket of ordination offerings, as I was commanded: ‘Aaron and his sons are to eat it.’
03008032 Then burn up the rest of the meat and the bread.
03008033 Do not leave the entrance to the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, for your ordination will last seven days.
03008034 What has been done today was commanded by the Lord to make atonement for you.
03008035 You must stay at the entrance to the tent of meeting day and night for seven days and do what the Lord requires, so you will not die; for that is what I have been commanded.”
03008036 So Aaron and his sons did everything the Lord commanded through Moses.
03009001 On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel.
03009002 He said to Aaron, “Take a bull calf for your sin offering and a ram for your burnt offering, both without defect, and present them before the Lord.
03009003 Then say to the Israelites: ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, a calf and a lamb—both a year old and without defect—for a burnt offering,
03009004 and an ox and a ram for a fellowship offering to sacrifice before the Lord, together with a grain offering mixed with olive oil. For today the Lord will appear to you.’ ”
03009005 They took the things Moses commanded to the front of the tent of meeting, and the entire assembly came near and stood before the Lord.
03009006 Then Moses said, “This is what the Lord has commanded you to do, so that the glory of the Lord may appear to you.”
03009007 Moses said to Aaron, “Come to the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and the people; sacrifice the offering that is for the people and make atonement for them, as the Lord has commanded.”
03009008 So Aaron came to the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself.
03009009 His sons brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger into the blood and put it on the horns of the altar; the rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar.
03009010 On the altar he burned the fat, the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering, as the Lord commanded Moses;
03009011 the flesh and the hide he burned up outside the camp.
03009012 Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. His sons handed him the blood, and he splashed it against the sides of the altar.
03009013 They handed him the burnt offering piece by piece, including the head, and he burned them on the altar.
03009014 He washed the internal organs and the legs and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar.
03009015 Aaron then brought the offering that was for the people. He took the goat for the people’s sin offering and slaughtered it and offered it for a sin offering as he did with the first one.
03009016 He brought the burnt offering and offered it in the prescribed way.
03009017 He also brought the grain offering, took a handful of it and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning’s burnt offering.
03009018 He slaughtered the ox and the ram as the fellowship offering for the people. His sons handed him the blood, and he splashed it against the sides of the altar.
03009019 But the fat portions of the ox and the ram—the fat tail, the layer of fat, the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver—
03009020 these they laid on the breasts, and then Aaron burned the fat on the altar.
03009021 Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh before the Lord as a wave offering, as Moses commanded.
03009022 Then Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them. And having sacrificed the sin offering, the burnt offering and the fellowship offering, he stepped down.
03009023 Moses and Aaron then went into the tent of meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people; and the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people.
03009024 Fire came out from the presence of the Lord and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And when all the people saw it, they shouted for joy and fell facedown.
03010001 Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers, put fire in them and added incense; and they offered unauthorized fire before the Lord, contrary to his command.
03010002 So fire came out from the presence of the Lord and consumed them, and they died before the Lord.
03010003 Moses then said to Aaron, “This is what the Lord spoke of when he said: “ ‘Among those who approach me I will be proved holy; in the sight of all the people I will be honored.’ ” Aaron remained silent.
03010004 Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and said to them, “Come here; carry your cousins outside the camp, away from the front of the sanctuary.”
03010005 So they came and carried them, still in their tunics, outside the camp, as Moses ordered.
03010006 Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not let your hair become unkempt and do not tear your clothes, or you will die and the Lord will be angry with the whole community. But your relatives, all the Israelites, may mourn for those the Lord has destroyed by fire.
03010007 Do not leave the entrance to the tent of meeting or you will die, because the Lord’s anointing oil is on you.” So they did as Moses said.
03010008 Then the Lord said to Aaron,
03010009 “You and your sons are not to drink wine or other fermented drink whenever you go into the tent of meeting, or you will die. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come,
03010010 so that you can distinguish between the holy and the common, between the unclean and the clean,
03010011 and so you can teach the Israelites all the decrees the Lord has given them through Moses.”
03010012 Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take the grain offering left over from the food offerings prepared without yeast and presented to the Lord and eat it beside the altar, for it is most holy.
03010013 Eat it in the sanctuary area, because it is your share and your sons’ share of the food offerings presented to the Lord; for so I have been commanded.
03010014 But you and your sons and your daughters may eat the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented. Eat them in a ceremonially clean place; they have been given to you and your children as your share of the Israelites’ fellowship offerings.
03010015 The thigh that was presented and the breast that was waved must be brought with the fat portions of the food offerings, to be waved before the Lord as a wave offering. This will be the perpetual share for you and your children, as the Lord has commanded.”
03010016 When Moses inquired about the goat of the sin offering and found that it had been burned up, he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s remaining sons, and asked,
03010017 “Why didn’t you eat the sin offering in the sanctuary area? It is most holy; it was given to you to take away the guilt of the community by making atonement for them before the Lord.
03010018 Since its blood was not taken into the Holy Place, you should have eaten the goat in the sanctuary area, as I commanded.”
03010019 Aaron replied to Moses, “Today they sacrificed their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord, but such things as this have happened to me. Would the Lord have been pleased if I had eaten the sin offering today?”
03010020 When Moses heard this, he was satisfied.
03011001 The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
03011002 “Say to the Israelites: ‘Of all the animals that live on land, these are the ones you may eat:
03011003 You may eat any animal that has a divided hoof and that chews the cud.
03011004 “ ‘There are some that only chew the cud or only have a divided hoof, but you must not eat them. The camel, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is ceremonially unclean for you.
03011005 The hyrax, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean for you.
03011006 The rabbit, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean for you.
03011007 And the pig, though it has a divided hoof, does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you.
03011008 You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses; they are unclean for you.
03011009 “ ‘Of all the creatures living in the water of the seas and the streams you may eat any that have fins and scales.
03011010 But all creatures in the seas or streams that do not have fins and scales—whether among all the swarming things or among all the other living creatures in the water—you are to regard as unclean.
03011011 And since you are to regard them as unclean, you must not eat their meat; you must regard their carcasses as unclean.
03011012 Anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales is to be regarded as unclean by you.
03011013 “ ‘These are the birds you are to regard as unclean and not eat because they are unclean: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture,
03011014 the red kite, any kind of black kite,
03011015 any kind of raven,
03011016 the horned owl, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk,
03011017 the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl,
03011018 the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey,
03011019 the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe and the bat.
03011020 “ ‘All flying insects that walk on all fours are to be regarded as unclean by you.
03011021 There are, however, some flying insects that walk on all fours that you may eat: those that have jointed legs for hopping on the ground.
03011022 Of these you may eat any kind of locust, katydid, cricket or grasshopper.
03011023 But all other flying insects that have four legs you are to regard as unclean.
03011024 “ ‘You will make yourselves unclean by these; whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean till evening.
03011025 Whoever picks up one of their carcasses must wash their clothes, and they will be unclean till evening.
03011026 “ ‘Every animal that does not have a divided hoof or that does not chew the cud is unclean for you; whoever touches the carcass of any of them will be unclean.
03011027 Of all the animals that walk on all fours, those that walk on their paws are unclean for you; whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean till evening.
03011028 Anyone who picks up their carcasses must wash their clothes, and they will be unclean till evening. These animals are unclean for you.
03011029 “ ‘Of the animals that move along the ground, these are unclean for you: the weasel, the rat, any kind of great lizard,
03011030 the gecko, the monitor lizard, the wall lizard, the skink and the chameleon.
03011031 Of all those that move along the ground, these are unclean for you. Whoever touches them when they are dead will be unclean till evening.
03011032 When one of them dies and falls on something, that article, whatever its use, will be unclean, whether it is made of wood, cloth, hide or sackcloth. Put it in water; it will be unclean till evening, and then it will be clean.
03011033 If one of them falls into a clay pot, everything in it will be unclean, and you must break the pot.
03011034 Any food you are allowed to eat that has come into contact with water from any such pot is unclean, and any liquid that is drunk from such a pot is unclean.
03011035 Anything that one of their carcasses falls on becomes unclean; an oven or cooking pot must be broken up. They are unclean, and you are to regard them as unclean.
03011036 A spring, however, or a cistern for collecting water remains clean, but anyone who touches one of these carcasses is unclean.
03011037 If a carcass falls on any seeds that are to be planted, they remain clean.
03011038 But if water has been put on the seed and a carcass falls on it, it is unclean for you.
03011039 “ ‘If an animal that you are allowed to eat dies, anyone who touches its carcass will be unclean till evening.
03011040 Anyone who eats some of its carcass must wash their clothes, and they will be unclean till evening. Anyone who picks up the carcass must wash their clothes, and they will be unclean till evening.
03011041 “ ‘Every creature that moves along the ground is to be regarded as unclean; it is not to be eaten.
03011042 You are not to eat any creature that moves along the ground, whether it moves on its belly or walks on all fours or on many feet; it is unclean.
03011043 Do not defile yourselves by any of these creatures. Do not make yourselves unclean by means of them or be made unclean by them.
03011044 I am the Lord your God; consecrate yourselves and be holy, because I am holy. Do not make yourselves unclean by any creature that moves along the ground.
03011045 I am the Lord, who brought you up out of Egypt to be your God; therefore be holy, because I am holy.
03011046 “ ‘These are the regulations concerning animals, birds, every living thing that moves about in the water and every creature that moves along the ground.
03011047 You must distinguish between the unclean and the clean, between living creatures that may be eaten and those that may not be eaten.’ ”
03012001 The Lord said to Moses,
03012002 “Say to the Israelites: ‘A woman who becomes pregnant and gives birth to a son will be ceremonially unclean for seven days, just as she is unclean during her monthly period.
03012003 On the eighth day the boy is to be circumcised.
03012004 Then the woman must wait thirty-three days to be purified from her bleeding. She must not touch anything sacred or go to the sanctuary until the days of her purification are over.
03012005 If she gives birth to a daughter, for two weeks the woman will be unclean, as during her period. Then she must wait sixty-six days to be purified from her bleeding.
03012006 “ ‘When the days of her purification for a son or daughter are over, she is to bring to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting a year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a dove for a sin offering.
03012007 He shall offer them before the Lord to make atonement for her, and then she will be ceremonially clean from her flow of blood. “ ‘These are the regulations for the woman who gives birth to a boy or a girl.
03012008 But if she cannot afford a lamb, she is to bring two doves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for her, and she will be clean.’ ”
03013001 The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
03013002 “When anyone has a swelling or a rash or a shiny spot on their skin that may be a defiling skin disease, they must be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons who is a priest.
03013003 The priest is to examine the sore on the skin, and if the hair in the sore has turned white and the sore appears to be more than skin deep, it is a defiling skin disease. When the priest examines that person, he shall pronounce them ceremonially unclean.
03013004 If the shiny spot on the skin is white but does not appear to be more than skin deep and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest is to isolate the affected person for seven days.
03013005 On the seventh day the priest is to examine them, and if he sees that the sore is unchanged and has not spread in the skin, he is to isolate them for another seven days.
03013006 On the seventh day the priest is to examine them again, and if the sore has faded and has not spread in the skin, the priest shall pronounce them clean; it is only a rash. They must wash their clothes, and they will be clean.
03013007 But if the rash does spread in their skin after they have shown themselves to the priest to be pronounced clean, they must appear before the priest again.
03013008 The priest is to examine that person, and if the rash has spread in the skin, he shall pronounce them unclean; it is a defiling skin disease.
03013009 “When anyone has a defiling skin disease, they must be brought to the priest.
03013010 The priest is to examine them, and if there is a white swelling in the skin that has turned the hair white and if there is raw flesh in the swelling,
03013011 it is a chronic skin disease and the priest shall pronounce them unclean. He is not to isolate them, because they are already unclean.
03013012 “If the disease breaks out all over their skin and, so far as the priest can see, it covers all the skin of the affected person from head to foot,
03013013 the priest is to examine them, and if the disease has covered their whole body, he shall pronounce them clean. Since it has all turned white, they are clean.
03013014 But whenever raw flesh appears on them, they will be unclean.
03013015 When the priest sees the raw flesh, he shall pronounce them unclean. The raw flesh is unclean; they have a defiling disease.
03013016 If the raw flesh changes and turns white, they must go to the priest.
03013017 The priest is to examine them, and if the sores have turned white, the priest shall pronounce the affected person clean; then they will be clean.
03013018 “When someone has a boil on their skin and it heals,
03013019 and in the place where the boil was, a white swelling or reddish-white spot appears, they must present themselves to the priest.
03013020 The priest is to examine it, and if it appears to be more than skin deep and the hair in it has turned white, the priest shall pronounce that person unclean. It is a defiling skin disease that has broken out where the boil was.
03013021 But if, when the priest examines it, there is no white hair in it and it is not more than skin deep and has faded, then the priest is to isolate them for seven days.
03013022 If it is spreading in the skin, the priest shall pronounce them unclean; it is a defiling disease.
03013023 But if the spot is unchanged and has not spread, it is only a scar from the boil, and the priest shall pronounce them clean.
03013024 “When someone has a burn on their skin and a reddish-white or white spot appears in the raw flesh of the burn,
03013025 the priest is to examine the spot, and if the hair in it has turned white, and it appears to be more than skin deep, it is a defiling disease that has broken out in the burn. The priest shall pronounce them unclean; it is a defiling skin disease.
03013026 But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in the spot and if it is not more than skin deep and has faded, then the priest is to isolate them for seven days.
03013027 On the seventh day the priest is to examine that person, and if it is spreading in the skin, the priest shall pronounce them unclean; it is a defiling skin disease.
03013028 If, however, the spot is unchanged and has not spread in the skin but has faded, it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce them clean; it is only a scar from the burn.
03013029 “If a man or woman has a sore on their head or chin,
03013030 the priest is to examine the sore, and if it appears to be more than skin deep and the hair in it is yellow and thin, the priest shall pronounce them unclean; it is a defiling skin disease on the head or chin.
03013031 But if, when the priest examines the sore, it does not seem to be more than skin deep and there is no black hair in it, then the priest is to isolate the affected person for seven days.
03013032 On the seventh day the priest is to examine the sore, and if it has not spread and there is no yellow hair in it and it does not appear to be more than skin deep,
03013033 then the man or woman must shave themselves, except for the affected area, and the priest is to keep them isolated another seven days.
03013034 On the seventh day the priest is to examine the sore, and if it has not spread in the skin and appears to be no more than skin deep, the priest shall pronounce them clean. They must wash their clothes, and they will be clean.
03013035 But if the sore does spread in the skin after they are pronounced clean,
03013036 the priest is to examine them, and if he finds that the sore has spread in the skin, he does not need to look for yellow hair; they are unclean.
03013037 If, however, the sore is unchanged so far as the priest can see, and if black hair has grown in it, the affected person is healed. They are clean, and the priest shall pronounce them clean.
03013038 “When a man or woman has white spots on the skin,
03013039 the priest is to examine them, and if the spots are dull white, it is a harmless rash that has broken out on the skin; they are clean.
03013040 “A man who has lost his hair and is bald is clean.
03013041 If he has lost his hair from the front of his scalp and has a bald forehead, he is clean.
03013042 But if he has a reddish-white sore on his bald head or forehead, it is a defiling disease breaking out on his head or forehead.
03013043 The priest is to examine him, and if the swollen sore on his head or forehead is reddish-white like a defiling skin disease,
03013044 the man is diseased and is unclean. The priest shall pronounce him unclean because of the sore on his head.
03013045 “Anyone with such a defiling disease must wear torn clothes, let their hair be unkempt, cover the lower part of their face and cry out, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’
03013046 As long as they have the disease they remain unclean. They must live alone; they must live outside the camp.
03013047 “As for any fabric that is spoiled with a defiling mold—any woolen or linen clothing,
03013048 any woven or knitted material of linen or wool, any leather or anything made of leather—
03013049 if the affected area in the fabric, the leather, the woven or knitted material, or any leather article, is greenish or reddish, it is a defiling mold and must be shown to the priest.
03013050 The priest is to examine the affected area and isolate the article for seven days.
03013051 On the seventh day he is to examine it, and if the mold has spread in the fabric, the woven or knitted material, or the leather, whatever its use, it is a persistent defiling mold; the article is unclean.
03013052 He must burn the fabric, the woven or knitted material of wool or linen, or any leather article that has been spoiled; because the defiling mold is persistent, the article must be burned.
03013053 “But if, when the priest examines it, the mold has not spread in the fabric, the woven or knitted material, or the leather article,
03013054 he shall order that the spoiled article be washed. Then he is to isolate it for another seven days.
03013055 After the article has been washed, the priest is to examine it again, and if the mold has not changed its appearance, even though it has not spread, it is unclean. Burn it, no matter which side of the fabric has been spoiled.
03013056 If, when the priest examines it, the mold has faded after the article has been washed, he is to tear the spoiled part out of the fabric, the leather, or the woven or knitted material.
03013057 But if it reappears in the fabric, in the woven or knitted material, or in the leather article, it is a spreading mold; whatever has the mold must be burned.
03013058 Any fabric, woven or knitted material, or any leather article that has been washed and is rid of the mold, must be washed again. Then it will be clean.”
03013059 These are the regulations concerning defiling molds in woolen or linen clothing, woven or knitted material, or any leather article, for pronouncing them clean or unclean.
03014001 The Lord said to Moses,
03014002 “These are the regulations for any diseased person at the time of their ceremonial cleansing, when they are brought to the priest:
03014003 The priest is to go outside the camp and examine them. If they have been healed of their defiling skin disease,
03014004 the priest shall order that two live clean birds and some cedar wood, scarlet yarn and hyssop be brought for the person to be cleansed.
03014005 Then the priest shall order that one of the birds be killed over fresh water in a clay pot.
03014006 He is then to take the live bird and dip it, together with the cedar wood, the scarlet yarn and the hyssop, into the blood of the bird that was killed over the fresh water.
03014007 Seven times he shall sprinkle the one to be cleansed of the defiling disease, and then pronounce them clean. After that, he is to release the live bird in the open fields.
03014008 “The person to be cleansed must wash their clothes, shave off all their hair and bathe with water; then they will be ceremonially clean. After this they may come into the camp, but they must stay outside their tent for seven days.
03014009 On the seventh day they must shave off all their hair; they must shave their head, their beard, their eyebrows and the rest of their hair. They must wash their clothes and bathe themselves with water, and they will be clean.
03014010 “On the eighth day they must bring two male lambs and one ewe lamb a year old, each without defect, along with three-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering, and one log of oil.
03014011 The priest who pronounces them clean shall present both the one to be cleansed and their offerings before the Lord at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
03014012 “Then the priest is to take one of the male lambs and offer it as a guilt offering, along with the log of oil; he shall wave them before the Lord as a wave offering.
03014013 He is to slaughter the lamb in the sanctuary area where the sin offering and the burnt offering are slaughtered. Like the sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to the priest; it is most holy.
03014014 The priest is to take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot.
03014015 The priest shall then take some of the log of oil, pour it in the palm of his own left hand,
03014016 dip his right forefinger into the oil in his palm, and with his finger sprinkle some of it before the Lord seven times.
03014017 The priest is to put some of the oil remaining in his palm on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot, on top of the blood of the guilt offering.
03014018 The rest of the oil in his palm the priest shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed and make atonement for them before the Lord.
03014019 “Then the priest is to sacrifice the sin offering and make atonement for the one to be cleansed from their uncleanness. After that, the priest shall slaughter the burnt offering
03014020 and offer it on the altar, together with the grain offering, and make atonement for them, and they will be clean.
03014021 “If, however, they are poor and cannot afford these, they must take one male lamb as a guilt offering to be waved to make atonement for them, together with a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering, a log of oil,
03014022 and two doves or two young pigeons, such as they can afford, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.
03014023 “On the eighth day they must bring them for their cleansing to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting, before the Lord.
03014024 The priest is to take the lamb for the guilt offering, together with the log of oil, and wave them before the Lord as a wave offering.
03014025 He shall slaughter the lamb for the guilt offering and take some of its blood and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot.
03014026 The priest is to pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand,
03014027 and with his right forefinger sprinkle some of the oil from his palm seven times before the Lord.
03014028 Some of the oil in his palm he is to put on the same places he put the blood of the guilt offering—on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot.
03014029 The rest of the oil in his palm the priest shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed, to make atonement for them before the Lord.
03014030 Then he shall sacrifice the doves or the young pigeons, such as the person can afford,
03014031 one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, together with the grain offering. In this way the priest will make atonement before the Lord on behalf of the one to be cleansed.”
03014032 These are the regulations for anyone who has a defiling skin disease and who cannot afford the regular offerings for their cleansing.
03014033 The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
03014034 “When you enter the land of Canaan, which I am giving you as your possession, and I put a spreading mold in a house in that land,
03014035 the owner of the house must go and tell the priest, ‘I have seen something that looks like a defiling mold in my house.’
03014036 The priest is to order the house to be emptied before he goes in to examine the mold, so that nothing in the house will be pronounced unclean. After this the priest is to go in and inspect the house.
03014037 He is to examine the mold on the walls, and if it has greenish or reddish depressions that appear to be deeper than the surface of the wall,
03014038 the priest shall go out the doorway of the house and close it up for seven days.
03014039 On the seventh day the priest shall return to inspect the house. If the mold has spread on the walls,
03014040 he is to order that the contaminated stones be torn out and thrown into an unclean place outside the town.
03014041 He must have all the inside walls of the house scraped and the material that is scraped off dumped into an unclean place outside the town.
03014042 Then they are to take other stones to replace these and take new clay and plaster the house.
03014043 “If the defiling mold reappears in the house after the stones have been torn out and the house scraped and plastered,
03014044 the priest is to go and examine it and, if the mold has spread in the house, it is a persistent defiling mold; the house is unclean.
03014045 It must be torn down—its stones, timbers and all the plaster—and taken out of the town to an unclean place.
03014046 “Anyone who goes into the house while it is closed up will be unclean till evening.
03014047 Anyone who sleeps or eats in the house must wash their clothes.
03014048 “But if the priest comes to examine it and the mold has not spread after the house has been plastered, he shall pronounce the house clean, because the defiling mold is gone.
03014049 To purify the house he is to take two birds and some cedar wood, scarlet yarn and hyssop.
03014050 He shall kill one of the birds over fresh water in a clay pot.
03014051 Then he is to take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet yarn and the live bird, dip them into the blood of the dead bird and the fresh water, and sprinkle the house seven times.
03014052 He shall purify the house with the bird’s blood, the fresh water, the live bird, the cedar wood, the hyssop and the scarlet yarn.
03014053 Then he is to release the live bird in the open fields outside the town. In this way he will make atonement for the house, and it will be clean.”
03014054 These are the regulations for any defiling skin disease, for a sore,
03014055 for defiling molds in fabric or in a house,
03014056 and for a swelling, a rash or a shiny spot,
03014057 to determine when something is clean or unclean. These are the regulations for defiling skin diseases and defiling molds.
03015001 The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
03015002 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When any man has an unusual bodily discharge, such a discharge is unclean.
03015003 Whether it continues flowing from his body or is blocked, it will make him unclean. This is how his discharge will bring about uncleanness:
03015004 “ ‘Any bed the man with a discharge lies on will be unclean, and anything he sits on will be unclean.
03015005 Anyone who touches his bed must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening.
03015006 Whoever sits on anything that the man with a discharge sat on must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening.
03015007 “ ‘Whoever touches the man who has a discharge must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening.
03015008 “ ‘If the man with the discharge spits on anyone who is clean, they must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening.
03015009 “ ‘Everything the man sits on when riding will be unclean,
03015010 and whoever touches any of the things that were under him will be unclean till evening; whoever picks up those things must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening.
03015011 “ ‘Anyone the man with a discharge touches without rinsing his hands with water must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening.
03015012 “ ‘A clay pot that the man touches must be broken, and any wooden article is to be rinsed with water.
03015013 “ ‘When a man is cleansed from his discharge, he is to count off seven days for his ceremonial cleansing; he must wash his clothes and bathe himself with fresh water, and he will be clean.
03015014 On the eighth day he must take two doves or two young pigeons and come before the Lord to the entrance to the tent of meeting and give them to the priest.
03015015 The priest is to sacrifice them, the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. In this way he will make atonement before the Lord for the man because of his discharge.
03015016 “ ‘When a man has an emission of semen, he must bathe his whole body with water, and he will be unclean till evening.
03015017 Any clothing or leather that has semen on it must be washed with water, and it will be unclean till evening.
03015018 When a man has sexual relations with a woman and there is an emission of semen, both of them must bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening.
03015019 “ ‘When a woman has her regular flow of blood, the impurity of her monthly period will last seven days, and anyone who touches her will be unclean till evening.
03015020 “ ‘Anything she lies on during her period will be unclean, and anything she sits on will be unclean.
03015021 Anyone who touches her bed will be unclean; they must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening.
03015022 Anyone who touches anything she sits on will be unclean; they must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening.
03015023 Whether it is the bed or anything she was sitting on, when anyone touches it, they will be unclean till evening.
03015024 “ ‘If a man has sexual relations with her and her monthly flow touches him, he will be unclean for seven days; any bed he lies on will be unclean.
03015025 “ ‘When a woman has a discharge of blood for many days at a time other than her monthly period or has a discharge that continues beyond her period, she will be unclean as long as she has the discharge, just as in the days of her period.
03015026 Any bed she lies on while her discharge continues will be unclean, as is her bed during her monthly period, and anything she sits on will be unclean, as during her period.
03015027 Anyone who touches them will be unclean; they must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening.
03015028 “ ‘When she is cleansed from her discharge, she must count off seven days, and after that she will be ceremonially clean.
03015029 On the eighth day she must take two doves or two young pigeons and bring them to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
03015030 The priest is to sacrifice one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. In this way he will make atonement for her before the Lord for the uncleanness of her discharge.
03015031 “ ‘You must keep the Israelites separate from things that make them unclean, so they will not die in their uncleanness for defiling my dwelling place, which is among them.’ ”
03015032 These are the regulations for a man with a discharge, for anyone made unclean by an emission of semen,
03015033 for a woman in her monthly period, for a man or a woman with a discharge, and for a man who has sexual relations with a woman who is ceremonially unclean.
03016001 The Lord spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron who died when they approached the Lord.
03016002 The Lord said to Moses: “Tell your brother Aaron that he is not to come whenever he chooses into the Most Holy Place behind the curtain in front of the atonement cover on the ark, or else he will die. For I will appear in the cloud over the atonement cover.
03016003 “This is how Aaron is to enter the Most Holy Place: He must first bring a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
03016004 He is to put on the sacred linen tunic, with linen undergarments next to his body; he is to tie the linen sash around him and put on the linen turban. These are sacred garments; so he must bathe himself with water before he puts them on.
03016005 From the Israelite community he is to take two male goats for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
03016006 “Aaron is to offer the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household.
03016007 Then he is to take the two goats and present them before the Lord at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
03016008 He is to cast lots for the two goats—one lot for the Lord and the other for the scapegoat.
03016009 Aaron shall bring the goat whose lot falls to the Lord and sacrifice it for a sin offering.
03016010 But the goat chosen by lot as the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the Lord to be used for making atonement by sending it into the wilderness as a scapegoat.
03016011 “Aaron shall bring the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household, and he is to slaughter the bull for his own sin offering.
03016012 He is to take a censer full of burning coals from the altar before the Lord and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense and take them behind the curtain.
03016013 He is to put the incense on the fire before the Lord, and the smoke of the incense will conceal the atonement cover above the tablets of the covenant law, so that he will not die.
03016014 He is to take some of the bull’s blood and with his finger sprinkle it on the front of the atonement cover; then he shall sprinkle some of it with his finger seven times before the atonement cover.
03016015 “He shall then slaughter the goat for the sin offering for the people and take its blood behind the curtain and do with it as he did with the bull’s blood: He shall sprinkle it on the atonement cover and in front of it.
03016016 In this way he will make atonement for the Most Holy Place because of the uncleanness and rebellion of the Israelites, whatever their sins have been. He is to do the same for the tent of meeting, which is among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
03016017 No one is to be in the tent of meeting from the time Aaron goes in to make atonement in the Most Holy Place until he comes out, having made atonement for himself, his household and the whole community of Israel.
03016018 “Then he shall come out to the altar that is before the Lord and make atonement for it. He shall take some of the bull’s blood and some of the goat’s blood and put it on all the horns of the altar.
03016019 He shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times to cleanse it and to consecrate it from the uncleanness of the Israelites.
03016020 “When Aaron has finished making atonement for the Most Holy Place, the tent of meeting and the altar, he shall bring forward the live goat.
03016021 He is to lay both hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the wickedness and rebellion of the Israelites—all their sins—and put them on the goat’s head. He shall send the goat away into the wilderness in the care of someone appointed for the task.
03016022 The goat will carry on itself all their sins to a remote place; and the man shall release it in the wilderness.
03016023 “Then Aaron is to go into the tent of meeting and take off the linen garments he put on before he entered the Most Holy Place, and he is to leave them there.
03016024 He shall bathe himself with water in the sanctuary area and put on his regular garments. Then he shall come out and sacrifice the burnt offering for himself and the burnt offering for the people, to make atonement for himself and for the people.
03016025 He shall also burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar.
03016026 “The man who releases the goat as a scapegoat must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; afterward he may come into the camp.
03016027 The bull and the goat for the sin offerings, whose blood was brought into the Most Holy Place to make atonement, must be taken outside the camp; their hides, flesh and intestines are to be burned up.
03016028 The man who burns them must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; afterward he may come into the camp.
03016029 “This is to be a lasting ordinance for you: On the tenth day of the seventh month you must deny yourselves and not do any work—whether native-born or a foreigner residing among you—
03016030 because on this day atonement will be made for you, to cleanse you. Then, before the Lord, you will be clean from all your sins.
03016031 It is a day of sabbath rest, and you must deny yourselves; it is a lasting ordinance.
03016032 The priest who is anointed and ordained to succeed his father as high priest is to make atonement. He is to put on the sacred linen garments
03016033 and make atonement for the Most Holy Place, for the tent of meeting and the altar, and for the priests and all the members of the community.
03016034 “This is to be a lasting ordinance for you: Atonement is to be made once a year for all the sins of the Israelites.” And it was done, as the Lord commanded Moses.
03017001 The Lord said to Moses,
03017002 “Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites and say to them: ‘This is what the Lord has commanded:
03017003 Any Israelite who sacrifices an ox, a lamb or a goat in the camp or outside of it
03017004 instead of bringing it to the entrance to the tent of meeting to present it as an offering to the Lord in front of the tabernacle of the Lord—that person shall be considered guilty of bloodshed; they have shed blood and must be cut off from their people.
03017005 This is so the Israelites will bring to the Lord the sacrifices they are now making in the open fields. They must bring them to the priest, that is, to the Lord, at the entrance to the tent of meeting and sacrifice them as fellowship offerings.
03017006 The priest is to splash the blood against the altar of the Lord at the entrance to the tent of meeting and burn the fat as an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
03017007 They must no longer offer any of their sacrifices to the goat idols to whom they prostitute themselves. This is to be a lasting ordinance for them and for the generations to come.’
03017008 “Say to them: ‘Any Israelite or any foreigner residing among them who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice
03017009 and does not bring it to the entrance to the tent of meeting to sacrifice it to the Lord must be cut off from the people of Israel.
03017010 “ ‘I will set my face against any Israelite or any foreigner residing among them who eats blood, and I will cut them off from the people.
03017011 For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one’s life.
03017012 Therefore I say to the Israelites, “None of you may eat blood, nor may any foreigner residing among you eat blood.”
03017013 “ ‘Any Israelite or any foreigner residing among you who hunts any animal or bird that may be eaten must drain out the blood and cover it with earth,
03017014 because the life of every creature is its blood. That is why I have said to the Israelites, “You must not eat the blood of any creature, because the life of every creature is its blood; anyone who eats it must be cut off.”
03017015 “ ‘Anyone, whether native-born or foreigner, who eats anything found dead or torn by wild animals must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be ceremonially unclean till evening; then they will be clean.
03017016 But if they do not wash their clothes and bathe themselves, they will be held responsible.’ ”
03018001 The Lord said to Moses,
03018002 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘I am the Lord your God.
03018003 You must not do as they do in Egypt, where you used to live, and you must not do as they do in the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you. Do not follow their practices.
03018004 You must obey my laws and be careful to follow my decrees. I am the Lord your God.
03018005 Keep my decrees and laws, for the person who obeys them will live by them. I am the Lord.
03018006 “ ‘No one is to approach any close relative to have sexual relations. I am the Lord.
03018007 “ ‘Do not dishonor your father by having sexual relations with your mother. She is your mother; do not have relations with her.
03018008 “ ‘Do not have sexual relations with your father’s wife; that would dishonor your father.
03018009 “ ‘Do not have sexual relations with your sister, either your father’s daughter or your mother’s daughter, whether she was born in the same home or elsewhere.
03018010 “ ‘Do not have sexual relations with your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter; that would dishonor you.
03018011 “ ‘Do not have sexual relations with the daughter of your father’s wife, born to your father; she is your sister.
03018012 “ ‘Do not have sexual relations with your father’s sister; she is your father’s close relative.
03018013 “ ‘Do not have sexual relations with your mother’s sister, because she is your mother’s close relative.
03018014 “ ‘Do not dishonor your father’s brother by approaching his wife to have sexual relations; she is your aunt.
03018015 “ ‘Do not have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law. She is your son’s wife; do not have relations with her.
03018016 “ ‘Do not have sexual relations with your brother’s wife; that would dishonor your brother.
03018017 “ ‘Do not have sexual relations with both a woman and her daughter. Do not have sexual relations with either her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter; they are her close relatives. That is wickedness.
03018018 “ ‘Do not take your wife’s sister as a rival wife and have sexual relations with her while your wife is living.
03018019 “ ‘Do not approach a woman to have sexual relations during the uncleanness of her monthly period.
03018020 “ ‘Do not have sexual relations with your neighbor’s wife and defile yourself with her.
03018021 “ ‘Do not give any of your children to be sacrificed to Molek, for you must not profane the name of your God. I am the Lord.
03018022 “ ‘Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable.
03018023 “ ‘Do not have sexual relations with an animal and defile yourself with it. A woman must not present herself to an animal to have sexual relations with it; that is a perversion.
03018024 “ ‘Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, because this is how the nations that I am going to drive out before you became defiled.
03018025 Even the land was defiled; so I punished it for its sin, and the land vomited out its inhabitants.
03018026 But you must keep my decrees and my laws. The native-born and the foreigners residing among you must not do any of these detestable things,
03018027 for all these things were done by the people who lived in the land before you, and the land became defiled.
03018028 And if you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it vomited out the nations that were before you.
03018029 “ ‘Everyone who does any of these detestable things—such persons must be cut off from their people.
03018030 Keep my requirements and do not follow any of the detestable customs that were practiced before you came and do not defile yourselves with them. I am the Lord your God.’ ”
03019001 The Lord said to Moses,
03019002 “Speak to the entire assembly of Israel and say to them: ‘Be holy because I, the Lord your God, am holy.
03019003 “ ‘Each of you must respect your mother and father, and you must observe my Sabbaths. I am the Lord your God.
03019004 “ ‘Do not turn to idols or make metal gods for yourselves. I am the Lord your God.
03019005 “ ‘When you sacrifice a fellowship offering to the Lord, sacrifice it in such a way that it will be accepted on your behalf.
03019006 It shall be eaten on the day you sacrifice it or on the next day; anything left over until the third day must be burned up.
03019007 If any of it is eaten on the third day, it is impure and will not be accepted.
03019008 Whoever eats it will be held responsible because they have desecrated what is holy to the Lord; they must be cut off from their people.
03019009 “ ‘When you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap to the very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest.
03019010 Do not go over your vineyard a second time or pick up the grapes that have fallen. Leave them for the poor and the foreigner. I am the Lord your God.

03019021 The man, however, must bring a ram to the entrance to the tent of meeting for a guilt offering to the Lord.
03019022 With the ram of the guilt offering the priest is to make atonement for him before the Lord for the sin he has committed, and his sin will be forgiven.

03020001 The Lord said to Moses,
03020002 “Say to the Israelites: ‘Any Israelite or any foreigner residing in Israel who sacrifices any of his children to Molek is to be put to death. The members of the community are to stone him.
03020003 I myself will set my face against him and will cut him off from his people; for by sacrificing his children to Molek, he has defiled my sanctuary and profaned my holy name.
03020004 If the members of the community close their eyes when that man sacrifices one of his children to Molek and if they fail to put him to death,
03020005 I myself will set my face against him and his family and will cut them off from their people together with all who follow him in prostituting themselves to Molek.
03020006 “ ‘I will set my face against anyone who turns to mediums and spiritists to prostitute themselves by following them, and I will cut them off from their people.

03020010 “ ‘If a man commits adultery with another man’s wife—with the wife of his neighbor—both the adulterer and the adulteress are to be put to death.
03020011 “ ‘If a man has sexual relations with his father’s wife, he has dishonored his father. Both the man and the woman are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.
03020012 “ ‘If a man has sexual relations with his daughter-in-law, both of them are to be put to death. What they have done is a perversion; their blood will be on their own heads.
03020013 “ ‘If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.
03020014 “ ‘If a man marries both a woman and her mother, it is wicked. Both he and they must be burned in the fire, so that no wickedness will be among you.
03020015 “ ‘If a man has sexual relations with an animal, he is to be put to death, and you must kill the animal.
03020016 “ ‘If a woman approaches an animal to have sexual relations with it, kill both the woman and the animal. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.
03020017 “ ‘If a man marries his sister, the daughter of either his father or his mother, and they have sexual relations, it is a disgrace. They are to be publicly removed from their people. He has dishonored his sister and will be held responsible.
03020018 “ ‘If a man has sexual relations with a woman during her monthly period, he has exposed the source of her flow, and she has also uncovered it. Both of them are to be cut off from their people.
03020019 “ ‘Do not have sexual relations with the sister of either your mother or your father, for that would dishonor a close relative; both of you would be held responsible.

03020024 But I said to you, “You will possess their land; I will give it to you as an inheritance, a land flowing with milk and honey.” I am the Lord your God, who has set you apart from the nations.
03020025 “ ‘You must therefore make a distinction between clean and unclean animals and between unclean and clean birds. Do not defile yourselves by any animal or bird or anything that moves along the ground—those that I have set apart as unclean for you.
03020026 You are to be holy to me because I, the Lord, am holy, and I have set you apart from the nations to be my own.
03020027 “ ‘A man or woman who is a medium or spiritist among you must be put to death. You are to stone them; their blood will be on their own heads.’ ”
03021001 The Lord said to Moses, “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them: ‘A priest must not make himself ceremonially unclean for any of his people who die,
03021002 except for a close relative, such as his mother or father, his son or daughter, his brother,
03021003 or an unmarried sister who is dependent on him since she has no husband—for her he may make himself unclean.
03021004 He must not make himself unclean for people related to him by marriage, and so defile himself.
03021005 “ ‘Priests must not shave their heads or shave off the edges of their beards or cut their bodies.
03021006 They must be holy to their God and must not profane the name of their God. Because they present the food offerings to the Lord, the food of their God, they are to be holy.
03021007 “ ‘They must not marry women defiled by prostitution or divorced from their husbands, because priests are holy to their God.
03021008 Regard them as holy, because they offer up the food of your God. Consider them holy, because I the Lord am holy—I who make you holy.
03021009 “ ‘If a priest’s daughter defiles herself by becoming a prostitute, she disgraces her father; she must be burned in the fire.
03021010 “ ‘The high priest, the one among his brothers who has had the anointing oil poured on his head and who has been ordained to wear the priestly garments, must not let his hair become unkempt or tear his clothes.
03021011 He must not enter a place where there is a dead body. He must not make himself unclean, even for his father or mother,
03021012 nor leave the sanctuary of his God or desecrate it, because he has been dedicated by the anointing oil of his God. I am the Lord.
03021013 “ ‘The woman he marries must be a virgin.
03021014 He must not marry a widow, a divorced woman, or a woman defiled by prostitution, but only a virgin from his own people,
03021015 so that he will not defile his offspring among his people. I am the Lord, who makes him holy.’ ”
03021016 The Lord said to Moses,
03021017 “Say to Aaron: ‘For the generations to come none of your descendants who has a defect may come near to offer the food of his God.
03021018 No man who has any defect may come near: no man who is blind or lame, disfigured or deformed;
03021019 no man with a crippled foot or hand,
03021020 or who is a hunchback or a dwarf, or who has any eye defect, or who has festering or running sores or damaged testicles.
03021021 No descendant of Aaron the priest who has any defect is to come near to present the food offerings to the Lord. He has a defect; he must not come near to offer the food of his God.
03021022 He may eat the most holy food of his God, as well as the holy food;
03021023 yet because of his defect, he must not go near the curtain or approach the altar, and so desecrate my sanctuary. I am the Lord, who makes them holy.’ ”
03021024 So Moses told this to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites.
03022001 The Lord said to Moses,
03022002 “Tell Aaron and his sons to treat with respect the sacred offerings the Israelites consecrate to me, so they will not profane my holy name. I am the Lord.
03022003 “Say to them: ‘For the generations to come, if any of your descendants is ceremonially unclean and yet comes near the sacred offerings that the Israelites consecrate to the Lord, that person must be cut off from my presence. I am the Lord.
03022004 “ ‘If a descendant of Aaron has a defiling skin disease or a bodily discharge, he may not eat the sacred offerings until he is cleansed. He will also be unclean if he touches something defiled by a corpse or by anyone who has an emission of semen,
03022005 or if he touches any crawling thing that makes him unclean, or any person who makes him unclean, whatever the uncleanness may be.
03022006 The one who touches any such thing will be unclean till evening. He must not eat any of the sacred offerings unless he has bathed himself with water.
03022007 When the sun goes down, he will be clean, and after that he may eat the sacred offerings, for they are his food.
03022008 He must not eat anything found dead or torn by wild animals, and so become unclean through it. I am the Lord.
03022009 “ ‘The priests are to perform my service in such a way that they do not become guilty and die for treating it with contempt. I am the Lord, who makes them holy.
03022010 “ ‘No one outside a priest’s family may eat the sacred offering, nor may the guest of a priest or his hired worker eat it.
03022011 But if a priest buys a slave with money, or if slaves are born in his household, they may eat his food.
03022012 If a priest’s daughter marries anyone other than a priest, she may not eat any of the sacred contributions.
03022013 But if a priest’s daughter becomes a widow or is divorced, yet has no children, and she returns to live in her father’s household as in her youth, she may eat her father’s food. No unauthorized person, however, may eat it.
03022014 “ ‘Anyone who eats a sacred offering by mistake must make restitution to the priest for the offering and add a fifth of the value to it.
03022015 The priests must not desecrate the sacred offerings the Israelites present to the Lord
03022016 by allowing them to eat the sacred offerings and so bring upon them guilt requiring payment. I am the Lord, who makes them holy.’ ”
03022017 The Lord said to Moses,
03022018 “Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites and say to them: ‘If any of you—whether an Israelite or a foreigner residing in Israel—presents a gift for a burnt offering to the Lord, either to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering,
03022019 you must present a male without defect from the cattle, sheep or goats in order that it may be accepted on your behalf.
03022020 Do not bring anything with a defect, because it will not be accepted on your behalf.
03022021 When anyone brings from the herd or flock a fellowship offering to the Lord to fulfill a special vow or as a freewill offering, it must be without defect or blemish to be acceptable.
03022022 Do not offer to the Lord the blind, the injured or the maimed, or anything with warts or festering or running sores. Do not place any of these on the altar as a food offering presented to the Lord.
03022023 You may, however, present as a freewill offering an ox or a sheep that is deformed or stunted, but it will not be accepted in fulfillment of a vow.
03022024 You must not offer to the Lord an animal whose testicles are bruised, crushed, torn or cut. You must not do this in your own land,
03022025 and you must not accept such animals from the hand of a foreigner and offer them as the food of your God. They will not be accepted on your behalf, because they are deformed and have defects.’ ”
03022026 The Lord said to Moses,
03022027 “When a calf, a lamb or a goat is born, it is to remain with its mother for seven days. From the eighth day on, it will be acceptable as a food offering presented to the Lord.
03022028 Do not slaughter a cow or a sheep and its young on the same day.
03022029 “When you sacrifice a thank offering to the Lord, sacrifice it in such a way that it will be accepted on your behalf.
03022030 It must be eaten that same day; leave none of it till morning. I am the Lord.
03022031 “Keep my commands and follow them. I am the Lord.
03022032 Do not profane my holy name, for I must be acknowledged as holy by the Israelites. I am the Lord, who made you holy
03022033 and who brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am the Lord.”
03023001 The Lord said to Moses,
03023002 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘These are my appointed festivals, the appointed festivals of the Lord, which you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies.
03023003 “ ‘There are six days when you may work, but the seventh day is a day of sabbath rest, a day of sacred assembly. You are not to do any work; wherever you live, it is a sabbath to the Lord.
03023004 “ ‘These are the Lord’s appointed festivals, the sacred assemblies you are to proclaim at their appointed times:
03023005 The Lord’s Passover begins at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month.
03023006 On the fifteenth day of that month the Lord’s Festival of Unleavened Bread begins; for seven days you must eat bread made without yeast.
03023007 On the first day hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.
03023008 For seven days present a food offering to the Lord. And on the seventh day hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.’ ”
03023009 The Lord said to Moses,
03023010 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When you enter the land I am going to give you and you reap its harvest, bring to the priest a sheaf of the first grain you harvest.
03023011 He is to wave the sheaf before the Lord so it will be accepted on your behalf; the priest is to wave it on the day after the Sabbath.
03023012 On the day you wave the sheaf, you must sacrifice as a burnt offering to the Lord a lamb a year old without defect,
03023013 together with its grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with olive oil—a food offering presented to the Lord, a pleasing aroma—and its drink offering of a quarter of a hin of wine.
03023014 You must not eat any bread, or roasted or new grain, until the very day you bring this offering to your God. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live.
03023015 “ ‘From the day after the Sabbath, the day you brought the sheaf of the wave offering, count off seven full weeks.
03023016 Count off fifty days up to the day after the seventh Sabbath, and then present an offering of new grain to the Lord.
03023017 From wherever you live, bring two loaves made of two-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour, baked with yeast, as a wave offering of firstfruits to the Lord.
03023018 Present with this bread seven male lambs, each a year old and without defect, one young bull and two rams. They will be a burnt offering to the Lord, together with their grain offerings and drink offerings—a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
03023019 Then sacrifice one male goat for a sin offering and two lambs, each a year old, for a fellowship offering.
03023020 The priest is to wave the two lambs before the Lord as a wave offering, together with the bread of the firstfruits. They are a sacred offering to the Lord for the priest.
03023021 On that same day you are to proclaim a sacred assembly and do no regular work. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live.
03023022 “ ‘When you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap to the very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Leave them for the poor and for the foreigner residing among you. I am the Lord your God.’ ”
03023023 The Lord said to Moses,
03023024 “Say to the Israelites: ‘On the first day of the seventh month you are to have a day of sabbath rest, a sacred assembly commemorated with trumpet blasts.
03023025 Do no regular work, but present a food offering to the Lord.’ ”
03023026 The Lord said to Moses,
03023027 “The tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. Hold a sacred assembly and deny yourselves, and present a food offering to the Lord.
03023028 Do not do any work on that day, because it is the Day of Atonement, when atonement is made for you before the Lord your God.
03023029 Those who do not deny themselves on that day must be cut off from their people.
03023030 I will destroy from among their people anyone who does any work on that day.
03023031 You shall do no work at all. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live.
03023032 It is a day of sabbath rest for you, and you must deny yourselves. From the evening of the ninth day of the month until the following evening you are to observe your sabbath.”
03023033 The Lord said to Moses,
03023034 “Say to the Israelites: ‘On the fifteenth day of the seventh month the Lord’s Festival of Tabernacles begins, and it lasts for seven days.
03023035 The first day is a sacred assembly; do no regular work.
03023036 For seven days present food offerings to the Lord, and on the eighth day hold a sacred assembly and present a food offering to the Lord. It is the closing special assembly; do no regular work.
03023037 (“ ‘These are the Lord’s appointed festivals, which you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies for bringing food offerings to the Lord—the burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings required for each day.
03023038 These offerings are in addition to those for the Lord’s Sabbaths and in addition to your gifts and whatever you have vowed and all the freewill offerings you give to the Lord.)
03023039 “ ‘So beginning with the fifteenth day of the seventh month, after you have gathered the crops of the land, celebrate the festival to the Lord for seven days; the first day is a day of sabbath rest, and the eighth day also is a day of sabbath rest.
03023040 On the first day you are to take branches from luxuriant trees—from palms, willows and other leafy trees—and rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days.
03023041 Celebrate this as a festival to the Lord for seven days each year. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come; celebrate it in the seventh month.
03023042 Live in temporary shelters for seven days: All native-born Israelites are to live in such shelters
03023043 so your descendants will know that I had the Israelites live in temporary shelters when I brought them out of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.’ ”
03023044 So Moses announced to the Israelites the appointed festivals of the Lord.
03024001 The Lord said to Moses,
03024002 “Command the Israelites to bring you clear oil of pressed olives for the light so that the lamps may be kept burning continually.
03024003 Outside the curtain that shields the ark of the covenant law in the tent of meeting, Aaron is to tend the lamps before the Lord from evening till morning, continually. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.
03024004 The lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the Lord must be tended continually.
03024005 “Take the finest flour and bake twelve loaves of bread, using two-tenths of an ephah for each loaf.
03024006 Arrange them in two stacks, six in each stack, on the table of pure gold before the Lord.
03024007 By each stack put some pure incense as a memorial portion to represent the bread and to be a food offering presented to the Lord.
03024008 This bread is to be set out before the Lord regularly, Sabbath after Sabbath, on behalf of the Israelites, as a lasting covenant.
03024009 It belongs to Aaron and his sons, who are to eat it in the sanctuary area, because it is a most holy part of their perpetual share of the food offerings presented to the Lord.”
03024010 Now the son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father went out among the Israelites, and a fight broke out in the camp between him and an Israelite.
03024011 The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name with a curse; so they brought him to Moses. (His mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri the Danite.)
03024012 They put him in custody until the will of the Lord should be made clear to them.
03024013 Then the Lord said to Moses:
03024014 “Take the blasphemer outside the camp. All those who heard him are to lay their hands on his head, and the entire assembly is to stone him.
03024015 Say to the Israelites: ‘Anyone who curses their God will be held responsible;
03024016 anyone who blasphemes the name of the Lord is to be put to death. The entire assembly must stone them. Whether foreigner or native-born, when they blaspheme the Name they are to be put to death.
03024017 “ ‘Anyone who takes the life of a human being is to be put to death.
03024018 Anyone who takes the life of someone’s animal must make restitution—life for life.
03024019 Anyone who injures their neighbor is to be injured in the same manner:
03024020 fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. The one who has inflicted the injury must suffer the same injury.
03024021 Whoever kills an animal must make restitution, but whoever kills a human being is to be put to death.
03024022 You are to have the same law for the foreigner and the native-born. I am the Lord your God.’ ”
03024023 Then Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him. The Israelites did as the Lord commanded Moses.
03025001 The Lord said to Moses at Mount Sinai,
03025002 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When you enter the land I am going to give you, the land itself must observe a sabbath to the Lord.
03025003 For six years sow your fields, and for six years prune your vineyards and gather their crops.
03025004 But in the seventh year the land is to have a year of sabbath rest, a sabbath to the Lord. Do not sow your fields or prune your vineyards.
03025005 Do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the grapes of your untended vines. The land is to have a year of rest.
03025006 Whatever the land yields during the sabbath year will be food for you—for yourself, your male and female servants, and the hired worker and temporary resident who live among you,
03025007 as well as for your livestock and the wild animals in your land. Whatever the land produces may be eaten.
03025008 “ ‘Count off seven sabbath years—seven times seven years—so that the seven sabbath years amount to a period of forty-nine years.
03025009 Then have the trumpet sounded everywhere on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement sound the trumpet throughout your land.
03025010 Consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you; each of you is to return to your family property and to your own clan.
03025011 The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; do not sow and do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the untended vines.
03025012 For it is a jubilee and is to be holy for you; eat only what is taken directly from the fields.
03025013 “ ‘In this Year of Jubilee everyone is to return to their own property.
03025014 “ ‘If you sell land to any of your own people or buy land from them, do not take advantage of each other.
03025015 You are to buy from your own people on the basis of the number of years since the Jubilee. And they are to sell to you on the basis of the number of years left for harvesting crops.
03025016 When the years are many, you are to increase the price, and when the years are few, you are to decrease the price, because what is really being sold to you is the number of crops.
03025017 Do not take advantage of each other, but fear your God. I am the Lord your God.
03025018 “ ‘Follow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws, and you will live safely in the land.
03025019 Then the land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live there in safety.
03025020 You may ask, “What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not plant or harvest our crops?”
03025021 I will send you such a blessing in the sixth year that the land will yield enough for three years.
03025022 While you plant during the eighth year, you will eat from the old crop and will continue to eat from it until the harvest of the ninth year comes in.
03025023 “ ‘The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is mine and you reside in my land as foreigners and strangers.
03025024 Throughout the land that you hold as a possession, you must provide for the redemption of the land.
03025025 “ ‘If one of your fellow Israelites becomes poor and sells some of their property, their nearest relative is to come and redeem what they have sold.
03025026 If, however, there is no one to redeem it for them but later on they prosper and acquire sufficient means to redeem it themselves,
03025027 they are to determine the value for the years since they sold it and refund the balance to the one to whom they sold it; they can then go back to their own property.
03025028 But if they do not acquire the means to repay, what was sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. It will be returned in the Jubilee, and they can then go back to their property.
03025029 “ ‘Anyone who sells a house in a walled city retains the right of redemption a full year after its sale. During that time the seller may redeem it.
03025030 If it is not redeemed before a full year has passed, the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to the buyer and the buyer’s descendants. It is not to be returned in the Jubilee.
03025031 But houses in villages without walls around them are to be considered as belonging to the open country. They can be redeemed, and they are to be returned in the Jubilee.
03025032 “ ‘The Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the Levitical towns, which they possess.
03025033 So the property of the Levites is redeemable—that is, a house sold in any town they hold—and is to be returned in the Jubilee, because the houses in the towns of the Levites are their property among the Israelites.
03025034 But the pastureland belonging to their towns must not be sold; it is their permanent possession.
03025035 “ ‘If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and are unable to support themselves among you, help them as you would a foreigner and stranger, so they can continue to live among you.
03025036 Do not take interest or any profit from them, but fear your God, so that they may continue to live among you.
03025037 You must not lend them money at interest or sell them food at a profit.
03025038 I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.
03025039 “ ‘If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to you, do not make them work as slaves.
03025040 They are to be treated as hired workers or temporary residents among you; they are to work for you until the Year of Jubilee.
03025041 Then they and their children are to be released, and they will go back to their own clans and to the property of their ancestors.
03025042 Because the Israelites are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt, they must not be sold as slaves.
03025043 Do not rule over them ruthlessly, but fear your God.
03025044 “ ‘Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves.
03025045 You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property.
03025046 You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly.
03025047 “ ‘If a foreigner residing among you becomes rich and any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to the foreigner or to a member of the foreigner’s clan,
03025048 they retain the right of redemption after they have sold themselves. One of their relatives may redeem them:
03025049 An uncle or a cousin or any blood relative in their clan may redeem them. Or if they prosper, they may redeem themselves.
03025050 They and their buyer are to count the time from the year they sold themselves up to the Year of Jubilee. The price for their release is to be based on the rate paid to a hired worker for that number of years.
03025051 If many years remain, they must pay for their redemption a larger share of the price paid for them.
03025052 If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, they are to compute that and pay for their redemption accordingly.
03025053 They are to be treated as workers hired from year to year; you must see to it that those to whom they owe service do not rule over them ruthlessly.
03025054 “ ‘Even if someone is not redeemed in any of these ways, they and their children are to be released in the Year of Jubilee,
03025055 for the Israelites belong to me as servants. They are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.
03026001 “ ‘Do not make idols or set up an image or a sacred stone for yourselves, and do not place a carved stone in your land to bow down before it. I am the Lord your God.
03026002 “ ‘Observe my Sabbaths and have reverence for my sanctuary. I am the Lord.
03026003 “ ‘If you follow my decrees and are careful to obey my commands,
03026004 I will send you rain in its season, and the ground will yield its crops and the trees their fruit.
03026005 Your threshing will continue until grape harvest and the grape harvest will continue until planting, and you will eat all the food you want and live in safety in your land.
03026006 “ ‘I will grant peace in the land, and you will lie down and no one will make you afraid. I will remove wild beasts from the land, and the sword will not pass through your country.
03026007 You will pursue your enemies, and they will fall by the sword before you.
03026008 Five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand, and your enemies will fall by the sword before you.
03026009 “ ‘I will look on you with favor and make you fruitful and increase your numbers, and I will keep my covenant with you.
03026010 You will still be eating last year’s harvest when you will have to move it out to make room for the new.
03026011 I will put my dwelling place among you, and I will not abhor you.
03026012 I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be my people.
03026013 I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt so that you would no longer be slaves to the Egyptians; I broke the bars of your yoke and enabled you to walk with heads held high.
03026014 “ ‘But if you will not listen to me and carry out all these commands,
03026015 and if you reject my decrees and abhor my laws and fail to carry out all my commands and so violate my covenant,
03026016 then I will do this to you: I will bring on you sudden terror, wasting diseases and fever that will destroy your sight and sap your strength. You will plant seed in vain, because your enemies will eat it.
03026017 I will set my face against you so that you will be defeated by your enemies; those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee even when no one is pursuing you.
03026018 “ ‘If after all this you will not listen to me, I will punish you for your sins seven times over.
03026019 I will break down your stubborn pride and make the sky above you like iron and the ground beneath you like bronze.
03026020 Your strength will be spent in vain, because your soil will not yield its crops, nor will the trees of your land yield their fruit.
03026021 “ ‘If you remain hostile toward me and refuse to listen to me, I will multiply your afflictions seven times over, as your sins deserve.
03026022 I will send wild animals against you, and they will rob you of your children, destroy your cattle and make you so few in number that your roads will be deserted.
03026023 “ ‘If in spite of these things you do not accept my correction but continue to be hostile toward me,
03026024 I myself will be hostile toward you and will afflict you for your sins seven times over.
03026025 And I will bring the sword on you to avenge the breaking of the covenant. When you withdraw into your cities, I will send a plague among you, and you will be given into enemy hands.
03026026 When I cut off your supply of bread, ten women will be able to bake your bread in one oven, and they will dole out the bread by weight. You will eat, but you will not be satisfied.
03026027 “ ‘If in spite of this you still do not listen to me but continue to be hostile toward me,
03026028 then in my anger I will be hostile toward you, and I myself will punish you for your sins seven times over.
03026029 You will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters.
03026030 I will destroy your high places, cut down your incense altars and pile your dead bodies on the lifeless forms of your idols, and I will abhor you.
03026031 I will turn your cities into ruins and lay waste your sanctuaries, and I will take no delight in the pleasing aroma of your offerings.
03026032 I myself will lay waste the land, so that your enemies who live there will be appalled.
03026033 I will scatter you among the nations and will draw out my sword and pursue you. Your land will be laid waste, and your cities will lie in ruins.
03026034 Then the land will enjoy its sabbath years all the time that it lies desolate and you are in the country of your enemies; then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths.
03026035 All the time that it lies desolate, the land will have the rest it did not have during the sabbaths you lived in it.
03026036 “ ‘As for those of you who are left, I will make their hearts so fearful in the lands of their enemies that the sound of a windblown leaf will put them to flight. They will run as though fleeing from the sword, and they will fall, even though no one is pursuing them.
03026037 They will stumble over one another as though fleeing from the sword, even though no one is pursuing them. So you will not be able to stand before your enemies.
03026038 You will perish among the nations; the land of your enemies will devour you.
03026039 Those of you who are left will waste away in the lands of their enemies because of their sins; also because of their ancestors’ sins they will waste away.
03026040 “ ‘But if they will confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors—their unfaithfulness and their hostility toward me,
03026041 which made me hostile toward them so that I sent them into the land of their enemies—then when their uncircumcised hearts are humbled and they pay for their sin,
03026042 I will remember my covenant with Jacob and my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.
03026043 For the land will be deserted by them and will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them. They will pay for their sins because they rejected my laws and abhorred my decrees.
03026044 Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them or abhor them so as to destroy them completely, breaking my covenant with them. I am the Lord their God.
03026045 But for their sake I will remember the covenant with their ancestors whom I brought out of Egypt in the sight of the nations to be their God. I am the Lord.’ ”
03026046 These are the decrees, the laws and the regulations that the Lord established at Mount Sinai between himself and the Israelites through Moses.
03027001 The Lord said to Moses,
03027002 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘If anyone makes a special vow to dedicate a person to the Lord by giving the equivalent value,
03027003 set the value of a male between the ages of twenty and sixty at fifty shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel ;
03027004 for a female, set her value at thirty shekels ;
03027005 for a person between the ages of five and twenty, set the value of a male at twenty shekels and of a female at ten shekels ;
03027006 for a person between one month and five years, set the value of a male at five shekels of silver and that of a female at three shekels of silver;
03027007 for a person sixty years old or more, set the value of a male at fifteen shekels and of a female at ten shekels.
03027008 If anyone making the vow is too poor to pay the specified amount, the person being dedicated is to be presented to the priest, who will set the value according to what the one making the vow can afford.
03027009 “ ‘If what they vowed is an animal that is acceptable as an offering to the Lord, such an animal given to the Lord becomes holy.
03027010 They must not exchange it or substitute a good one for a bad one, or a bad one for a good one; if they should substitute one animal for another, both it and the substitute become holy.
03027011 If what they vowed is a ceremonially unclean animal—one that is not acceptable as an offering to the Lord—the animal must be presented to the priest,
03027012 who will judge its quality as good or bad. Whatever value the priest then sets, that is what it will be.
03027013 If the owner wishes to redeem the animal, a fifth must be added to its value.
03027014 “ ‘If anyone dedicates their house as something holy to the Lord, the priest will judge its quality as good or bad. Whatever value the priest then sets, so it will remain.
03027015 If the one who dedicates their house wishes to redeem it, they must add a fifth to its value, and the house will again become theirs.
03027016 “ ‘If anyone dedicates to the Lord part of their family land, its value is to be set according to the amount of seed required for it—fifty shekels of silver to a homer of barley seed.
03027017 If they dedicate a field during the Year of Jubilee, the value that has been set remains.
03027018 But if they dedicate a field after the Jubilee, the priest will determine the value according to the number of years that remain until the next Year of Jubilee, and its set value will be reduced.
03027019 If the one who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, they must add a fifth to its value, and the field will again become theirs.
03027020 If, however, they do not redeem the field, or if they have sold it to someone else, it can never be redeemed.
03027021 When the field is released in the Jubilee, it will become holy, like a field devoted to the Lord; it will become priestly property.
03027022 “ ‘If anyone dedicates to the Lord a field they have bought, which is not part of their family land,
03027023 the priest will determine its value up to the Year of Jubilee, and the owner must pay its value on that day as something holy to the Lord.
03027024 In the Year of Jubilee the field will revert to the person from whom it was bought, the one whose land it was.
03027025 Every value is to be set according to the sanctuary shekel, twenty gerahs to the shekel.
03027026 “ ‘No one, however, may dedicate the firstborn of an animal, since the firstborn already belongs to the Lord; whether an ox or a sheep, it is the Lord’s.
03027027 If it is one of the unclean animals, it may be bought back at its set value, adding a fifth of the value to it. If it is not redeemed, it is to be sold at its set value.
03027028 “ ‘But nothing that a person owns and devotes to the Lord—whether a human being or an animal or family land—may be sold or redeemed; everything so devoted is most holy to the Lord.
03027029 “ ‘No person devoted to destruction may be ransomed; they are to be put to death.
03027030 “ ‘A tithe of everything from the land, whether grain from the soil or fruit from the trees, belongs to the Lord; it is holy to the Lord.
03027031 Whoever would redeem any of their tithe must add a fifth of the value to it.
03027032 Every tithe of the herd and flock—every tenth animal that passes under the shepherd’s rod—will be holy to the Lord.
03027033 No one may pick out the good from the bad or make any substitution. If anyone does make a substitution, both the animal and its substitute become holy and cannot be redeemed.’ ”
03027034 These are the commands the Lord gave Moses at Mount Sinai for the Israelites.
04001001 The Lord spoke to Moses in the tent of meeting in the Desert of Sinai on the first day of the second month of the second year after the Israelites came out of Egypt. He said:
04001002 “Take a census of the whole Israelite community by their clans and families, listing every man by name, one by one.
04001003 You and Aaron are to count according to their divisions all the men in Israel who are twenty years old or more and able to serve in the army.
04001004 One man from each tribe, each of them the head of his family, is to help you.
04001005 These are the names of the men who are to assist you: from Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur;
04001006 from Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai;
04001007 from Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab;
04001008 from Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar;
04001009 from Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon;
04001010 from the sons of Joseph: from Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud; from Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur;
04001011 from Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni;
04001012 from Dan, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai;
04001013 from Asher, Pagiel son of Okran;
04001014 from Gad, Eliasaph son of Deuel;
04001015 from Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan.”
04001016 These were the men appointed from the community, the leaders of their ancestral tribes. They were the heads of the clans of Israel.
04001017 Moses and Aaron took these men whose names had been specified,
04001018 and they called the whole community together on the first day of the second month. The people registered their ancestry by their clans and families, and the men twenty years old or more were listed by name, one by one,
04001019 as the Lord commanded Moses. And so he counted them in the Desert of Sinai:
04001020 From the descendants of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, one by one, according to the records of their clans and families.
04001021 The number from the tribe of Reuben was 46,500.
04001022 From the descendants of Simeon: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were counted and listed by name, one by one, according to the records of their clans and families.
04001023 The number from the tribe of Simeon was 59,300.
04001024 From the descendants of Gad: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.
04001025 The number from the tribe of Gad was 45,650.
04001026 From the descendants of Judah: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.
04001027 The number from the tribe of Judah was 74,600.
04001028 From the descendants of Issachar: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.
04001029 The number from the tribe of Issachar was 54,400.
04001030 From the descendants of Zebulun: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.
04001031 The number from the tribe of Zebulun was 57,400.
04001032 From the sons of Joseph: From the descendants of Ephraim: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.
04001033 The number from the tribe of Ephraim was 40,500.
04001034 From the descendants of Manasseh: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.
04001035 The number from the tribe of Manasseh was 32,200.
04001036 From the descendants of Benjamin: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.
04001037 The number from the tribe of Benjamin was 35,400.
04001038 From the descendants of Dan: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.
04001039 The number from the tribe of Dan was 62,700.
04001040 From the descendants of Asher: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.
04001041 The number from the tribe of Asher was 41,500.
04001042 From the descendants of Naphtali: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.
04001043 The number from the tribe of Naphtali was 53,400.
04001044 These were the men counted by Moses and Aaron and the twelve leaders of Israel, each one representing his family.
04001045 All the Israelites twenty years old or more who were able to serve in Israel’s army were counted according to their families.
04001046 The total number was 603,550.
04001047 The ancestral tribe of the Levites, however, was not counted along with the others.
04001048 The Lord had said to Moses:
04001049 “You must not count the tribe of Levi or include them in the census of the other Israelites.
04001050 Instead, appoint the Levites to be in charge of the tabernacle of the covenant law—over all its furnishings and everything belonging to it. They are to carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; they are to take care of it and encamp around it.
04001051 Whenever the tabernacle is to move, the Levites are to take it down, and whenever the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall do it. Anyone else who approaches it is to be put to death.
04001052 The Israelites are to set up their tents by divisions, each of them in their own camp under their standard.
04001053 The Levites, however, are to set up their tents around the tabernacle of the covenant law so that my wrath will not fall on the Israelite community. The Levites are to be responsible for the care of the tabernacle of the covenant law.”
04001054 The Israelites did all this just as the Lord commanded Moses.
04002001 The Lord said to Moses and Aaron:
04002002 “The Israelites are to camp around the tent of meeting some distance from it, each of them under their standard and holding the banners of their family.”
04002003 On the east, toward the sunrise, the divisions of the camp of Judah are to encamp under their standard. The leader of the people of Judah is Nahshon son of Amminadab.
04002004 His division numbers 74,600.
04002005 The tribe of Issachar will camp next to them. The leader of the people of Issachar is Nethanel son of Zuar.
04002006 His division numbers 54,400.
04002007 The tribe of Zebulun will be next. The leader of the people of Zebulun is Eliab son of Helon.
04002008 His division numbers 57,400.
04002009 All the men assigned to the camp of Judah, according to their divisions, number 186,400. They will set out first.
04002010 On the south will be the divisions of the camp of Reuben under their standard. The leader of the people of Reuben is Elizur son of Shedeur.
04002011 His division numbers 46,500.
04002012 The tribe of Simeon will camp next to them. The leader of the people of Simeon is Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai.
04002013 His division numbers 59,300.
04002014 The tribe of Gad will be next. The leader of the people of Gad is Eliasaph son of Deuel.
04002015 His division numbers 45,650.
04002016 All the men assigned to the camp of Reuben, according to their divisions, number 151,450. They will set out second.
04002017 Then the tent of meeting and the camp of the Levites will set out in the middle of the camps. They will set out in the same order as they encamp, each in their own place under their standard.
04002018 On the west will be the divisions of the camp of Ephraim under their standard. The leader of the people of Ephraim is Elishama son of Ammihud.
04002019 His division numbers 40,500.
04002020 The tribe of Manasseh will be next to them. The leader of the people of Manasseh is Gamaliel son of Pedahzur.
04002021 His division numbers 32,200.
04002022 The tribe of Benjamin will be next. The leader of the people of Benjamin is Abidan son of Gideoni.
04002023 His division numbers 35,400.
04002024 All the men assigned to the camp of Ephraim, according to their divisions, number 108,100. They will set out third.
04002025 On the north will be the divisions of the camp of Dan under their standard. The leader of the people of Dan is Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai.
04002026 His division numbers 62,700.
04002027 The tribe of Asher will camp next to them. The leader of the people of Asher is Pagiel son of Okran.
04002028 His division numbers 41,500.
04002029 The tribe of Naphtali will be next. The leader of the people of Naphtali is Ahira son of Enan.
04002030 His division numbers 53,400.
04002031 All the men assigned to the camp of Dan number 157,600. They will set out last, under their standards.
04002032 These are the Israelites, counted according to their families. All the men in the camps, by their divisions, number 603,550.
04002033 The Levites, however, were not counted along with the other Israelites, as the Lord commanded Moses.
04002034 So the Israelites did everything the Lord commanded Moses; that is the way they encamped under their standards, and that is the way they set out, each of them with their clan and family.
04003001 This is the account of the family of Aaron and Moses at the time the Lord spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai.
04003002 The names of the sons of Aaron were Nadab the firstborn and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
04003003 Those were the names of Aaron’s sons, the anointed priests, who were ordained to serve as priests.
04003004 Nadab and Abihu, however, died before the Lord when they made an offering with unauthorized fire before him in the Desert of Sinai. They had no sons, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their father Aaron.
04003005 The Lord said to Moses,
04003006 “Bring the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron the priest to assist him.
04003007 They are to perform duties for him and for the whole community at the tent of meeting by doing the work of the tabernacle.
04003008 They are to take care of all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, fulfilling the obligations of the Israelites by doing the work of the tabernacle.
04003009 Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are the Israelites who are to be given wholly to him.
04003010 Appoint Aaron and his sons to serve as priests; anyone else who approaches the sanctuary is to be put to death.”
04003011 The Lord also said to Moses,
04003012 “I have taken the Levites from among the Israelites in place of the first male offspring of every Israelite woman. The Levites are mine,
04003013 for all the firstborn are mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set apart for myself every firstborn in Israel, whether human or animal. They are to be mine. I am the Lord.”
04003014 The Lord said to Moses in the Desert of Sinai,
04003015 “Count the Levites by their families and clans. Count every male a month old or more.”
04003016 So Moses counted them, as he was commanded by the word of the Lord.
04003017 These were the names of the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari.
04003018 These were the names of the Gershonite clans: Libni and Shimei.
04003019 The Kohathite clans: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel.
04003020 The Merarite clans: Mahli and Mushi. These were the Levite clans, according to their families.
04003021 To Gershon belonged the clans of the Libnites and Shimeites; these were the Gershonite clans.
04003022 The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 7,500.
04003023 The Gershonite clans were to camp on the west, behind the tabernacle.
04003024 The leader of the families of the Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael.
04003025 At the tent of meeting the Gershonites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle and tent, its coverings, the curtain at the entrance to the tent of meeting,
04003026 the curtains of the courtyard, the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and altar, and the ropes—and everything related to their use.
04003027 To Kohath belonged the clans of the Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites and Uzzielites; these were the Kohathite clans.
04003028 The number of all the males a month old or more was 8,600. The Kohathites were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.
04003029 The Kohathite clans were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle.
04003030 The leader of the families of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of Uzziel.
04003031 They were responsible for the care of the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the articles of the sanctuary used in ministering, the curtain, and everything related to their use.
04003032 The chief leader of the Levites was Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest. He was appointed over those who were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.
04003033 To Merari belonged the clans of the Mahlites and the Mushites; these were the Merarite clans.
04003034 The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 6,200.
04003035 The leader of the families of the Merarite clans was Zuriel son of Abihail; they were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.
04003036 The Merarites were appointed to take care of the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, posts, bases, all its equipment, and everything related to their use,
04003037 as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs and ropes.
04003038 Moses and Aaron and his sons were to camp to the east of the tabernacle, toward the sunrise, in front of the tent of meeting. They were responsible for the care of the sanctuary on behalf of the Israelites. Anyone else who approached the sanctuary was to be put to death.
04003039 The total number of Levites counted at the Lord’s command by Moses and Aaron according to their clans, including every male a month old or more, was 22,000.
04003040 The Lord said to Moses, “Count all the firstborn Israelite males who are a month old or more and make a list of their names.
04003041 Take the Levites for me in place of all the firstborn of the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the livestock of the Israelites. I am the Lord.”
04003042 So Moses counted all the firstborn of the Israelites, as the Lord commanded him.
04003043 The total number of firstborn males a month old or more, listed by name, was 22,273.
04003044 The Lord also said to Moses,
04003045 “Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites in place of their livestock. The Levites are to be mine. I am the Lord.
04003046 To redeem the 273 firstborn Israelites who exceed the number of the Levites,
04003047 collect five shekels for each one, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs.
04003048 Give the money for the redemption of the additional Israelites to Aaron and his sons.”
04003049 So Moses collected the redemption money from those who exceeded the number redeemed by the Levites.
04003050 From the firstborn of the Israelites he collected silver weighing 1,365 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.
04003051 Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, as he was commanded by the word of the Lord.
04004001 The Lord said to Moses and Aaron:
04004002 “Take a census of the Kohathite branch of the Levites by their clans and families.
04004003 Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work at the tent of meeting.
04004004 “This is the work of the Kohathites at the tent of meeting: the care of the most holy things.
04004005 When the camp is to move, Aaron and his sons are to go in and take down the shielding curtain and put it over the ark of the covenant law.
04004006 Then they are to cover the curtain with a durable leather, spread a cloth of solid blue over that and put the poles in place.
04004007 “Over the table of the Presence they are to spread a blue cloth and put on it the plates, dishes and bowls, and the jars for drink offerings; the bread that is continually there is to remain on it.
04004008 They are to spread a scarlet cloth over them, cover that with the durable leather and put the poles in place.
04004009 “They are to take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand that is for light, together with its lamps, its wick trimmers and trays, and all its jars for the olive oil used to supply it.
04004010 Then they are to wrap it and all its accessories in a covering of the durable leather and put it on a carrying frame.
04004011 “Over the gold altar they are to spread a blue cloth and cover that with the durable leather and put the poles in place.
04004012 “They are to take all the articles used for ministering in the sanctuary, wrap them in a blue cloth, cover that with the durable leather and put them on a carrying frame.
04004013 “They are to remove the ashes from the bronze altar and spread a purple cloth over it.
04004014 Then they are to place on it all the utensils used for ministering at the altar, including the firepans, meat forks, shovels and sprinkling bowls. Over it they are to spread a covering of the durable leather and put the poles in place.
04004015 “After Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy furnishings and all the holy articles, and when the camp is ready to move, only then are the Kohathites to come and do the carrying. But they must not touch the holy things or they will die. The Kohathites are to carry those things that are in the tent of meeting.
04004016 “Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, is to have charge of the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the regular grain offering and the anointing oil. He is to be in charge of the entire tabernacle and everything in it, including its holy furnishings and articles.”
04004017 The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
04004018 “See that the Kohathite tribal clans are not destroyed from among the Levites.
04004019 So that they may live and not die when they come near the most holy things, do this for them: Aaron and his sons are to go into the sanctuary and assign to each man his work and what he is to carry.
04004020 But the Kohathites must not go in to look at the holy things, even for a moment, or they will die.”
04004021 The Lord said to Moses,
04004022 “Take a census also of the Gershonites by their families and clans.
04004023 Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work at the tent of meeting.
04004024 “This is the service of the Gershonite clans in their carrying and their other work:
04004025 They are to carry the curtains of the tabernacle, that is, the tent of meeting, its covering and its outer covering of durable leather, the curtains for the entrance to the tent of meeting,
04004026 the curtains of the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and altar, the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard, the ropes and all the equipment used in the service of the tent. The Gershonites are to do all that needs to be done with these things.
04004027 All their service, whether carrying or doing other work, is to be done under the direction of Aaron and his sons. You shall assign to them as their responsibility all they are to carry.
04004028 This is the service of the Gershonite clans at the tent of meeting. Their duties are to be under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest.
04004029 “Count the Merarites by their clans and families.
04004030 Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work at the tent of meeting.
04004031 As part of all their service at the tent, they are to carry the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, posts and bases,
04004032 as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs, ropes, all their equipment and everything related to their use. Assign to each man the specific things he is to carry.
04004033 This is the service of the Merarite clans as they work at the tent of meeting under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest.”
04004034 Moses, Aaron and the leaders of the community counted the Kohathites by their clans and families.
04004035 All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to serve in the work at the tent of meeting,
04004036 counted by clans, were 2,750.
04004037 This was the total of all those in the Kohathite clans who served at the tent of meeting. Moses and Aaron counted them according to the Lord’s command through Moses.
04004038 The Gershonites were counted by their clans and families.
04004039 All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to serve in the work at the tent of meeting,
04004040 counted by their clans and families, were 2,630.
04004041 This was the total of those in the Gershonite clans who served at the tent of meeting. Moses and Aaron counted them according to the Lord’s command.
04004042 The Merarites were counted by their clans and families.
04004043 All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to serve in the work at the tent of meeting,
04004044 counted by their clans, were 3,200.
04004045 This was the total of those in the Merarite clans. Moses and Aaron counted them according to the Lord’s command through Moses.
04004046 So Moses, Aaron and the leaders of Israel counted all the Levites by their clans and families.
04004047 All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to do the work of serving and carrying the tent of meeting
04004048 numbered 8,580.
04004049 At the Lord’s command through Moses, each was assigned his work and told what to carry. Thus they were counted, as the Lord commanded Moses.
04005001 The Lord said to Moses,
04005002 “Command the Israelites to send away from the camp anyone who has a defiling skin disease or a discharge of any kind, or who is ceremonially unclean because of a dead body.
04005003 Send away male and female alike; send them outside the camp so they will not defile their camp, where I dwell among them.”
04005004 The Israelites did so; they sent them outside the camp. They did just as the Lord had instructed Moses.
04005005 The Lord said to Moses,
04005006 “Say to the Israelites: ‘Any man or woman who wrongs another in any way and so is unfaithful to the Lord is guilty
04005007 and must confess the sin they have committed. They must make full restitution for the wrong they have done, add a fifth of the value to it and give it all to the person they have wronged.
04005008 But if that person has no close relative to whom restitution can be made for the wrong, the restitution belongs to the Lord and must be given to the priest, along with the ram with which atonement is made for the wrongdoer.
04005009 All the sacred contributions the Israelites bring to a priest will belong to him.
04005010 Sacred things belong to their owners, but what they give to the priest will belong to the priest.’ ”
04005011 Then the Lord said to Moses,
04005012 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘If a man’s wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him
04005013 so that another man has sexual relations with her, and this is hidden from her husband and her impurity is undetected (since there is no witness against her and she has not been caught in the act),
04005014 and if feelings of jealousy come over her husband and he suspects his wife and she is impure—or if he is jealous and suspects her even though she is not impure—
04005015 then he is to take his wife to the priest. He must also take an offering of a tenth of an ephah of barley flour on her behalf. He must not pour olive oil on it or put incense on it, because it is a grain offering for jealousy, a reminder-offering to draw attention to wrongdoing.
04005016 “ ‘The priest shall bring her and have her stand before the Lord.
04005017 Then he shall take some holy water in a clay jar and put some dust from the tabernacle floor into the water.
04005018 After the priest has had the woman stand before the Lord, he shall loosen her hair and place in her hands the reminder-offering, the grain offering for jealousy, while he himself holds the bitter water that brings a curse.
04005019 Then the priest shall put the woman under oath and say to her, “If no other man has had sexual relations with you and you have not gone astray and become impure while married to your husband, may this bitter water that brings a curse not harm you.
04005020 But if you have gone astray while married to your husband and you have made yourself impure by having sexual relations with a man other than your husband”—
04005021 here the priest is to put the woman under this curse—“may the Lord cause you to become a curse among your people when he makes your womb miscarry and your abdomen swell.
04005022 May this water that brings a curse enter your body so that your abdomen swells or your womb miscarries.” “ ‘Then the woman is to say, “Amen. So be it.”
04005023 “ ‘The priest is to write these curses on a scroll and then wash them off into the bitter water.
04005024 He shall make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and this water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering will enter her.
04005025 The priest is to take from her hands the grain offering for jealousy, wave it before the Lord and bring it to the altar.
04005026 The priest is then to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial offering and burn it on the altar; after that, he is to have the woman drink the water.
04005027 If she has made herself impure and been unfaithful to her husband, this will be the result: When she is made to drink the water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering, it will enter her, her abdomen will swell and her womb will miscarry, and she will become a curse.
04005028 If, however, the woman has not made herself impure, but is clean, she will be cleared of guilt and will be able to have children.
04005029 “ ‘This, then, is the law of jealousy when a woman goes astray and makes herself impure while married to her husband,
04005030 or when feelings of jealousy come over a man because he suspects his wife. The priest is to have her stand before the Lord and is to apply this entire law to her.
04005031 The husband will be innocent of any wrongdoing, but the woman will bear the consequences of her sin.’ ”
04006001 The Lord said to Moses,
04006002 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘If a man or woman wants to make a special vow, a vow of dedication to the Lord as a Nazirite,
04006003 they must abstain from wine and other fermented drink and must not drink vinegar made from wine or other fermented drink. They must not drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins.
04006004 As long as they remain under their Nazirite vow, they must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, not even the seeds or skins.
04006005 “ ‘During the entire period of their Nazirite vow, no razor may be used on their head. They must be holy until the period of their dedication to the Lord is over; they must let their hair grow long.
04006006 “ ‘Throughout the period of their dedication to the Lord, the Nazirite must not go near a dead body.
04006007 Even if their own father or mother or brother or sister dies, they must not make themselves ceremonially unclean on account of them, because the symbol of their dedication to God is on their head.
04006008 Throughout the period of their dedication, they are consecrated to the Lord.
04006009 “ ‘If someone dies suddenly in the Nazirite’s presence, thus defiling the hair that symbolizes their dedication, they must shave their head on the seventh day—the day of their cleansing.
04006010 Then on the eighth day they must bring two doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
04006011 The priest is to offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to make atonement for the Nazirite because they sinned by being in the presence of the dead body. That same day they are to consecrate their head again.
04006012 They must rededicate themselves to the Lord for the same period of dedication and must bring a year-old male lamb as a guilt offering. The previous days do not count, because they became defiled during their period of dedication.
04006013 “ ‘Now this is the law of the Nazirite when the period of their dedication is over. They are to be brought to the entrance to the tent of meeting.
04006014 There they are to present their offerings to the Lord: a year-old male lamb without defect for a burnt offering, a year-old ewe lamb without defect for a sin offering, a ram without defect for a fellowship offering,
04006015 together with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and a basket of bread made with the finest flour and without yeast—thick loaves with olive oil mixed in, and thin loaves brushed with olive oil.
04006016 “ ‘The priest is to present all these before the Lord and make the sin offering and the burnt offering.
04006017 He is to present the basket of unleavened bread and is to sacrifice the ram as a fellowship offering to the Lord, together with its grain offering and drink offering.
04006018 “ ‘Then at the entrance to the tent of meeting, the Nazirite must shave off the hair that symbolizes their dedication. They are to take the hair and put it in the fire that is under the sacrifice of the fellowship offering.
04006019 “ ‘After the Nazirite has shaved off the hair that symbolizes their dedication, the priest is to place in their hands a boiled shoulder of the ram, and one thick loaf and one thin loaf from the basket, both made without yeast.
04006020 The priest shall then wave these before the Lord as a wave offering; they are holy and belong to the priest, together with the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented. After that, the Nazirite may drink wine.
04006021 “ ‘This is the law of the Nazirite who vows offerings to the Lord in accordance with their dedication, in addition to whatever else they can afford. They must fulfill the vows they have made, according to the law of the Nazirite.’ ”
04006022 The Lord said to Moses,
04006023 “Tell Aaron and his sons, ‘This is how you are to bless the Israelites. Say to them:
04006024 “ ‘ “The Lord bless you and keep you;
04006025 the Lord make his face shine on you and be gracious to you;
04006026 the Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.” ’
04006027 “So they will put my name on the Israelites, and I will bless them.”
04007001 When Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated it and all its furnishings. He also anointed and consecrated the altar and all its utensils.
04007002 Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of families who were the tribal leaders in charge of those who were counted, made offerings.
04007003 They brought as their gifts before the Lord six covered carts and twelve oxen—an ox from each leader and a cart from every two. These they presented before the tabernacle.
04007004 The Lord said to Moses,
04007005 “Accept these from them, that they may be used in the work at the tent of meeting. Give them to the Levites as each man’s work requires.”
04007006 So Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites.
04007007 He gave two carts and four oxen to the Gershonites, as their work required,
04007008 and he gave four carts and eight oxen to the Merarites, as their work required. They were all under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest.
04007009 But Moses did not give any to the Kohathites, because they were to carry on their shoulders the holy things, for which they were responsible.
04007010 When the altar was anointed, the leaders brought their offerings for its dedication and presented them before the altar.
04007011 For the Lord had said to Moses, “Each day one leader is to bring his offering for the dedication of the altar.”
04007012 The one who brought his offering on the first day was Nahshon son of Amminadab of the tribe of Judah.
04007013 His offering was one silver plate weighing a hundred and thirty shekels and one silver sprinkling bowl weighing seventy shekels, both according to the sanctuary shekel, each filled with the finest flour mixed with olive oil as a grain offering;

04007079 His offering was one silver plate weighing a hundred and thirty shekels and one silver sprinkling bowl weighing seventy shekels, both according to the sanctuary shekel, each filled with the finest flour mixed with olive oil as a grain offering;
04007080 one gold dish weighing ten shekels, filled with incense;
04007081 one young bull, one ram and one male lamb a year old for a burnt offering;
04007082 one male goat for a sin offering;
04007083 and two oxen, five rams, five male goats and five male lambs a year old to be sacrificed as a fellowship offering. This was the offering of Ahira son of Enan.
04007084 These were the offerings of the Israelite leaders for the dedication of the altar when it was anointed: twelve silver plates, twelve silver sprinkling bowls and twelve gold dishes.
04007085 Each silver plate weighed a hundred and thirty shekels, and each sprinkling bowl seventy shekels. Altogether, the silver dishes weighed two thousand four hundred shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.
04007086 The twelve gold dishes filled with incense weighed ten shekels each, according to the sanctuary shekel. Altogether, the gold dishes weighed a hundred and twenty shekels.
04007087 The total number of animals for the burnt offering came to twelve young bulls, twelve rams and twelve male lambs a year old, together with their grain offering. Twelve male goats were used for the sin offering.
04007088 The total number of animals for the sacrifice of the fellowship offering came to twenty-four oxen, sixty rams, sixty male goats and sixty male lambs a year old. These were the offerings for the dedication of the altar after it was anointed.
04007089 When Moses entered the tent of meeting to speak with the Lord, he heard the voice speaking to him from between the two cherubim above the atonement cover on the ark of the covenant law. In this way the Lord spoke to him.
04008001 The Lord said to Moses,
04008002 “Speak to Aaron and say to him, ‘When you set up the lamps, see that all seven light up the area in front of the lampstand.’ ”
04008003 Aaron did so; he set up the lamps so that they faced forward on the lampstand, just as the Lord commanded Moses.
04008004 This is how the lampstand was made: It was made of hammered gold—from its base to its blossoms. The lampstand was made exactly like the pattern the Lord had shown Moses.
04008005 The Lord said to Moses:
04008006 “Take the Levites from among all the Israelites and make them ceremonially clean.
04008007 To purify them, do this: Sprinkle the water of cleansing on them; then have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes. And so they will purify themselves.
04008008 Have them take a young bull with its grain offering of the finest flour mixed with olive oil; then you are to take a second young bull for a sin offering.
04008009 Bring the Levites to the front of the tent of meeting and assemble the whole Israelite community.
04008010 You are to bring the Levites before the Lord, and the Israelites are to lay their hands on them.
04008011 Aaron is to present the Levites before the Lord as a wave offering from the Israelites, so that they may be ready to do the work of the Lord.
04008012 “Then the Levites are to lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, using one for a sin offering to the Lord and the other for a burnt offering, to make atonement for the Levites.
04008013 Have the Levites stand in front of Aaron and his sons and then present them as a wave offering to the Lord.
04008014 In this way you are to set the Levites apart from the other Israelites, and the Levites will be mine.
04008015 “After you have purified the Levites and presented them as a wave offering, they are to come to do their work at the tent of meeting.
04008016 They are the Israelites who are to be given wholly to me. I have taken them as my own in place of the firstborn, the first male offspring from every Israelite woman.
04008017 Every firstborn male in Israel, whether human or animal, is mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set them apart for myself.
04008018 And I have taken the Levites in place of all the firstborn sons in Israel.
04008019 From among all the Israelites, I have given the Levites as gifts to Aaron and his sons to do the work at the tent of meeting on behalf of the Israelites and to make atonement for them so that no plague will strike the Israelites when they go near the sanctuary.”
04008020 Moses, Aaron and the whole Israelite community did with the Levites just as the Lord commanded Moses.
04008021 The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes. Then Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the Lord and made atonement for them to purify them.
04008022 After that, the Levites came to do their work at the tent of meeting under the supervision of Aaron and his sons. They did with the Levites just as the Lord commanded Moses.
04008023 The Lord said to Moses,
04008024 “This applies to the Levites: Men twenty-five years old or more shall come to take part in the work at the tent of meeting,
04008025 but at the age of fifty, they must retire from their regular service and work no longer.
04008026 They may assist their brothers in performing their duties at the tent of meeting, but they themselves must not do the work. This, then, is how you are to assign the responsibilities of the Levites.”
04009001 The Lord spoke to Moses in the Desert of Sinai in the first month of the second year after they came out of Egypt. He said,
04009002 “Have the Israelites celebrate the Passover at the appointed time.
04009003 Celebrate it at the appointed time, at twilight on the fourteenth day of this month, in accordance with all its rules and regulations.”
04009004 So Moses told the Israelites to celebrate the Passover,
04009005 and they did so in the Desert of Sinai at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month. The Israelites did everything just as the Lord commanded Moses.
04009006 But some of them could not celebrate the Passover on that day because they were ceremonially unclean on account of a dead body. So they came to Moses and Aaron that same day
04009007 and said to Moses, “We have become unclean because of a dead body, but why should we be kept from presenting the Lord’s offering with the other Israelites at the appointed time?”
04009008 Moses answered them, “Wait until I find out what the Lord commands concerning you.”
04009009 Then the Lord said to Moses,
04009010 “Tell the Israelites: ‘When any of you or your descendants are unclean because of a dead body or are away on a journey, they are still to celebrate the Lord’s Passover,
04009011 but they are to do it on the fourteenth day of the second month at twilight. They are to eat the lamb, together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
04009012 They must not leave any of it till morning or break any of its bones. When they celebrate the Passover, they must follow all the regulations.
04009013 But if anyone who is ceremonially clean and not on a journey fails to celebrate the Passover, they must be cut off from their people for not presenting the Lord’s offering at the appointed time. They will bear the consequences of their sin.
04009014 “ ‘A foreigner residing among you is also to celebrate the Lord’s Passover in accordance with its rules and regulations. You must have the same regulations for both the foreigner and the native-born.’ ”
04009015 On the day the tabernacle, the tent of the covenant law, was set up, the cloud covered it. From evening till morning the cloud above the tabernacle looked like fire.
04009016 That is how it continued to be; the cloud covered it, and at night it looked like fire.
04009017 Whenever the cloud lifted from above the tent, the Israelites set out; wherever the cloud settled, the Israelites encamped.
04009018 At the Lord’s command the Israelites set out, and at his command they encamped. As long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle, they remained in camp.
04009019 When the cloud remained over the tabernacle a long time, the Israelites obeyed the Lord’s order and did not set out.
04009020 Sometimes the cloud was over the tabernacle only a few days; at the Lord’s command they would encamp, and then at his command they would set out.
04009021 Sometimes the cloud stayed only from evening till morning, and when it lifted in the morning, they set out. Whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud lifted, they set out.
04009022 Whether the cloud stayed over the tabernacle for two days or a month or a year, the Israelites would remain in camp and not set out; but when it lifted, they would set out.
04009023 At the Lord’s command they encamped, and at the Lord’s command they set out. They obeyed the Lord’s order, in accordance with his command through Moses.
04010001 The Lord said to Moses:
04010002 “Make two trumpets of hammered silver, and use them for calling the community together and for having the camps set out.
04010003 When both are sounded, the whole community is to assemble before you at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
04010004 If only one is sounded, the leaders—the heads of the clans of Israel—are to assemble before you.
04010005 When a trumpet blast is sounded, the tribes camping on the east are to set out.
04010006 At the sounding of a second blast, the camps on the south are to set out. The blast will be the signal for setting out.
04010007 To gather the assembly, blow the trumpets, but not with the signal for setting out.
04010008 “The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to blow the trumpets. This is to be a lasting ordinance for you and the generations to come.
04010009 When you go into battle in your own land against an enemy who is oppressing you, sound a blast on the trumpets. Then you will be remembered by the Lord your God and rescued from your enemies.
04010010 Also at your times of rejoicing—your appointed festivals and New Moon feasts—you are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, and they will be a memorial for you before your God. I am the Lord your God.”
04010011 On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle of the covenant law.
04010012 Then the Israelites set out from the Desert of Sinai and traveled from place to place until the cloud came to rest in the Desert of Paran.
04010013 They set out, this first time, at the Lord’s command through Moses.
04010014 The divisions of the camp of Judah went first, under their standard. Nahshon son of Amminadab was in command.
04010015 Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of Issachar,
04010016 and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of Zebulun.
04010017 Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and Merarites, who carried it, set out.
04010018 The divisions of the camp of Reuben went next, under their standard. Elizur son of Shedeur was in command.
04010019 Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of Simeon,
04010020 and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad.
04010021 Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things. The tabernacle was to be set up before they arrived.
04010022 The divisions of the camp of Ephraim went next, under their standard. Elishama son of Ammihud was in command.
04010023 Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh,
04010024 and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin.
04010025 Finally, as the rear guard for all the units, the divisions of the camp of Dan set out under their standard. Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was in command.
04010026 Pagiel son of Okran was over the division of the tribe of Asher,
04010027 and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali.
04010028 This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out.
04010029 Now Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are setting out for the place about which the Lord said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us and we will treat you well, for the Lord has promised good things to Israel.”
04010030 He answered, “No, I will not go; I am going back to my own land and my own people.”
04010031 But Moses said, “Please do not leave us. You know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes.
04010032 If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the Lord gives us.”
04010033 So they set out from the mountain of the Lord and traveled for three days. The ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them during those three days to find them a place to rest.
04010034 The cloud of the Lord was over them by day when they set out from the camp.
04010035 Whenever the ark set out, Moses said, “Rise up, Lord! May your enemies be scattered; may your foes flee before you.”
04010036 Whenever it came to rest, he said, “Return, Lord, to the countless thousands of Israel.”
04011001 Now the people complained about their hardships in the hearing of the Lord, and when he heard them his anger was aroused. Then fire from the Lord burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp.
04011002 When the people cried out to Moses, he prayed to the Lord and the fire died down.
04011003 So that place was called Taberah, because fire from the Lord had burned among them.
04011004 The rabble with them began to crave other food, and again the Israelites started wailing and said, “If only we had meat to eat!
04011005 We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost—also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic.
04011006 But now we have lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!”
04011007 The manna was like coriander seed and looked like resin.
04011008 The people went around gathering it, and then ground it in a hand mill or crushed it in a mortar. They cooked it in a pot or made it into loaves. And it tasted like something made with olive oil.
04011009 When the dew settled on the camp at night, the manna also came down.
04011010 Moses heard the people of every family wailing at the entrance to their tents. The Lord became exceedingly angry, and Moses was troubled.
04011011 He asked the Lord, “Why have you brought this trouble on your servant? What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me?
04011012 Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries an infant, to the land you promised on oath to their ancestors?
04011013 Where can I get meat for all these people? They keep wailing to me, ‘Give us meat to eat!’
04011014 I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for me.
04011015 If this is how you are going to treat me, please go ahead and kill me—if I have found favor in your eyes—and do not let me face my own ruin.”
04011016 The Lord said to Moses: “Bring me seventy of Israel’s elders who are known to you as leaders and officials among the people. Have them come to the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with you.
04011017 I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the power of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them. They will share the burden of the people with you so that you will not have to carry it alone.
04011018 “Tell the people: ‘Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, when you will eat meat. The Lord heard you when you wailed, “If only we had meat to eat! We were better off in Egypt!” Now the Lord will give you meat, and you will eat it.
04011019 You will not eat it for just one day, or two days, or five, ten or twenty days,
04011020 but for a whole month—until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it—because you have rejected the Lord, who is among you, and have wailed before him, saying, “Why did we ever leave Egypt?” ’ ”
04011021 But Moses said, “Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot, and you say, ‘I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!’
04011022 Would they have enough if flocks and herds were slaughtered for them? Would they have enough if all the fish in the sea were caught for them?”
04011023 The Lord answered Moses, “Is the Lord’s arm too short? Now you will see whether or not what I say will come true for you.”
04011024 So Moses went out and told the people what the Lord had said. He brought together seventy of their elders and had them stand around the tent.
04011025 Then the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke with him, and he took some of the power of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied—but did not do so again.
04011026 However, two men, whose names were Eldad and Medad, had remained in the camp. They were listed among the elders, but did not go out to the tent. Yet the Spirit also rested on them, and they prophesied in the camp.
04011027 A young man ran and told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”
04011028 Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses’ aide since youth, spoke up and said, “Moses, my lord, stop them!”
04011029 But Moses replied, “Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the Lord’s people were prophets and that the Lord would put his Spirit on them!”
04011030 Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
04011031 Now a wind went out from the Lord and drove quail in from the sea. It scattered them up to two cubits deep all around the camp, as far as a day’s walk in any direction.
04011032 All that day and night and all the next day the people went out and gathered quail. No one gathered less than ten homers. Then they spread them out all around the camp.
04011033 But while the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be consumed, the anger of the Lord burned against the people, and he struck them with a severe plague.
04011034 Therefore the place was named Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had craved other food.
04011035 From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth and stayed there.
04012001 Miriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses because of his Cushite wife, for he had married a Cushite.
04012002 “Has the Lord spoken only through Moses?” they asked. “Hasn’t he also spoken through us?” And the Lord heard this.
04012003 (Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.)
04012004 At once the Lord said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, “Come out to the tent of meeting, all three of you.” So the three of them went out.
04012005 Then the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud; he stood at the entrance to the tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When the two of them stepped forward,
04012006 he said, “Listen to my words: “When there is a prophet among you, I, the Lord, reveal myself to them in visions, I speak to them in dreams.
04012007 But this is not true of my servant Moses; he is faithful in all my house.
04012008 With him I speak face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the Lord. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?”
04012009 The anger of the Lord burned against them, and he left them.
04012010 When the cloud lifted from above the tent, Miriam’s skin was leprous —it became as white as snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw that she had a defiling skin disease,
04012011 and he said to Moses, “Please, my lord, I ask you not to hold against us the sin we have so foolishly committed.
04012012 Do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mother’s womb with its flesh half eaten away.”
04012013 So Moses cried out to the Lord, “Please, God, heal her!”
04012014 The Lord replied to Moses, “If her father had spit in her face, would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Confine her outside the camp for seven days; after that she can be brought back.”
04012015 So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on till she was brought back.
04012016 After that, the people left Hazeroth and encamped in the Desert of Paran.
04013001 The Lord said to Moses,
04013002 “Send some men to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites. From each ancestral tribe send one of its leaders.”
04013003 So at the Lord’s command Moses sent them out from the Desert of Paran. All of them were leaders of the Israelites.
04013004 These are their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zakkur;
04013005 from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori;
04013006 from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;
04013007 from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph;
04013008 from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun;
04013009 from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu;
04013010 from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi;
04013011 from the tribe of Manasseh (a tribe of Joseph), Gaddi son of Susi;
04013012 from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli;
04013013 from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael;
04013014 from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi;
04013015 from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Maki.
04013016 These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land. (Moses gave Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua.)
04013017 When Moses sent them to explore Canaan, he said, “Go up through the Negev and on into the hill country.
04013018 See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many.
04013019 What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What kind of towns do they live in? Are they unwalled or fortified?
04013020 How is the soil? Is it fertile or poor? Are there trees in it or not? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land.” (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.)
04013021 So they went up and explored the land from the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob, toward Lebo Hamath.
04013022 They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, lived. (Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
04013023 When they reached the Valley of Eshkol, they cut off a branch bearing a single cluster of grapes. Two of them carried it on a pole between them, along with some pomegranates and figs.
04013024 That place was called the Valley of Eshkol because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut off there.
04013025 At the end of forty days they returned from exploring the land.
04013026 They came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. There they reported to them and to the whole assembly and showed them the fruit of the land.
04013027 They gave Moses this account: “We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit.
04013028 But the people who live there are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw descendants of Anak there.
04013029 The Amalekites live in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan.”
04013030 Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, “We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it.”
04013031 But the men who had gone up with him said, “We can’t attack those people; they are stronger than we are.”
04013032 And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they had explored. They said, “The land we explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are of great size.
04013033 We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.”
04014001 That night all the members of the community raised their voices and wept aloud.
04014002 All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole assembly said to them, “If only we had died in Egypt! Or in this wilderness!
04014003 Why is the Lord bringing us to this land only to let us fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be taken as plunder. Wouldn’t it be better for us to go back to Egypt?”
04014004 And they said to each other, “We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt.”
04014005 Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown in front of the whole Israelite assembly gathered there.
04014006 Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had explored the land, tore their clothes
04014007 and said to the entire Israelite assembly, “The land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good.
04014008 If the Lord is pleased with us, he will lead us into that land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and will give it to us.
04014009 Only do not rebel against the Lord. And do not be afraid of the people of the land, because we will devour them. Their protection is gone, but the Lord is with us. Do not be afraid of them.”
04014010 But the whole assembly talked about stoning them. Then the glory of the Lord appeared at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites.
04014011 The Lord said to Moses, “How long will these people treat me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the signs I have performed among them?
04014012 I will strike them down with a plague and destroy them, but I will make you into a nation greater and stronger than they.”
04014013 Moses said to the Lord, “Then the Egyptians will hear about it! By your power you brought these people up from among them.
04014014 And they will tell the inhabitants of this land about it. They have already heard that you, Lord, are with these people and that you, Lord, have been seen face to face, that your cloud stays over them, and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.
04014015 If you put all these people to death, leaving none alive, the nations who have heard this report about you will say,
04014016 ‘The Lord was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath, so he slaughtered them in the wilderness.’
04014017 “Now may the Lord’s strength be displayed, just as you have declared:
04014018 ‘The Lord is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.’
04014019 In accordance with your great love, forgive the sin of these people, just as you have pardoned them from the time they left Egypt until now.”
04014020 The Lord replied, “I have forgiven them, as you asked.
04014021 Nevertheless, as surely as I live and as surely as the glory of the Lord fills the whole earth,
04014022 not one of those who saw my glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness but who disobeyed me and tested me ten times—
04014023 not one of them will ever see the land I promised on oath to their ancestors. No one who has treated me with contempt will ever see it.
04014024 But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he went to, and his descendants will inherit it.
04014025 Since the Amalekites and the Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn back tomorrow and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea. ”
04014026 The Lord said to Moses and Aaron:
04014027 “How long will this wicked community grumble against me? I have heard the complaints of these grumbling Israelites.
04014028 So tell them, ‘As surely as I live, declares the Lord, I will do to you the very thing I heard you say:
04014029 In this wilderness your bodies will fall—every one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me.
04014030 Not one of you will enter the land I swore with uplifted hand to make your home, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
04014031 As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected.
04014032 But as for you, your bodies will fall in this wilderness.
04014033 Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the wilderness.
04014034 For forty years—one year for each of the forty days you explored the land—you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you.’
04014035 I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this whole wicked community, which has banded together against me. They will meet their end in this wilderness; here they will die.”
04014036 So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it—
04014037 these men who were responsible for spreading the bad report about the land were struck down and died of a plague before the Lord.
04014038 Of the men who went to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived.
04014039 When Moses reported this to all the Israelites, they mourned bitterly.
04014040 Early the next morning they set out for the highest point in the hill country, saying, “Now we are ready to go up to the land the Lord promised. Surely we have sinned!”
04014041 But Moses said, “Why are you disobeying the Lord’s command? This will not succeed!
04014042 Do not go up, because the Lord is not with you. You will be defeated by your enemies,
04014043 for the Amalekites and the Canaanites will face you there. Because you have turned away from the Lord, he will not be with you and you will fall by the sword.”
04014044 Nevertheless, in their presumption they went up toward the highest point in the hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the Lord’s covenant moved from the camp.
04014045 Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down and attacked them and beat them down all the way to Hormah.
04015001 The Lord said to Moses,
04015002 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘After you enter the land I am giving you as a home
04015003 and you present to the Lord food offerings from the herd or the flock, as an aroma pleasing to the Lord—whether burnt offerings or sacrifices, for special vows or freewill offerings or festival offerings—
04015004 then the person who brings an offering shall present to the Lord a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of olive oil.
04015005 With each lamb for the burnt offering or the sacrifice, prepare a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink offering.
04015006 “ ‘With a ram prepare a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with a third of a hin of olive oil,
04015007 and a third of a hin of wine as a drink offering. Offer it as an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
04015008 “ ‘When you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice, for a special vow or a fellowship offering to the Lord,
04015009 bring with the bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with half a hin of olive oil,
04015010 and also bring half a hin of wine as a drink offering. This will be a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
04015011 Each bull or ram, each lamb or young goat, is to be prepared in this manner.
04015012 Do this for each one, for as many as you prepare.
04015013 “ ‘Everyone who is native-born must do these things in this way when they present a food offering as an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
04015014 For the generations to come, whenever a foreigner or anyone else living among you presents a food offering as an aroma pleasing to the Lord, they must do exactly as you do.
04015015 The community is to have the same rules for you and for the foreigner residing among you; this is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. You and the foreigner shall be the same before the Lord:
04015016 The same laws and regulations will apply both to you and to the foreigner residing among you.’ ”
04015017 The Lord said to Moses,
04015018 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When you enter the land to which I am taking you
04015019 and you eat the food of the land, present a portion as an offering to the Lord.
04015020 Present a loaf from the first of your ground meal and present it as an offering from the threshing floor.
04015021 Throughout the generations to come you are to give this offering to the Lord from the first of your ground meal.
04015022 “ ‘Now if you as a community unintentionally fail to keep any of these commands the Lord gave Moses—
04015023 any of the Lord’s commands to you through him, from the day the Lord gave them and continuing through the generations to come—
04015024 and if this is done unintentionally without the community being aware of it, then the whole community is to offer a young bull for a burnt offering as an aroma pleasing to the Lord, along with its prescribed grain offering and drink offering, and a male goat for a sin offering.
04015025 The priest is to make atonement for the whole Israelite community, and they will be forgiven, for it was not intentional and they have presented to the Lord for their wrong a food offering and a sin offering.
04015026 The whole Israelite community and the foreigners residing among them will be forgiven, because all the people were involved in the unintentional wrong.
04015027 “ ‘But if just one person sins unintentionally, that person must bring a year-old female goat for a sin offering.
04015028 The priest is to make atonement before the Lord for the one who erred by sinning unintentionally, and when atonement has been made, that person will be forgiven.
04015029 One and the same law applies to everyone who sins unintentionally, whether a native-born Israelite or a foreigner residing among you.
04015030 “ ‘But anyone who sins defiantly, whether native-born or foreigner, blasphemes the Lord and must be cut off from the people of Israel.
04015031 Because they have despised the Lord’s word and broken his commands, they must surely be cut off; their guilt remains on them.’ ”
04015032 While the Israelites were in the wilderness, a man was found gathering wood on the Sabbath day.
04015033 Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole assembly,
04015034 and they kept him in custody, because it was not clear what should be done to him.
04015035 Then the Lord said to Moses, “The man must die. The whole assembly must stone him outside the camp.”
04015036 So the assembly took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the Lord commanded Moses.
04015037 The Lord said to Moses,
04015038 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘Throughout the generations to come you are to make tassels on the corners of your garments, with a blue cord on each tassel.
04015039 You will have these tassels to look at and so you will remember all the commands of the Lord, that you may obey them and not prostitute yourselves by chasing after the lusts of your own hearts and eyes.
04015040 Then you will remember to obey all my commands and will be consecrated to your God.
04015041 I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am the Lord your God.’ ”
04016001 Korah son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and certain Reubenites—Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth—became insolent
04016002 and rose up against Moses. With them were 250 Israelite men, well-known community leaders who had been appointed members of the council.
04016003 They came as a group to oppose Moses and Aaron and said to them, “You have gone too far! The whole community is holy, every one of them, and the Lord is with them. Why then do you set yourselves above the Lord’s assembly?”
04016004 When Moses heard this, he fell facedown.
04016005 Then he said to Korah and all his followers: “In the morning the Lord will show who belongs to him and who is holy, and he will have that person come near him. The man he chooses he will cause to come near him.
04016006 You, Korah, and all your followers are to do this: Take censers
04016007 and tomorrow put burning coals and incense in them before the Lord. The man the Lord chooses will be the one who is holy. You Levites have gone too far!”
04016008 Moses also said to Korah, “Now listen, you Levites!
04016009 Isn’t it enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite community and brought you near himself to do the work at the Lord’s tabernacle and to stand before the community and minister to them?
04016010 He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near himself, but now you are trying to get the priesthood too.
04016011 It is against the Lord that you and all your followers have banded together. Who is Aaron that you should grumble against him?”
04016012 Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they said, “We will not come!
04016013 Isn’t it enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness? And now you also want to lord it over us!
04016014 Moreover, you haven’t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Do you want to treat these men like slaves ? No, we will not come!”
04016015 Then Moses became very angry and said to the Lord, “Do not accept their offering. I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, nor have I wronged any of them.”
04016016 Moses said to Korah, “You and all your followers are to appear before the Lord tomorrow—you and they and Aaron.
04016017 Each man is to take his censer and put incense in it—250 censers in all—and present it before the Lord. You and Aaron are to present your censers also.”
04016018 So each of them took his censer, put burning coals and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
04016019 When Korah had gathered all his followers in opposition to them at the entrance to the tent of meeting, the glory of the Lord appeared to the entire assembly.
04016020 The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
04016021 “Separate yourselves from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once.”
04016022 But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and cried out, “O God, the God who gives breath to all living things, will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins?”
04016023 Then the Lord said to Moses,
04016024 “Say to the assembly, ‘Move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.’ ”
04016025 Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.
04016026 He warned the assembly, “Move back from the tents of these wicked men! Do not touch anything belonging to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins.”
04016027 So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing with their wives, children and little ones at the entrances to their tents.
04016028 Then Moses said, “This is how you will know that the Lord has sent me to do all these things and that it was not my idea:
04016029 If these men die a natural death and suffer the fate of all mankind, then the Lord has not sent me.
04016030 But if the Lord brings about something totally new, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them, with everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the realm of the dead, then you will know that these men have treated the Lord with contempt.”
04016031 As soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split apart
04016032 and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their households, and all those associated with Korah, together with their possessions.
04016033 They went down alive into the realm of the dead, with everything they owned; the earth closed over them, and they perished and were gone from the community.
04016034 At their cries, all the Israelites around them fled, shouting, “The earth is going to swallow us too!”
04016035 And fire came out from the Lord and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense.
04016036 The Lord said to Moses,
04016037 “Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, to remove the censers from the charred remains and scatter the coals some distance away, for the censers are holy—
04016038 the censers of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives. Hammer the censers into sheets to overlay the altar, for they were presented before the Lord and have become holy. Let them be a sign to the Israelites.”
04016039 So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned to death, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar,
04016040 as the Lord directed him through Moses. This was to remind the Israelites that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn incense before the Lord, or he would become like Korah and his followers.
04016041 The next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. “You have killed the Lord’s people,” they said.
04016042 But when the assembly gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the tent of meeting, suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the Lord appeared.
04016043 Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the tent of meeting,
04016044 and the Lord said to Moses,
04016045 “Get away from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once.” And they fell facedown.
04016046 Then Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer and put incense in it, along with burning coals from the altar, and hurry to the assembly to make atonement for them. Wrath has come out from the Lord; the plague has started.”
04016047 So Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly. The plague had already started among the people, but Aaron offered the incense and made atonement for them.
04016048 He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague stopped.
04016049 But 14,700 people died from the plague, in addition to those who had died because of Korah.
04016050 Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting, for the plague had stopped.
04017001 The Lord said to Moses,
04017002 “Speak to the Israelites and get twelve staffs from them, one from the leader of each of their ancestral tribes. Write the name of each man on his staff.
04017003 On the staff of Levi write Aaron’s name, for there must be one staff for the head of each ancestral tribe.
04017004 Place them in the tent of meeting in front of the ark of the covenant law, where I meet with you.
04017005 The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid myself of this constant grumbling against you by the Israelites.”
04017006 So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and their leaders gave him twelve staffs, one for the leader of each of their ancestral tribes, and Aaron’s staff was among them.
04017007 Moses placed the staffs before the Lord in the tent of the covenant law.
04017008 The next day Moses entered the tent and saw that Aaron’s staff, which represented the tribe of Levi, had not only sprouted but had budded, blossomed and produced almonds.
04017009 Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the Lord’s presence to all the Israelites. They looked at them, and each of the leaders took his own staff.
04017010 The Lord said to Moses, “Put back Aaron’s staff in front of the ark of the covenant law, to be kept as a sign to the rebellious. This will put an end to their grumbling against me, so that they will not die.”
04017011 Moses did just as the Lord commanded him.
04017012 The Israelites said to Moses, “We will die! We are lost, we are all lost!
04017013 Anyone who even comes near the tabernacle of the Lord will die. Are we all going to die?”
04018001 The Lord said to Aaron, “You, your sons and your family are to bear the responsibility for offenses connected with the sanctuary, and you and your sons alone are to bear the responsibility for offenses connected with the priesthood.
04018002 Bring your fellow Levites from your ancestral tribe to join you and assist you when you and your sons minister before the tent of the covenant law.
04018003 They are to be responsible to you and are to perform all the duties of the tent, but they must not go near the furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar. Otherwise both they and you will die.
04018004 They are to join you and be responsible for the care of the tent of meeting—all the work at the tent—and no one else may come near where you are.
04018005 “You are to be responsible for the care of the sanctuary and the altar, so that my wrath will not fall on the Israelites again.
04018006 I myself have selected your fellow Levites from among the Israelites as a gift to you, dedicated to the Lord to do the work at the tent of meeting.
04018007 But only you and your sons may serve as priests in connection with everything at the altar and inside the curtain. I am giving you the service of the priesthood as a gift. Anyone else who comes near the sanctuary is to be put to death.”
04018008 Then the Lord said to Aaron, “I myself have put you in charge of the offerings presented to me; all the holy offerings the Israelites give me I give to you and your sons as your portion, your perpetual share.
04018009 You are to have the part of the most holy offerings that is kept from the fire. From all the gifts they bring me as most holy offerings, whether grain or sin or guilt offerings, that part belongs to you and your sons.
04018010 Eat it as something most holy; every male shall eat it. You must regard it as holy.
04018011 “This also is yours: whatever is set aside from the gifts of all the wave offerings of the Israelites. I give this to you and your sons and daughters as your perpetual share. Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it.
04018012 “I give you all the finest olive oil and all the finest new wine and grain they give the Lord as the firstfruits of their harvest.
04018013 All the land’s firstfruits that they bring to the Lord will be yours. Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it.
04018014 “Everything in Israel that is devoted to the Lord is yours.
04018015 The first offspring of every womb, both human and animal, that is offered to the Lord is yours. But you must redeem every firstborn son and every firstborn male of unclean animals.
04018016 When they are a month old, you must redeem them at the redemption price set at five shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs.
04018017 “But you must not redeem the firstborn of a cow, a sheep or a goat; they are holy. Splash their blood against the altar and burn their fat as a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
04018018 Their meat is to be yours, just as the breast of the wave offering and the right thigh are yours.
04018019 Whatever is set aside from the holy offerings the Israelites present to the Lord I give to you and your sons and daughters as your perpetual share. It is an everlasting covenant of salt before the Lord for both you and your offspring.”
04018020 The Lord said to Aaron, “You will have no inheritance in their land, nor will you have any share among them; I am your share and your inheritance among the Israelites.
04018021 “I give to the Levites all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance in return for the work they do while serving at the tent of meeting.
04018022 From now on the Israelites must not go near the tent of meeting, or they will bear the consequences of their sin and will die.
04018023 It is the Levites who are to do the work at the tent of meeting and bear the responsibility for any offenses they commit against it. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. They will receive no inheritance among the Israelites.
04018024 Instead, I give to the Levites as their inheritance the tithes that the Israelites present as an offering to the Lord. That is why I said concerning them: ‘They will have no inheritance among the Israelites.’ ”
04018025 The Lord said to Moses,
04018026 “Speak to the Levites and say to them: ‘When you receive from the Israelites the tithe I give you as your inheritance, you must present a tenth of that tithe as the Lord’s offering.
04018027 Your offering will be reckoned to you as grain from the threshing floor or juice from the winepress.
04018028 In this way you also will present an offering to the Lord from all the tithes you receive from the Israelites. From these tithes you must give the Lord’s portion to Aaron the priest.
04018029 You must present as the Lord’s portion the best and holiest part of everything given to you.’
04018030 “Say to the Levites: ‘When you present the best part, it will be reckoned to you as the product of the threshing floor or the winepress.
04018031 You and your households may eat the rest of it anywhere, for it is your wages for your work at the tent of meeting.
04018032 By presenting the best part of it you will not be guilty in this matter; then you will not defile the holy offerings of the Israelites, and you will not die.’ ”
04019001 The Lord said to Moses and Aaron:
04019002 “This is a requirement of the law that the Lord has commanded: Tell the Israelites to bring you a red heifer without defect or blemish and that has never been under a yoke.
04019003 Give it to Eleazar the priest; it is to be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence.
04019004 Then Eleazar the priest is to take some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the tent of meeting.
04019005 While he watches, the heifer is to be burned—its hide, flesh, blood and intestines.
04019006 The priest is to take some cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet wool and throw them onto the burning heifer.
04019007 After that, the priest must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water. He may then come into the camp, but he will be ceremonially unclean till evening.
04019008 The man who burns it must also wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he too will be unclean till evening.
04019009 “A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and put them in a ceremonially clean place outside the camp. They are to be kept by the Israelite community for use in the water of cleansing; it is for purification from sin.
04019010 The man who gathers up the ashes of the heifer must also wash his clothes, and he too will be unclean till evening. This will be a lasting ordinance both for the Israelites and for the foreigners residing among them.
04019011 “Whoever touches a human corpse will be unclean for seven days.
04019012 They must purify themselves with the water on the third day and on the seventh day; then they will be clean. But if they do not purify themselves on the third and seventh days, they will not be clean.
04019013 If they fail to purify themselves after touching a human corpse, they defile the Lord’s tabernacle. They must be cut off from Israel. Because the water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on them, they are unclean; their uncleanness remains on them.
04019014 “This is the law that applies when a person dies in a tent: Anyone who enters the tent and anyone who is in it will be unclean for seven days,
04019015 and every open container without a lid fastened on it will be unclean.
04019016 “Anyone out in the open who touches someone who has been killed with a sword or someone who has died a natural death, or anyone who touches a human bone or a grave, will be unclean for seven days.
04019017 “For the unclean person, put some ashes from the burned purification offering into a jar and pour fresh water over them.
04019018 Then a man who is ceremonially clean is to take some hyssop, dip it in the water and sprinkle the tent and all the furnishings and the people who were there. He must also sprinkle anyone who has touched a human bone or a grave or anyone who has been killed or anyone who has died a natural death.
04019019 The man who is clean is to sprinkle those who are unclean on the third and seventh days, and on the seventh day he is to purify them. Those who are being cleansed must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and that evening they will be clean.
04019020 But if those who are unclean do not purify themselves, they must be cut off from the community, because they have defiled the sanctuary of the Lord. The water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on them, and they are unclean.
04019021 This is a lasting ordinance for them. “The man who sprinkles the water of cleansing must also wash his clothes, and anyone who touches the water of cleansing will be unclean till evening.
04019022 Anything that an unclean person touches becomes unclean, and anyone who touches it becomes unclean till evening.”
04020001 In the first month the whole Israelite community arrived at the Desert of Zin, and they stayed at Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried.
04020002 Now there was no water for the community, and the people gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron.
04020003 They quarreled with Moses and said, “If only we had died when our brothers fell dead before the Lord!
04020004 Why did you bring the Lord’s community into this wilderness, that we and our livestock should die here?
04020005 Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to this terrible place? It has no grain or figs, grapevines or pomegranates. And there is no water to drink!”
04020006 Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance to the tent of meeting and fell facedown, and the glory of the Lord appeared to them.
04020007 The Lord said to Moses,
04020008 “Take the staff, and you and your brother Aaron gather the assembly together. Speak to that rock before their eyes and it will pour out its water. You will bring water out of the rock for the community so they and their livestock can drink.”
04020009 So Moses took the staff from the Lord’s presence, just as he commanded him.
04020010 He and Aaron gathered the assembly together in front of the rock and Moses said to them, “Listen, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?”
04020011 Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his staff. Water gushed out, and the community and their livestock drank.
04020012 But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not trust in me enough to honor me as holy in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this community into the land I give them.”
04020013 These were the waters of Meribah, where the Israelites quarreled with the Lord and where he was proved holy among them.
04020014 Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying: “This is what your brother Israel says: You know about all the hardships that have come on us.
04020015 Our ancestors went down into Egypt, and we lived there many years. The Egyptians mistreated us and our ancestors,
04020016 but when we cried out to the Lord, he heard our cry and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. “Now we are here at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory.
04020017 Please let us pass through your country. We will not go through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the King’s Highway and not turn to the right or to the left until we have passed through your territory.”
04020018 But Edom answered: “You may not pass through here; if you try, we will march out and attack you with the sword.”
04020019 The Israelites replied: “We will go along the main road, and if we or our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay for it. We only want to pass through on foot—nothing else.”
04020020 Again they answered: “You may not pass through.” Then Edom came out against them with a large and powerful army.
04020021 Since Edom refused to let them go through their territory, Israel turned away from them.
04020022 The whole Israelite community set out from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor.
04020023 At Mount Hor, near the border of Edom, the Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
04020024 “Aaron will be gathered to his people. He will not enter the land I give the Israelites, because both of you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah.
04020025 Get Aaron and his son Eleazar and take them up Mount Hor.
04020026 Remove Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar, for Aaron will be gathered to his people; he will die there.”
04020027 Moses did as the Lord commanded: They went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community.
04020028 Moses removed Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar. And Aaron died there on top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain,
04020029 and when the whole community learned that Aaron had died, all the Israelites mourned for him thirty days.
04021001 When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim, he attacked the Israelites and captured some of them.
04021002 Then Israel made this vow to the Lord: “If you will deliver these people into our hands, we will totally destroy their cities.”
04021003 The Lord listened to Israel’s plea and gave the Canaanites over to them. They completely destroyed them and their towns; so the place was named Hormah.
04021004 They traveled from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea, to go around Edom. But the people grew impatient on the way;
04021005 they spoke against God and against Moses, and said, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread! There is no water! And we detest this miserable food!”
04021006 Then the Lord sent venomous snakes among them; they bit the people and many Israelites died.
04021007 The people came to Moses and said, “We sinned when we spoke against the Lord and against you. Pray that the Lord will take the snakes away from us.” So Moses prayed for the people.
04021008 The Lord said to Moses, “Make a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live.”
04021009 So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, they lived.
04021010 The Israelites moved on and camped at Oboth.
04021011 Then they set out from Oboth and camped in Iye Abarim, in the wilderness that faces Moab toward the sunrise.
04021012 From there they moved on and camped in the Zered Valley.
04021013 They set out from there and camped alongside the Arnon, which is in the wilderness extending into Amorite territory. The Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
04021014 That is why the Book of the Wars of the Lord says: “. . . Zahab in Suphah and the ravines, the Arnon
04021015 and the slopes of the ravines that lead to the settlement of Ar and lie along the border of Moab.”
04021016 From there they continued on to Beer, the well where the Lord said to Moses, “Gather the people together and I will give them water.”
04021017 Then Israel sang this song: “Spring up, O well! Sing about it,
04021018 about the well that the princes dug, that the nobles of the people sank— the nobles with scepters and staffs.” Then they went from the wilderness to Mattanah,
04021019 from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
04021020 and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where the top of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland.
04021021 Israel sent messengers to say to Sihon king of the Amorites:
04021022 “Let us pass through your country. We will not turn aside into any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the King’s Highway until we have passed through your territory.”
04021023 But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. He mustered his entire army and marched out into the wilderness against Israel. When he reached Jahaz, he fought with Israel.
04021024 Israel, however, put him to the sword and took over his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, but only as far as the Ammonites, because their border was fortified.
04021025 Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and occupied them, including Heshbon and all its surrounding settlements.
04021026 Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken from him all his land as far as the Arnon.
04021027 That is why the poets say: “Come to Heshbon and let it be rebuilt; let Sihon’s city be restored.
04021028 “Fire went out from Heshbon, a blaze from the city of Sihon. It consumed Ar of Moab, the citizens of Arnon’s heights.
04021029 Woe to you, Moab! You are destroyed, people of Chemosh! He has given up his sons as fugitives and his daughters as captives to Sihon king of the Amorites.
04021030 “But we have overthrown them; Heshbon’s dominion has been destroyed all the way to Dibon. We have demolished them as far as Nophah, which extends to Medeba.”
04021031 So Israel settled in the land of the Amorites.
04021032 After Moses had sent spies to Jazer, the Israelites captured its surrounding settlements and drove out the Amorites who were there.
04021033 Then they turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan and his whole army marched out to meet them in battle at Edrei.
04021034 The Lord said to Moses, “Do not be afraid of him, for I have delivered him into your hands, along with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon.”
04021035 So they struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army, leaving them no survivors. And they took possession of his land.
04022001 Then the Israelites traveled to the plains of Moab and camped along the Jordan across from Jericho.
04022002 Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites,
04022003 and Moab was terrified because there were so many people. Indeed, Moab was filled with dread because of the Israelites.
04022004 The Moabites said to the elders of Midian, “This horde is going to lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.” So Balak son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time,
04022005 sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, who was at Pethor, near the Euphrates River, in his native land. Balak said: “A people has come out of Egypt; they cover the face of the land and have settled next to me.
04022006 Now come and put a curse on these people, because they are too powerful for me. Perhaps then I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. For I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed.”
04022007 The elders of Moab and Midian left, taking with them the fee for divination. When they came to Balaam, they told him what Balak had said.
04022008 “Spend the night here,” Balaam said to them, “and I will report back to you with the answer the Lord gives me.” So the Moabite officials stayed with him.
04022009 God came to Balaam and asked, “Who are these men with you?”
04022010 Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message:
04022011 ‘A people that has come out of Egypt covers the face of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps then I will be able to fight them and drive them away.’ ”
04022012 But God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them. You must not put a curse on those people, because they are blessed.”
04022013 The next morning Balaam got up and said to Balak’s officials, “Go back to your own country, for the Lord has refused to let me go with you.”
04022014 So the Moabite officials returned to Balak and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.”
04022015 Then Balak sent other officials, more numerous and more distinguished than the first.
04022016 They came to Balaam and said: “This is what Balak son of Zippor says: Do not let anything keep you from coming to me,
04022017 because I will reward you handsomely and do whatever you say. Come and put a curse on these people for me.”
04022018 But Balaam answered them, “Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could not do anything great or small to go beyond the command of the Lord my God.
04022019 Now spend the night here so that I can find out what else the Lord will tell me.”
04022020 That night God came to Balaam and said, “Since these men have come to summon you, go with them, but do only what I tell you.”
04022021 Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey and went with the Moabite officials.
04022022 But God was very angry when he went, and the angel of the Lord stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.
04022023 When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, it turned off the road into a field. Balaam beat it to get it back on the road.
04022024 Then the angel of the Lord stood in a narrow path through the vineyards, with walls on both sides.
04022025 When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, it pressed close to the wall, crushing Balaam’s foot against it. So he beat the donkey again.
04022026 Then the angel of the Lord moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, either to the right or to the left.
04022027 When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, it lay down under Balaam, and he was angry and beat it with his staff.
04022028 Then the Lord opened the donkey’s mouth, and it said to Balaam, “What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?”
04022029 Balaam answered the donkey, “You have made a fool of me! If only I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now.”
04022030 The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden, to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?” “No,” he said.
04022031 Then the Lord opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell facedown.
04022032 The angel of the Lord asked him, “Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? I have come here to oppose you because your path is a reckless one before me.
04022033 The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If it had not turned away, I would certainly have killed you by now, but I would have spared it.”
04022034 Balaam said to the angel of the Lord, “I have sinned. I did not realize you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now if you are displeased, I will go back.”
04022035 The angel of the Lord said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but speak only what I tell you.” So Balaam went with Balak’s officials.
04022036 When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite town on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory.
04022037 Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why didn’t you come to me? Am I really not able to reward you?”
04022038 “Well, I have come to you now,” Balaam replied. “But I can’t say whatever I please. I must speak only what God puts in my mouth.”
04022039 Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth.
04022040 Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and gave some to Balaam and the officials who were with him.
04022041 The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, and from there he could see the outskirts of the Israelite camp.
04023001 Balaam said, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”
04023002 Balak did as Balaam said, and the two of them offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
04023003 Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering while I go aside. Perhaps the Lord will come to meet with me. Whatever he reveals to me I will tell you.” Then he went off to a barren height.
04023004 God met with him, and Balaam said, “I have prepared seven altars, and on each altar I have offered a bull and a ram.”
04023005 The Lord put a word in Balaam’s mouth and said, “Go back to Balak and give him this word.”
04023006 So he went back to him and found him standing beside his offering, with all the Moabite officials.
04023007 Then Balaam spoke his message: “Balak brought me from Aram, the king of Moab from the eastern mountains. ‘Come,’ he said, ‘curse Jacob for me; come, denounce Israel.’
04023008 How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom the Lord has not denounced?
04023009 From the rocky peaks I see them, from the heights I view them. I see a people who live apart and do not consider themselves one of the nations.
04023010 Who can count the dust of Jacob or number even a fourth of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and may my final end be like theirs!”
04023011 Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but you have done nothing but bless them!”
04023012 He answered, “Must I not speak what the Lord puts in my mouth?”
04023013 Then Balak said to him, “Come with me to another place where you can see them; you will not see them all but only the outskirts of their camp. And from there, curse them for me.”
04023014 So he took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah, and there he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
04023015 Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering while I meet with him over there.”
04023016 The Lord met with Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said, “Go back to Balak and give him this word.”
04023017 So he went to him and found him standing beside his offering, with the Moabite officials. Balak asked him, “What did the Lord say?”
04023018 Then he spoke his message: “Arise, Balak, and listen; hear me, son of Zippor.
04023019 God is not human, that he should lie, not a human being, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill?
04023020 I have received a command to bless; he has blessed, and I cannot change it.
04023021 “No misfortune is seen in Jacob, no misery observed in Israel. The Lord their God is with them; the shout of the King is among them.
04023022 God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox.
04023023 There is no divination against Jacob, no evil omens against Israel. It will now be said of Jacob and of Israel, ‘See what God has done!’
04023024 The people rise like a lioness; they rouse themselves like a lion that does not rest till it devours its prey and drinks the blood of its victims.”
04023025 Then Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!”
04023026 Balaam answered, “Did I not tell you I must do whatever the Lord says?”
04023027 Then Balak said to Balaam, “Come, let me take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there.”
04023028 And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland.
04023029 Balaam said, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”
04023030 Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
04024001 Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he did not resort to divination as at other times, but turned his face toward the wilderness.
04024002 When Balaam looked out and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came on him
04024003 and he spoke his message: “The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor, the prophecy of one whose eye sees clearly,
04024004 the prophecy of one who hears the words of God, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened:
04024005 “How beautiful are your tents, Jacob, your dwelling places, Israel!
04024006 “Like valleys they spread out, like gardens beside a river, like aloes planted by the Lord, like cedars beside the waters.
04024007 Water will flow from their buckets; their seed will have abundant water. “Their king will be greater than Agag; their kingdom will be exalted.
04024008 “God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox. They devour hostile nations and break their bones in pieces; with their arrows they pierce them.
04024009 Like a lion they crouch and lie down, like a lioness—who dares to rouse them? “May those who bless you be blessed and those who curse you be cursed!”
04024010 Then Balak’s anger burned against Balaam. He struck his hands together and said to him, “I summoned you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them these three times.
04024011 Now leave at once and go home! I said I would reward you handsomely, but the Lord has kept you from being rewarded.”
04024012 Balaam answered Balak, “Did I not tell the messengers you sent me,
04024013 ‘Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could not do anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of the Lord—and I must say only what the Lord says’?
04024014 Now I am going back to my people, but come, let me warn you of what this people will do to your people in days to come.”
04024015 Then he spoke his message: “The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor, the prophecy of one whose eye sees clearly,
04024016 the prophecy of one who hears the words of God, who has knowledge from the Most High, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened:
04024017 “I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob; a scepter will rise out of Israel. He will crush the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of all the people of Sheth.
04024018 Edom will be conquered; Seir, his enemy, will be conquered, but Israel will grow strong.
04024019 A ruler will come out of Jacob and destroy the survivors of the city.”
04024020 Then Balaam saw Amalek and spoke his message: “Amalek was first among the nations, but their end will be utter destruction.”
04024021 Then he saw the Kenites and spoke his message: “Your dwelling place is secure, your nest is set in a rock;
04024022 yet you Kenites will be destroyed when Ashur takes you captive.”
04024023 Then he spoke his message: “Alas! Who can live when God does this?
04024024 Ships will come from the shores of Cyprus; they will subdue Ashur and Eber, but they too will come to ruin.”
04024025 Then Balaam got up and returned home, and Balak went his own way.
04025001 While Israel was staying in Shittim, the men began to indulge in sexual immorality with Moabite women,
04025002 who invited them to the sacrifices to their gods. The people ate the sacrificial meal and bowed down before these gods.
04025003 So Israel yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor. And the Lord’s anger burned against them.
04025004 The Lord said to Moses, “Take all the leaders of these people, kill them and expose them in broad daylight before the Lord, so that the Lord’s fierce anger may turn away from Israel.”
04025005 So Moses said to Israel’s judges, “Each of you must put to death those of your people who have yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor.”
04025006 Then an Israelite man brought into the camp a Midianite woman right before the eyes of Moses and the whole assembly of Israel while they were weeping at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
04025007 When Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, saw this, he left the assembly, took a spear in his hand
04025008 and followed the Israelite into the tent. He drove the spear into both of them, right through the Israelite man and into the woman’s stomach. Then the plague against the Israelites was stopped;
04025009 but those who died in the plague numbered 24,000.
04025010 The Lord said to Moses,
04025011 “Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, has turned my anger away from the Israelites. Since he was as zealous for my honor among them as I am, I did not put an end to them in my zeal.
04025012 Therefore tell him I am making my covenant of peace with him.
04025013 He and his descendants will have a covenant of a lasting priesthood, because he was zealous for the honor of his God and made atonement for the Israelites.”
04025014 The name of the Israelite who was killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a Simeonite family.
04025015 And the name of the Midianite woman who was put to death was Kozbi daughter of Zur, a tribal chief of a Midianite family.
04025016 The Lord said to Moses,
04025017 “Treat the Midianites as enemies and kill them.
04025018 They treated you as enemies when they deceived you in the Peor incident involving their sister Kozbi, the daughter of a Midianite leader, the woman who was killed when the plague came as a result of that incident.”
04026001 After the plague the Lord said to Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest,
04026002 “Take a census of the whole Israelite community by families—all those twenty years old or more who are able to serve in the army of Israel.”
04026003 So on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them and said,
04026004 “Take a census of the men twenty years old or more, as the Lord commanded Moses.” These were the Israelites who came out of Egypt:
04026005 The descendants of Reuben, the firstborn son of Israel, were: through Hanok, the Hanokite clan; through Pallu, the Palluite clan;
04026006 through Hezron, the Hezronite clan; through Karmi, the Karmite clan.
04026007 These were the clans of Reuben; those numbered were 43,730.
04026008 The son of Pallu was Eliab,
04026009 and the sons of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan and Abiram. The same Dathan and Abiram were the community officials who rebelled against Moses and Aaron and were among Korah’s followers when they rebelled against the Lord.
04026010 The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them along with Korah, whose followers died when the fire devoured the 250 men. And they served as a warning sign.
04026011 The line of Korah, however, did not die out.
04026012 The descendants of Simeon by their clans were: through Nemuel, the Nemuelite clan; through Jamin, the Jaminite clan; through Jakin, the Jakinite clan;
04026013 through Zerah, the Zerahite clan; through Shaul, the Shaulite clan.
04026014 These were the clans of Simeon; those numbered were 22,200.

04026018 These were the clans of Gad; those numbered were 40,500.
04026019 Er and Onan were sons of Judah, but they died in Canaan.
04026020 The descendants of Judah by their clans were: through Shelah, the Shelanite clan; through Perez, the Perezite clan; through Zerah, the Zerahite clan.
04026021 The descendants of Perez were: through Hezron, the Hezronite clan; through Hamul, the Hamulite clan.

04026024 through Jashub, the Jashubite clan; through Shimron, the Shimronite clan.
04026025 These were the clans of Issachar; those numbered were 64,300.
04026026 The descendants of Zebulun by their clans were: through Sered, the Seredite clan; through Elon, the Elonite clan; through Jahleel, the Jahleelite clan.
04026027 These were the clans of Zebulun; those numbered were 60,500.
04026028 The descendants of Joseph by their clans through Manasseh and Ephraim were:
04026029 The descendants of Manasseh: through Makir, the Makirite clan (Makir was the father of Gilead); through Gilead, the Gileadite clan.
04026030 These were the descendants of Gilead: through Iezer, the Iezerite clan; through Helek, the Helekite clan;
04026031 through Asriel, the Asrielite clan; through Shechem, the Shechemite clan;
04026032 through Shemida, the Shemidaite clan; through Hepher, the Hepherite clan.
04026033 (Zelophehad son of Hepher had no sons; he had only daughters, whose names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milkah and Tirzah.)
04026034 These were the clans of Manasseh; those numbered were 52,700.
04026035 These were the descendants of Ephraim by their clans: through Shuthelah, the Shuthelahite clan; through Beker, the Bekerite clan; through Tahan, the Tahanite clan.
04026036 These were the descendants of Shuthelah: through Eran, the Eranite clan.
04026037 These were the clans of Ephraim; those numbered were 32,500. These were the descendants of Joseph by their clans.
04026038 The descendants of Benjamin by their clans were: through Bela, the Belaite clan; through Ashbel, the Ashbelite clan; through Ahiram, the Ahiramite clan;
04026039 through Shupham, the Shuphamite clan; through Hupham, the Huphamite clan.
04026040 The descendants of Bela through Ard and Naaman were: through Ard, the Ardite clan; through Naaman, the Naamite clan.
04026041 These were the clans of Benjamin; those numbered were 45,600.
04026042 These were the descendants of Dan by their clans: through Shuham, the Shuhamite clan. These were the clans of Dan:
04026043 All of them were Shuhamite clans; and those numbered were 64,400.
04026044 The descendants of Asher by their clans were: through Imnah, the Imnite clan; through Ishvi, the Ishvite clan; through Beriah, the Beriite clan;
04026045 and through the descendants of Beriah: through Heber, the Heberite clan; through Malkiel, the Malkielite clan.
04026046 (Asher had a daughter named Serah.)
04026047 These were the clans of Asher; those numbered were 53,400.
04026048 The descendants of Naphtali by their clans were: through Jahzeel, the Jahzeelite clan; through Guni, the Gunite clan;
04026049 through Jezer, the Jezerite clan; through Shillem, the Shillemite clan.
04026050 These were the clans of Naphtali; those numbered were 45,400.
04026051 The total number of the men of Israel was 601,730.
04026052 The Lord said to Moses,
04026053 “The land is to be allotted to them as an inheritance based on the number of names.
04026054 To a larger group give a larger inheritance, and to a smaller group a smaller one; each is to receive its inheritance according to the number of those listed.
04026055 Be sure that the land is distributed by lot. What each group inherits will be according to the names for its ancestral tribe.
04026056 Each inheritance is to be distributed by lot among the larger and smaller groups.”
04026057 These were the Levites who were counted by their clans: through Gershon, the Gershonite clan; through Kohath, the Kohathite clan; through Merari, the Merarite clan.
04026058 These also were Levite clans: the Libnite clan, the Hebronite clan, the Mahlite clan, the Mushite clan, the Korahite clan. (Kohath was the forefather of Amram;
04026059 the name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, a descendant of Levi, who was born to the Levites in Egypt. To Amram she bore Aaron, Moses and their sister Miriam.
04026060 Aaron was the father of Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
04026061 But Nadab and Abihu died when they made an offering before the Lord with unauthorized fire.)
04026062 All the male Levites a month old or more numbered 23,000. They were not counted along with the other Israelites because they received no inheritance among them.
04026063 These are the ones counted by Moses and Eleazar the priest when they counted the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.
04026064 Not one of them was among those counted by Moses and Aaron the priest when they counted the Israelites in the Desert of Sinai.
04026065 For the Lord had told those Israelites they would surely die in the wilderness, and not one of them was left except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
04027001 The daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, belonged to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph. The names of the daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milkah and Tirzah. They came forward
04027002 and stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders and the whole assembly at the entrance to the tent of meeting and said,
04027003 “Our father died in the wilderness. He was not among Korah’s followers, who banded together against the Lord, but he died for his own sin and left no sons.
04027004 Why should our father’s name disappear from his clan because he had no son? Give us property among our father’s relatives.”
04027005 So Moses brought their case before the Lord,
04027006 and the Lord said to him,
04027007 “What Zelophehad’s daughters are saying is right. You must certainly give them property as an inheritance among their father’s relatives and give their father’s inheritance to them.
04027008 “Say to the Israelites, ‘If a man dies and leaves no son, give his inheritance to his daughter.
04027009 If he has no daughter, give his inheritance to his brothers.
04027010 If he has no brothers, give his inheritance to his father’s brothers.
04027011 If his father had no brothers, give his inheritance to the nearest relative in his clan, that he may possess it. This is to have the force of law for the Israelites, as the Lord commanded Moses.’ ”
04027012 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go up this mountain in the Abarim Range and see the land I have given the Israelites.
04027013 After you have seen it, you too will be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was,
04027014 for when the community rebelled at the waters in the Desert of Zin, both of you disobeyed my command to honor me as holy before their eyes.” (These were the waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the Desert of Zin.)
04027015 Moses said to the Lord,
04027016 “May the Lord, the God who gives breath to all living things, appoint someone over this community
04027017 to go out and come in before them, one who will lead them out and bring them in, so the Lord’s people will not be like sheep without a shepherd.”
04027018 So the Lord said to Moses, “Take Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit of leadership, and lay your hand on him.
04027019 Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and the entire assembly and commission him in their presence.
04027020 Give him some of your authority so the whole Israelite community will obey him.
04027021 He is to stand before Eleazar the priest, who will obtain decisions for him by inquiring of the Urim before the Lord. At his command he and the entire community of the Israelites will go out, and at his command they will come in.”
04027022 Moses did as the Lord commanded him. He took Joshua and had him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole assembly.
04027023 Then he laid his hands on him and commissioned him, as the Lord instructed through Moses.
04028001 The Lord said to Moses,
04028002 “Give this command to the Israelites and say to them: ‘Make sure that you present to me at the appointed time my food offerings, as an aroma pleasing to me.’
04028003 Say to them: ‘This is the food offering you are to present to the Lord: two lambs a year old without defect, as a regular burnt offering each day.
04028004 Offer one lamb in the morning and the other at twilight,
04028005 together with a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil from pressed olives.
04028006 This is the regular burnt offering instituted at Mount Sinai as a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the Lord.
04028007 The accompanying drink offering is to be a quarter of a hin of fermented drink with each lamb. Pour out the drink offering to the Lord at the sanctuary.
04028008 Offer the second lamb at twilight, along with the same kind of grain offering and drink offering that you offer in the morning. This is a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
04028009 “ ‘On the Sabbath day, make an offering of two lambs a year old without defect, together with its drink offering and a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with olive oil.
04028010 This is the burnt offering for every Sabbath, in addition to the regular burnt offering and its drink offering.
04028011 “ ‘On the first of every month, present to the Lord a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram and seven male lambs a year old, all without defect.
04028012 With each bull there is to be a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with oil; with the ram, a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with oil;
04028013 and with each lamb, a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with oil. This is for a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the Lord.
04028014 With each bull there is to be a drink offering of half a hin of wine; with the ram, a third of a hin ; and with each lamb, a quarter of a hin. This is the monthly burnt offering to be made at each new moon during the year.
04028015 Besides the regular burnt offering with its drink offering, one male goat is to be presented to the Lord as a sin offering.
04028016 “ ‘On the fourteenth day of the first month the Lord’s Passover is to be held.
04028017 On the fifteenth day of this month there is to be a festival; for seven days eat bread made without yeast.
04028018 On the first day hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.
04028019 Present to the Lord a food offering consisting of a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram and seven male lambs a year old, all without defect.
04028020 With each bull offer a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with oil; with the ram, two-tenths;
04028021 and with each of the seven lambs, one-tenth.
04028022 Include one male goat as a sin offering to make atonement for you.
04028023 Offer these in addition to the regular morning burnt offering.
04028024 In this way present the food offering every day for seven days as an aroma pleasing to the Lord; it is to be offered in addition to the regular burnt offering and its drink offering.
04028025 On the seventh day hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.
04028026 “ ‘On the day of firstfruits, when you present to the Lord an offering of new grain during the Festival of Weeks, hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.
04028027 Present a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram and seven male lambs a year old as an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
04028028 With each bull there is to be a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with oil; with the ram, two-tenths;
04028029 and with each of the seven lambs, one-tenth.
04028030 Include one male goat to make atonement for you.
04028031 Offer these together with their drink offerings, in addition to the regular burnt offering and its grain offering. Be sure the animals are without defect.
04029001 “ ‘On the first day of the seventh month hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work. It is a day for you to sound the trumpets.
04029002 As an aroma pleasing to the Lord, offer a burnt offering of one young bull, one ram and seven male lambs a year old, all without defect.
04029003 With the bull offer a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with olive oil; with the ram, two-tenths ;
04029004 and with each of the seven lambs, one-tenth.
04029005 Include one male goat as a sin offering to make atonement for you.
04029006 These are in addition to the monthly and daily burnt offerings with their grain offerings and drink offerings as specified. They are food offerings presented to the Lord, a pleasing aroma.
04029007 “ ‘On the tenth day of this seventh month hold a sacred assembly. You must deny yourselves and do no work.
04029008 Present as an aroma pleasing to the Lord a burnt offering of one young bull, one ram and seven male lambs a year old, all without defect.
04029009 With the bull offer a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with oil; with the ram, two-tenths;
04029010 and with each of the seven lambs, one-tenth.
04029011 Include one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the sin offering for atonement and the regular burnt offering with its grain offering, and their drink offerings.
04029012 “ ‘On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work. Celebrate a festival to the Lord for seven days.
04029013 Present as an aroma pleasing to the Lord a food offering consisting of a burnt offering of thirteen young bulls, two rams and fourteen male lambs a year old, all without defect.
04029014 With each of the thirteen bulls offer a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with oil; with each of the two rams, two-tenths;
04029015 and with each of the fourteen lambs, one-tenth.
04029016 Include one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain offering and drink offering.
04029017 “ ‘On the second day offer twelve young bulls, two rams and fourteen male lambs a year old, all without defect.
04029018 With the bulls, rams and lambs, offer their grain offerings and drink offerings according to the number specified.
04029019 Include one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain offering, and their drink offerings.
04029020 “ ‘On the third day offer eleven bulls, two rams and fourteen male lambs a year old, all without defect.
04029021 With the bulls, rams and lambs, offer their grain offerings and drink offerings according to the number specified.
04029022 Include one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain offering and drink offering.
04029023 “ ‘On the fourth day offer ten bulls, two rams and fourteen male lambs a year old, all without defect.
04029024 With the bulls, rams and lambs, offer their grain offerings and drink offerings according to the number specified.
04029025 Include one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain offering and drink offering.

04029028 Include one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain offering and drink offering.
04029029 “ ‘On the sixth day offer eight bulls, two rams and fourteen male lambs a year old, all without defect.
04029030 With the bulls, rams and lambs, offer their grain offerings and drink offerings according to the number specified.
04029031 Include one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain offering and drink offering.

04029035 “ ‘On the eighth day hold a closing special assembly and do no regular work.
04029036 Present as an aroma pleasing to the Lord a food offering consisting of a burnt offering of one bull, one ram and seven male lambs a year old, all without defect.

04029038 Include one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain offering and drink offering.
04029039 “ ‘In addition to what you vow and your freewill offerings, offer these to the Lord at your appointed festivals: your burnt offerings, grain offerings, drink offerings and fellowship offerings.’ ”
04029040 Moses told the Israelites all that the Lord commanded him.
04030001 Moses said to the heads of the tribes of Israel: “This is what the Lord commands:
04030002 When a man makes a vow to the Lord or takes an oath to obligate himself by a pledge, he must not break his word but must do everything he said.
04030003 “When a young woman still living in her father’s household makes a vow to the Lord or obligates herself by a pledge
04030004 and her father hears about her vow or pledge but says nothing to her, then all her vows and every pledge by which she obligated herself will stand.
04030005 But if her father forbids her when he hears about it, none of her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand; the Lord will release her because her father has forbidden her.
04030006 “If she marries after she makes a vow or after her lips utter a rash promise by which she obligates herself
04030007 and her husband hears about it but says nothing to her, then her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand.
04030008 But if her husband forbids her when he hears about it, he nullifies the vow that obligates her or the rash promise by which she obligates herself, and the Lord will release her.
04030009 “Any vow or obligation taken by a widow or divorced woman will be binding on her.
04030010 “If a woman living with her husband makes a vow or obligates herself by a pledge under oath
04030011 and her husband hears about it but says nothing to her and does not forbid her, then all her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand.
04030012 But if her husband nullifies them when he hears about them, then none of the vows or pledges that came from her lips will stand. Her husband has nullified them, and the Lord will release her.
04030013 Her husband may confirm or nullify any vow she makes or any sworn pledge to deny herself.
04030014 But if her husband says nothing to her about it from day to day, then he confirms all her vows or the pledges binding on her. He confirms them by saying nothing to her when he hears about them.
04030015 If, however, he nullifies them some time after he hears about them, then he must bear the consequences of her wrongdoing.”
04030016 These are the regulations the Lord gave Moses concerning relationships between a man and his wife, and between a father and his young daughter still living at home.
04031001 The Lord said to Moses,
04031002 “Take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites. After that, you will be gathered to your people.”
04031003 So Moses said to the people, “Arm some of your men to go to war against the Midianites so that they may carry out the Lord’s vengeance on them.
04031004 Send into battle a thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel.”
04031005 So twelve thousand men armed for battle, a thousand from each tribe, were supplied from the clans of Israel.
04031006 Moses sent them into battle, a thousand from each tribe, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, who took with him articles from the sanctuary and the trumpets for signaling.
04031007 They fought against Midian, as the Lord commanded Moses, and killed every man.
04031008 Among their victims were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba—the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.
04031009 The Israelites captured the Midianite women and children and took all the Midianite herds, flocks and goods as plunder.
04031010 They burned all the towns where the Midianites had settled, as well as all their camps.
04031011 They took all the plunder and spoils, including the people and animals,
04031012 and brought the captives, spoils and plunder to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the Israelite assembly at their camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from Jericho.
04031013 Moses, Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp.
04031014 Moses was angry with the officers of the army—the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds—who returned from the battle.
04031015 “Have you allowed all the women to live?” he asked them.
04031016 “They were the ones who followed Balaam’s advice and enticed the Israelites to be unfaithful to the Lord in the Peor incident, so that a plague struck the Lord’s people.
04031017 Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man,
04031018 but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man.
04031019 “Anyone who has killed someone or touched someone who was killed must stay outside the camp seven days. On the third and seventh days you must purify yourselves and your captives.
04031020 Purify every garment as well as everything made of leather, goat hair or wood.”
04031021 Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle, “This is what is required by the law that the Lord gave Moses:
04031022 Gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, lead
04031023 and anything else that can withstand fire must be put through the fire, and then it will be clean. But it must also be purified with the water of cleansing. And whatever cannot withstand fire must be put through that water.
04031024 On the seventh day wash your clothes and you will be clean. Then you may come into the camp.”
04031025 The Lord said to Moses,
04031026 “You and Eleazar the priest and the family heads of the community are to count all the people and animals that were captured.
04031027 Divide the spoils equally between the soldiers who took part in the battle and the rest of the community.
04031028 From the soldiers who fought in the battle, set apart as tribute for the Lord one out of every five hundred, whether people, cattle, donkeys or sheep.
04031029 Take this tribute from their half share and give it to Eleazar the priest as the Lord’s part.
04031030 From the Israelites’ half, select one out of every fifty, whether people, cattle, donkeys, sheep or other animals. Give them to the Levites, who are responsible for the care of the Lord’s tabernacle.”
04031031 So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses.
04031032 The plunder remaining from the spoils that the soldiers took was 675,000 sheep,
04031033 72,000 cattle,
04031034 61,000 donkeys
04031035 and 32,000 women who had never slept with a man.
04031036 The half share of those who fought in the battle was: 337,500 sheep,
04031037 of which the tribute for the Lord was 675;
04031038 36,000 cattle, of which the tribute for the Lord was 72;
04031039 30,500 donkeys, of which the tribute for the Lord was 61;
04031040 16,000 people, of whom the tribute for the Lord was 32.
04031041 Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar the priest as the Lord’s part, as the Lord commanded Moses.
04031042 The half belonging to the Israelites, which Moses set apart from that of the fighting men—
04031043 the community’s half—was 337,500 sheep,
04031044 36,000 cattle,
04031045 30,500 donkeys
04031046 and 16,000 people.
04031047 From the Israelites’ half, Moses selected one out of every fifty people and animals, as the Lord commanded him, and gave them to the Levites, who were responsible for the care of the Lord’s tabernacle.
04031048 Then the officers who were over the units of the army—the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds—went to Moses
04031049 and said to him, “Your servants have counted the soldiers under our command, and not one is missing.
04031050 So we have brought as an offering to the Lord the gold articles each of us acquired—armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces—to make atonement for ourselves before the Lord.”
04031051 Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted from them the gold—all the crafted articles.
04031052 All the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds that Moses and Eleazar presented as a gift to the Lord weighed 16,750 shekels.
04031053 Each soldier had taken plunder for himself.
04031054 Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the Lord.
04032001 The Reubenites and Gadites, who had very large herds and flocks, saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were suitable for livestock.
04032002 So they came to Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community, and said,
04032003 “Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon—
04032004 the land the Lord subdued before the people of Israel—are suitable for livestock, and your servants have livestock.
04032005 If we have found favor in your eyes,” they said, “let this land be given to your servants as our possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan.”
04032006 Moses said to the Gadites and Reubenites, “Should your fellow Israelites go to war while you sit here?
04032007 Why do you discourage the Israelites from crossing over into the land the Lord has given them?
04032008 This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look over the land.
04032009 After they went up to the Valley of Eshkol and viewed the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land the Lord had given them.
04032010 The Lord’s anger was aroused that day and he swore this oath:
04032011 ‘Because they have not followed me wholeheartedly, not one of those who were twenty years old or more when they came up out of Egypt will see the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—
04032012 not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, for they followed the Lord wholeheartedly.’
04032013 The Lord’s anger burned against Israel and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the whole generation of those who had done evil in his sight was gone.
04032014 “And here you are, a brood of sinners, standing in the place of your fathers and making the Lord even more angry with Israel.
04032015 If you turn away from following him, he will again leave all this people in the wilderness, and you will be the cause of their destruction.”
04032016 Then they came up to him and said, “We would like to build pens here for our livestock and cities for our women and children.
04032017 But we will arm ourselves for battle and go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them to their place. Meanwhile our women and children will live in fortified cities, for protection from the inhabitants of the land.
04032018 We will not return to our homes until each of the Israelites has received their inheritance.
04032019 We will not receive any inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan, because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the Jordan.”
04032020 Then Moses said to them, “If you will do this—if you will arm yourselves before the Lord for battle
04032021 and if all of you who are armed cross over the Jordan before the Lord until he has driven his enemies out before him—
04032022 then when the land is subdued before the Lord, you may return and be free from your obligation to the Lord and to Israel. And this land will be your possession before the Lord.
04032023 “But if you fail to do this, you will be sinning against the Lord; and you may be sure that your sin will find you out.
04032024 Build cities for your women and children, and pens for your flocks, but do what you have promised.”
04032025 The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, “We your servants will do as our lord commands.
04032026 Our children and wives, our flocks and herds will remain here in the cities of Gilead.
04032027 But your servants, every man who is armed for battle, will cross over to fight before the Lord, just as our lord says.”
04032028 Then Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun and to the family heads of the Israelite tribes.
04032029 He said to them, “If the Gadites and Reubenites, every man armed for battle, cross over the Jordan with you before the Lord, then when the land is subdued before you, you must give them the land of Gilead as their possession.
04032030 But if they do not cross over with you armed, they must accept their possession with you in Canaan.”
04032031 The Gadites and Reubenites answered, “Your servants will do what the Lord has said.
04032032 We will cross over before the Lord into Canaan armed, but the property we inherit will be on this side of the Jordan.”
04032033 Then Moses gave to the Gadites, the Reubenites and the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan—the whole land with its cities and the territory around them.
04032034 The Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,
04032035 Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,
04032036 Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran as fortified cities, and built pens for their flocks.
04032037 And the Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh and Kiriathaim,
04032038 as well as Nebo and Baal Meon (these names were changed) and Sibmah. They gave names to the cities they rebuilt.
04032039 The descendants of Makir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it and drove out the Amorites who were there.
04032040 So Moses gave Gilead to the Makirites, the descendants of Manasseh, and they settled there.
04032041 Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, captured their settlements and called them Havvoth Jair.
04032042 And Nobah captured Kenath and its surrounding settlements and called it Nobah after himself.
04033001 Here are the stages in the journey of the Israelites when they came out of Egypt by divisions under the leadership of Moses and Aaron.
04033002 At the Lord’s command Moses recorded the stages in their journey. This is their journey by stages:
04033003 The Israelites set out from Rameses on the fifteenth day of the first month, the day after the Passover. They marched out defiantly in full view of all the Egyptians,
04033004 who were burying all their firstborn, whom the Lord had struck down among them; for the Lord had brought judgment on their gods.
04033005 The Israelites left Rameses and camped at Sukkoth.
04033006 They left Sukkoth and camped at Etham, on the edge of the desert.
04033007 They left Etham, turned back to Pi Hahiroth, to the east of Baal Zephon, and camped near Migdol.
04033008 They left Pi Hahiroth and passed through the sea into the desert, and when they had traveled for three days in the Desert of Etham, they camped at Marah.
04033009 They left Marah and went to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there.
04033010 They left Elim and camped by the Red Sea.
04033011 They left the Red Sea and camped in the Desert of Sin.
04033012 They left the Desert of Sin and camped at Dophkah.
04033013 They left Dophkah and camped at Alush.
04033014 They left Alush and camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink.
04033015 They left Rephidim and camped in the Desert of Sinai.
04033016 They left the Desert of Sinai and camped at Kibroth Hattaavah.
04033017 They left Kibroth Hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth.
04033018 They left Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah.
04033019 They left Rithmah and camped at Rimmon Perez.
04033020 They left Rimmon Perez and camped at Libnah.
04033021 They left Libnah and camped at Rissah.
04033022 They left Rissah and camped at Kehelathah.
04033023 They left Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher.
04033024 They left Mount Shepher and camped at Haradah.
04033025 They left Haradah and camped at Makheloth.
04033026 They left Makheloth and camped at Tahath.
04033027 They left Tahath and camped at Terah.
04033028 They left Terah and camped at Mithkah.
04033029 They left Mithkah and camped at Hashmonah.
04033030 They left Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth.
04033031 They left Moseroth and camped at Bene Jaakan.
04033032 They left Bene Jaakan and camped at Hor Haggidgad.
04033033 They left Hor Haggidgad and camped at Jotbathah.
04033034 They left Jotbathah and camped at Abronah.
04033035 They left Abronah and camped at Ezion Geber.
04033036 They left Ezion Geber and camped at Kadesh, in the Desert of Zin.
04033037 They left Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, on the border of Edom.
04033038 At the Lord’s command Aaron the priest went up Mount Hor, where he died on the first day of the fifth month of the fortieth year after the Israelites came out of Egypt.
04033039 Aaron was a hundred and twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor.
04033040 The Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev of Canaan, heard that the Israelites were coming.
04033041 They left Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.
04033042 They left Zalmonah and camped at Punon.
04033043 They left Punon and camped at Oboth.
04033044 They left Oboth and camped at Iye Abarim, on the border of Moab.
04033045 They left Iye Abarim and camped at Dibon Gad.
04033046 They left Dibon Gad and camped at Almon Diblathaim.
04033047 They left Almon Diblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim, near Nebo.
04033048 They left the mountains of Abarim and camped on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.
04033049 There on the plains of Moab they camped along the Jordan from Beth Jeshimoth to Abel Shittim.
04033050 On the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho the Lord said to Moses,
04033051 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When you cross the Jordan into Canaan,
04033052 drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you. Destroy all their carved images and their cast idols, and demolish all their high places.
04033053 Take possession of the land and settle in it, for I have given you the land to possess.
04033054 Distribute the land by lot, according to your clans. To a larger group give a larger inheritance, and to a smaller group a smaller one. Whatever falls to them by lot will be theirs. Distribute it according to your ancestral tribes.
04033055 “ ‘But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land, those you allow to remain will become barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides. They will give you trouble in the land where you will live.
04033056 And then I will do to you what I plan to do to them.’ ”
04034001 The Lord said to Moses,
04034002 “Command the Israelites and say to them: ‘When you enter Canaan, the land that will be allotted to you as an inheritance is to have these boundaries:
04034003 “ ‘Your southern side will include some of the Desert of Zin along the border of Edom. Your southern boundary will start in the east from the southern end of the Dead Sea,
04034004 cross south of Scorpion Pass, continue on to Zin and go south of Kadesh Barnea. Then it will go to Hazar Addar and over to Azmon,
04034005 where it will turn, join the Wadi of Egypt and end at the Mediterranean Sea.
04034006 “ ‘Your western boundary will be the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. This will be your boundary on the west.
04034007 “ ‘For your northern boundary, run a line from the Mediterranean Sea to Mount Hor
04034008 and from Mount Hor to Lebo Hamath. Then the boundary will go to Zedad,
04034009 continue to Ziphron and end at Hazar Enan. This will be your boundary on the north.
04034010 “ ‘For your eastern boundary, run a line from Hazar Enan to Shepham.
04034011 The boundary will go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain and continue along the slopes east of the Sea of Galilee.
04034012 Then the boundary will go down along the Jordan and end at the Dead Sea. “ ‘This will be your land, with its boundaries on every side.’ ”
04034013 Moses commanded the Israelites: “Assign this land by lot as an inheritance. The Lord has ordered that it be given to the nine-and-a-half tribes,
04034014 because the families of the tribe of Reuben, the tribe of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance.
04034015 These two-and-a-half tribes have received their inheritance east of the Jordan across from Jericho, toward the sunrise.”
04034016 The Lord said to Moses,
04034017 “These are the names of the men who are to assign the land for you as an inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun.
04034018 And appoint one leader from each tribe to help assign the land.
04034019 These are their names: Caleb son of Jephunneh, from the tribe of Judah;
04034020 Shemuel son of Ammihud, from the tribe of Simeon;
04034021 Elidad son of Kislon, from the tribe of Benjamin;
04034022 Bukki son of Jogli, the leader from the tribe of Dan;
04034023 Hanniel son of Ephod, the leader from the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph;
04034024 Kemuel son of Shiphtan, the leader from the tribe of Ephraim son of Joseph;
04034025 Elizaphan son of Parnak, the leader from the tribe of Zebulun;
04034026 Paltiel son of Azzan, the leader from the tribe of Issachar;
04034027 Ahihud son of Shelomi, the leader from the tribe of Asher;
04034028 Pedahel son of Ammihud, the leader from the tribe of Naphtali.”
04034029 These are the men the Lord commanded to assign the inheritance to the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
04035001 On the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, the Lord said to Moses,
04035002 “Command the Israelites to give the Levites towns to live in from the inheritance the Israelites will possess. And give them pasturelands around the towns.
04035003 Then they will have towns to live in and pasturelands for the cattle they own and all their other animals.
04035004 “The pasturelands around the towns that you give the Levites will extend a thousand cubits from the town wall.
04035005 Outside the town, measure two thousand cubits on the east side, two thousand on the south side, two thousand on the west and two thousand on the north, with the town in the center. They will have this area as pastureland for the towns.
04035006 “Six of the towns you give the Levites will be cities of refuge, to which a person who has killed someone may flee. In addition, give them forty-two other towns.
04035007 In all you must give the Levites forty-eight towns, together with their pasturelands.
04035008 The towns you give the Levites from the land the Israelites possess are to be given in proportion to the inheritance of each tribe: Take many towns from a tribe that has many, but few from one that has few.”
04035009 Then the Lord said to Moses:
04035010 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When you cross the Jordan into Canaan,
04035011 select some towns to be your cities of refuge, to which a person who has killed someone accidentally may flee.
04035012 They will be places of refuge from the avenger, so that anyone accused of murder may not die before they stand trial before the assembly.
04035013 These six towns you give will be your cities of refuge.
04035014 Give three on this side of the Jordan and three in Canaan as cities of refuge.
04035015 These six towns will be a place of refuge for Israelites and for foreigners residing among them, so that anyone who has killed another accidentally can flee there.
04035016 “ ‘If anyone strikes someone a fatal blow with an iron object, that person is a murderer; the murderer is to be put to death.
04035017 Or if anyone is holding a stone and strikes someone a fatal blow with it, that person is a murderer; the murderer is to be put to death.
04035018 Or if anyone is holding a wooden object and strikes someone a fatal blow with it, that person is a murderer; the murderer is to be put to death.
04035019 The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death; when the avenger comes upon the murderer, the avenger shall put the murderer to death.
04035020 If anyone with malice aforethought shoves another or throws something at them intentionally so that they die
04035021 or if out of enmity one person hits another with their fist so that the other dies, that person is to be put to death; that person is a murderer. The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when they meet.
04035022 “ ‘But if without enmity someone suddenly pushes another or throws something at them unintentionally
04035023 or, without seeing them, drops on them a stone heavy enough to kill them, and they die, then since that other person was not an enemy and no harm was intended,
04035024 the assembly must judge between the accused and the avenger of blood according to these regulations.
04035025 The assembly must protect the one accused of murder from the avenger of blood and send the accused back to the city of refuge to which they fled. The accused must stay there until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.
04035026 “ ‘But if the accused ever goes outside the limits of the city of refuge to which they fled
04035027 and the avenger of blood finds them outside the city, the avenger of blood may kill the accused without being guilty of murder.
04035028 The accused must stay in the city of refuge until the death of the high priest; only after the death of the high priest may they return to their own property.
04035029 “ ‘This is to have the force of law for you throughout the generations to come, wherever you live.
04035030 “ ‘Anyone who kills a person is to be put to death as a murderer only on the testimony of witnesses. But no one is to be put to death on the testimony of only one witness.
04035031 “ ‘Do not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer, who deserves to die. They are to be put to death.
04035032 “ ‘Do not accept a ransom for anyone who has fled to a city of refuge and so allow them to go back and live on their own land before the death of the high priest.
04035033 “ ‘Do not pollute the land where you are. Bloodshed pollutes the land, and atonement cannot be made for the land on which blood has been shed, except by the blood of the one who shed it.
04035034 Do not defile the land where you live and where I dwell, for I, the Lord, dwell among the Israelites.’ ”
04036001 The family heads of the clan of Gilead son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, who were from the clans of the descendants of Joseph, came and spoke before Moses and the leaders, the heads of the Israelite families.
04036002 They said, “When the Lord commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance to the Israelites by lot, he ordered you to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.
04036003 Now suppose they marry men from other Israelite tribes; then their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral inheritance and added to that of the tribe they marry into. And so part of the inheritance allotted to us will be taken away.
04036004 When the Year of Jubilee for the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe into which they marry, and their property will be taken from the tribal inheritance of our ancestors.”
04036005 Then at the Lord’s command Moses gave this order to the Israelites: “What the tribe of the descendants of Joseph is saying is right.
04036006 This is what the Lord commands for Zelophehad’s daughters: They may marry anyone they please as long as they marry within their father’s tribal clan.
04036007 No inheritance in Israel is to pass from one tribe to another, for every Israelite shall keep the tribal inheritance of their ancestors.
04036008 Every daughter who inherits land in any Israelite tribe must marry someone in her father’s tribal clan, so that every Israelite will possess the inheritance of their ancestors.
04036009 No inheritance may pass from one tribe to another, for each Israelite tribe is to keep the land it inherits.”
04036010 So Zelophehad’s daughters did as the Lord commanded Moses.
04036011 Zelophehad’s daughters—Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milkah and Noah—married their cousins on their father’s side.
04036012 They married within the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in their father’s tribe and clan.
04036013 These are the commands and regulations the Lord gave through Moses to the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.
05001001 These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel in the wilderness east of the Jordan—that is, in the Arabah—opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Dizahab.
05001002 (It takes eleven days to go from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the Mount Seir road.)
05001003 In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that the Lord had commanded him concerning them.
05001004 This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.
05001005 East of the Jordan in the territory of Moab, Moses began to expound this law, saying:
05001006 The Lord our God said to us at Horeb, “You have stayed long enough at this mountain.
05001007 Break camp and advance into the hill country of the Amorites; go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the mountains, in the western foothills, in the Negev and along the coast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the Euphrates.
05001008 See, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land the Lord swore he would give to your fathers—to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—and to their descendants after them.”
05001009 At that time I said to you, “You are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone.
05001010 The Lord your God has increased your numbers so that today you are as numerous as the stars in the sky.
05001011 May the Lord, the God of your ancestors, increase you a thousand times and bless you as he has promised!
05001012 But how can I bear your problems and your burdens and your disputes all by myself?
05001013 Choose some wise, understanding and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will set them over you.”
05001014 You answered me, “What you propose to do is good.”
05001015 So I took the leading men of your tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them to have authority over you—as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens and as tribal officials.
05001016 And I charged your judges at that time, “Hear the disputes between your people and judge fairly, whether the case is between two Israelites or between an Israelite and a foreigner residing among you.
05001017 Do not show partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be afraid of anyone, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too hard for you, and I will hear it.”
05001018 And at that time I told you everything you were to do.
05001019 Then, as the Lord our God commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the Amorites through all that vast and dreadful wilderness that you have seen, and so we reached Kadesh Barnea.
05001020 Then I said to you, “You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the Lord our God is giving us.
05001021 See, the Lord your God has given you the land. Go up and take possession of it as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, told you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.”
05001022 Then all of you came to me and said, “Let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to.”
05001023 The idea seemed good to me; so I selected twelve of you, one man from each tribe.
05001024 They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshkol and explored it.
05001025 Taking with them some of the fruit of the land, they brought it down to us and reported, “It is a good land that the Lord our God is giving us.”
05001026 But you were unwilling to go up; you rebelled against the command of the Lord your God.
05001027 You grumbled in your tents and said, “The Lord hates us; so he brought us out of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us.
05001028 Where can we go? Our brothers have made our hearts melt in fear. They say, ‘The people are stronger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls up to the sky. We even saw the Anakites there.’ ”
05001029 Then I said to you, “Do not be terrified; do not be afraid of them.
05001030 The Lord your God, who is going before you, will fight for you, as he did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes,
05001031 and in the wilderness. There you saw how the Lord your God carried you, as a father carries his son, all the way you went until you reached this place.”
05001032 In spite of this, you did not trust in the Lord your God,
05001033 who went ahead of you on your journey, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go.
05001034 When the Lord heard what you said, he was angry and solemnly swore:
05001035 “No one from this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your ancestors,
05001036 except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on, because he followed the Lord wholeheartedly.”
05001037 Because of you the Lord became angry with me also and said, “You shall not enter it, either.
05001038 But your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will enter it. Encourage him, because he will lead Israel to inherit it.
05001039 And the little ones that you said would be taken captive, your children who do not yet know good from bad—they will enter the land. I will give it to them and they will take possession of it.
05001040 But as for you, turn around and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea. ”
05001041 Then you replied, “We have sinned against the Lord. We will go up and fight, as the Lord our God commanded us.” So every one of you put on his weapons, thinking it easy to go up into the hill country.
05001042 But the Lord said to me, “Tell them, ‘Do not go up and fight, because I will not be with you. You will be defeated by your enemies.’ ”
05001043 So I told you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the Lord’s command and in your arrogance you marched up into the hill country.
05001044 The Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you; they chased you like a swarm of bees and beat you down from Seir all the way to Hormah.
05001045 You came back and wept before the Lord, but he paid no attention to your weeping and turned a deaf ear to you.
05001046 And so you stayed in Kadesh many days—all the time you spent there.
05002001 Then we turned back and set out toward the wilderness along the route to the Red Sea, as the Lord had directed me. For a long time we made our way around the hill country of Seir.
05002002 Then the Lord said to me,
05002003 “You have made your way around this hill country long enough; now turn north.
05002004 Give the people these orders: ‘You are about to pass through the territory of your relatives the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, but be very careful.
05002005 Do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, not even enough to put your foot on. I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his own.
05002006 You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.’ ”
05002007 The Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this vast wilderness. These forty years the Lord your God has been with you, and you have not lacked anything.
05002008 So we went on past our relatives the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber, and traveled along the desert road of Moab.
05002009 Then the Lord said to me, “Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession.”
05002010 (The Emites used to live there—a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites.
05002011 Like the Anakites, they too were considered Rephaites, but the Moabites called them Emites.
05002012 Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out. They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did in the land the Lord gave them as their possession.)
05002013 And the Lord said, “Now get up and cross the Zered Valley.” So we crossed the valley.
05002014 Thirty-eight years passed from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley. By then, that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the Lord had sworn to them.
05002015 The Lord’s hand was against them until he had completely eliminated them from the camp.
05002016 Now when the last of these fighting men among the people had died,
05002017 the Lord said to me,
05002018 “Today you are to pass by the region of Moab at Ar.
05002019 When you come to the Ammonites, do not harass them or provoke them to war, for I will not give you possession of any land belonging to the Ammonites. I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot.”
05002020 (That too was considered a land of the Rephaites, who used to live there; but the Ammonites called them Zamzummites.
05002021 They were a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites. The Lord destroyed them from before the Ammonites, who drove them out and settled in their place.
05002022 The Lord had done the same for the descendants of Esau, who lived in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them. They drove them out and have lived in their place to this day.
05002023 And as for the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorites coming out from Caphtor destroyed them and settled in their place.)
05002024 “Set out now and cross the Arnon Gorge. See, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his country. Begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle.
05002025 This very day I will begin to put the terror and fear of you on all the nations under heaven. They will hear reports of you and will tremble and be in anguish because of you.”
05002026 From the Desert of Kedemoth I sent messengers to Sihon king of Heshbon offering peace and saying,
05002027 “Let us pass through your country. We will stay on the main road; we will not turn aside to the right or to the left.
05002028 Sell us food to eat and water to drink for their price in silver. Only let us pass through on foot—
05002029 as the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, did for us—until we cross the Jordan into the land the Lord our God is giving us.”
05002030 But Sihon king of Heshbon refused to let us pass through. For the Lord your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to give him into your hands, as he has now done.
05002031 The Lord said to me, “See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his country over to you. Now begin to conquer and possess his land.”
05002032 When Sihon and all his army came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz,
05002033 the Lord our God delivered him over to us and we struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army.
05002034 At that time we took all his towns and completely destroyed them—men, women and children. We left no survivors.
05002035 But the livestock and the plunder from the towns we had captured we carried off for ourselves.
05002036 From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the gorge, even as far as Gilead, not one town was too strong for us. The Lord our God gave us all of them.
05002037 But in accordance with the command of the Lord our God, you did not encroach on any of the land of the Ammonites, neither the land along the course of the Jabbok nor that around the towns in the hills.
05003001 Next we turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan with his whole army marched out to meet us in battle at Edrei.
05003002 The Lord said to me, “Do not be afraid of him, for I have delivered him into your hands, along with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon.”
05003003 So the Lord our God also gave into our hands Og king of Bashan and all his army. We struck them down, leaving no survivors.
05003004 At that time we took all his cities. There was not one of the sixty cities that we did not take from them—the whole region of Argob, Og’s kingdom in Bashan.
05003005 All these cities were fortified with high walls and with gates and bars, and there were also a great many unwalled villages.
05003006 We completely destroyed them, as we had done with Sihon king of Heshbon, destroying every city—men, women and children.
05003007 But all the livestock and the plunder from their cities we carried off for ourselves.
05003008 So at that time we took from these two kings of the Amorites the territory east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge as far as Mount Hermon.
05003009 (Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians; the Amorites call it Senir.)
05003010 We took all the towns on the plateau, and all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as Salekah and Edrei, towns of Og’s kingdom in Bashan.
05003011 (Og king of Bashan was the last of the Rephaites. His bed was decorated with iron and was more than nine cubits long and four cubits wide. It is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.)
05003012 Of the land that we took over at that time, I gave the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory north of Aroer by the Arnon Gorge, including half the hill country of Gilead, together with its towns.
05003013 The rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of Argob in Bashan used to be known as a land of the Rephaites.
05003014 Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maakathites; it was named after him, so that to this day Bashan is called Havvoth Jair. )
05003015 And I gave Gilead to Makir.
05003016 But to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory extending from Gilead down to the Arnon Gorge (the middle of the gorge being the border) and out to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites.
05003017 Its western border was the Jordan in the Arabah, from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah.
05003018 I commanded you at that time: “The Lord your God has given you this land to take possession of it. But all your able-bodied men, armed for battle, must cross over ahead of the other Israelites.
05003019 However, your wives, your children and your livestock (I know you have much livestock) may stay in the towns I have given you,
05003020 until the Lord gives rest to your fellow Israelites as he has to you, and they too have taken over the land that the Lord your God is giving them across the Jordan. After that, each of you may go back to the possession I have given you.”
05003021 At that time I commanded Joshua: “You have seen with your own eyes all that the Lord your God has done to these two kings. The Lord will do the same to all the kingdoms over there where you are going.
05003022 Do not be afraid of them; the Lord your God himself will fight for you.”
05003023 At that time I pleaded with the Lord:
05003024 “Sovereign Lord, you have begun to show to your servant your greatness and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do the deeds and mighty works you do?
05003025 Let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan—that fine hill country and Lebanon.”
05003026 But because of you the Lord was angry with me and would not listen to me. “That is enough,” the Lord said. “Do not speak to me anymore about this matter.
05003027 Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west and north and south and east. Look at the land with your own eyes, since you are not going to cross this Jordan.
05003028 But commission Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead this people across and will cause them to inherit the land that you will see.”
05003029 So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.
05004001 Now, Israel, hear the decrees and laws I am about to teach you. Follow them so that you may live and may go in and take possession of the land the Lord, the God of your ancestors, is giving you.
05004002 Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it, but keep the commands of the Lord your God that I give you.
05004003 You saw with your own eyes what the Lord did at Baal Peor. The Lord your God destroyed from among you everyone who followed the Baal of Peor,
05004004 but all of you who held fast to the Lord your God are still alive today.
05004005 See, I have taught you decrees and laws as the Lord my God commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to take possession of it.
05004006 Observe them carefully, for this will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations, who will hear about all these decrees and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.”
05004007 What other nation is so great as to have their gods near them the way the Lord our God is near us whenever we pray to him?
05004008 And what other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and laws as this body of laws I am setting before you today?
05004009 Only be careful, and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them fade from your heart as long as you live. Teach them to your children and to their children after them.
05004010 Remember the day you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb, when he said to me, “Assemble the people before me to hear my words so that they may learn to revere me as long as they live in the land and may teach them to their children.”
05004011 You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it blazed with fire to the very heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness.
05004012 Then the Lord spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice.
05004013 He declared to you his covenant, the Ten Commandments, which he commanded you to follow and then wrote them on two stone tablets.
05004014 And the Lord directed me at that time to teach you the decrees and laws you are to follow in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.
05004015 You saw no form of any kind the day the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire. Therefore watch yourselves very carefully,
05004016 so that you do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol, an image of any shape, whether formed like a man or a woman,
05004017 or like any animal on earth or any bird that flies in the air,
05004018 or like any creature that moves along the ground or any fish in the waters below.
05004019 And when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon and the stars—all the heavenly array—do not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshiping things the Lord your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven.
05004020 But as for you, the Lord took you and brought you out of the iron-smelting furnace, out of Egypt, to be the people of his inheritance, as you now are.
05004021 The Lord was angry with me because of you, and he solemnly swore that I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the Lord your God is giving you as your inheritance.
05004022 I will die in this land; I will not cross the Jordan; but you are about to cross over and take possession of that good land.
05004023 Be careful not to forget the covenant of the Lord your God that he made with you; do not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything the Lord your God has forbidden.
05004024 For the Lord your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.
05004025 After you have had children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time—if you then become corrupt and make any kind of idol, doing evil in the eyes of the Lord your God and arousing his anger,
05004026 I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You will not live there long but will certainly be destroyed.
05004027 The Lord will scatter you among the peoples, and only a few of you will survive among the nations to which the Lord will drive you.
05004028 There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell.
05004029 But if from there you seek the Lord your God, you will find him if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul.
05004030 When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, then in later days you will return to the Lord your God and obey him.
05004031 For the Lord your God is a merciful God; he will not abandon or destroy you or forget the covenant with your ancestors, which he confirmed to them by oath.
05004032 Ask now about the former days, long before your time, from the day God created human beings on the earth; ask from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything so great as this ever happened, or has anything like it ever been heard of?
05004033 Has any other people heard the voice of God speaking out of fire, as you have, and lived?
05004034 Has any god ever tried to take for himself one nation out of another nation, by testings, by signs and wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, or by great and awesome deeds, like all the things the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?
05004035 You were shown these things so that you might know that the Lord is God; besides him there is no other.
05004036 From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you. On earth he showed you his great fire, and you heard his words from out of the fire.
05004037 Because he loved your ancestors and chose their descendants after them, he brought you out of Egypt by his Presence and his great strength,
05004038 to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you into their land to give it to you for your inheritance, as it is today.
05004039 Acknowledge and take to heart this day that the Lord is God in heaven above and on the earth below. There is no other.
05004040 Keep his decrees and commands, which I am giving you today, so that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may live long in the land the Lord your God gives you for all time.
05004041 Then Moses set aside three cities east of the Jordan,
05004042 to which anyone who had killed a person could flee if they had unintentionally killed a neighbor without malice aforethought. They could flee into one of these cities and save their life.
05004043 The cities were these: Bezer in the wilderness plateau, for the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.
05004044 This is the law Moses set before the Israelites.
05004045 These are the stipulations, decrees and laws Moses gave them when they came out of Egypt
05004046 and were in the valley near Beth Peor east of the Jordan, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon and was defeated by Moses and the Israelites as they came out of Egypt.
05004047 They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan.
05004048 This land extended from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge to Mount Sirion (that is, Hermon),
05004049 and included all the Arabah east of the Jordan, as far as the Dead Sea, below the slopes of Pisgah.
05005001 Moses summoned all Israel and said: Hear, Israel, the decrees and laws I declare in your hearing today. Learn them and be sure to follow them.
05005002 The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.
05005003 It was not with our ancestors that the Lord made this covenant, but with us, with all of us who are alive here today.
05005004 The Lord spoke to you face to face out of the fire on the mountain.
05005005 (At that time I stood between the Lord and you to declare to you the word of the Lord, because you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain.) And he said:
05005006 “I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
05005007 “You shall have no other gods before me.
05005008 “You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.
05005009 You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,
05005010 but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.
05005011 “You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.
05005012 “Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the Lord your God has commanded you.
05005013 Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
05005014 but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your ox, your donkey or any of your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns, so that your male and female servants may rest, as you do.
05005015 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the Lord your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.
05005016 “Honor your father and your mother, as the Lord your God has commanded you, so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in the land the Lord your God is giving you.
05005017 “You shall not murder.
05005018 “You shall not commit adultery.
05005019 “You shall not steal.
05005020 “You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
05005021 “You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife. You shall not set your desire on your neighbor’s house or land, his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”
05005022 These are the commandments the Lord proclaimed in a loud voice to your whole assembly there on the mountain from out of the fire, the cloud and the deep darkness; and he added nothing more. Then he wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me.
05005023 When you heard the voice out of the darkness, while the mountain was ablaze with fire, all the leaders of your tribes and your elders came to me.
05005024 And you said, “The Lord our God has shown us his glory and his majesty, and we have heard his voice from the fire. Today we have seen that a person can live even if God speaks with them.
05005025 But now, why should we die? This great fire will consume us, and we will die if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any longer.
05005026 For what mortal has ever heard the voice of the living God speaking out of fire, as we have, and survived?
05005027 Go near and listen to all that the Lord our God says. Then tell us whatever the Lord our God tells you. We will listen and obey.”
05005028 The Lord heard you when you spoke to me, and the Lord said to me, “I have heard what this people said to you. Everything they said was good.
05005029 Oh, that their hearts would be inclined to fear me and keep all my commands always, so that it might go well with them and their children forever!
05005030 “Go, tell them to return to their tents.
05005031 But you stay here with me so that I may give you all the commands, decrees and laws you are to teach them to follow in the land I am giving them to possess.”
05005032 So be careful to do what the Lord your God has commanded you; do not turn aside to the right or to the left.
05005033 Walk in obedience to all that the Lord your God has commanded you, so that you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land that you will possess.
05006001 These are the commands, decrees and laws the Lord your God directed me to teach you to observe in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess,
05006002 so that you, your children and their children after them may fear the Lord your God as long as you live by keeping all his decrees and commands that I give you, and so that you may enjoy long life.
05006003 Hear, Israel, and be careful to obey so that it may go well with you and that you may increase greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, promised you.
05006004 Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.
05006005 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.
05006006 These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts.
05006007 Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.
05006008 Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.
05006009 Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.
05006010 When the Lord your God brings you into the land he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give you—a land with large, flourishing cities you did not build,
05006011 houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant—then when you eat and are satisfied,
05006012 be careful that you do not forget the Lord, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
05006013 Fear the Lord your God, serve him only and take your oaths in his name.
05006014 Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you;
05006015 for the Lord your God, who is among you, is a jealous God and his anger will burn against you, and he will destroy you from the face of the land.
05006016 Do not put the Lord your God to the test as you did at Massah.
05006017 Be sure to keep the commands of the Lord your God and the stipulations and decrees he has given you.
05006018 Do what is right and good in the Lord’s sight, so that it may go well with you and you may go in and take over the good land the Lord promised on oath to your ancestors,
05006019 thrusting out all your enemies before you, as the Lord said.
05006020 In the future, when your son asks you, “What is the meaning of the stipulations, decrees and laws the Lord our God has commanded you?”
05006021 tell him: “We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, but the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
05006022 Before our eyes the Lord sent signs and wonders—great and terrible—on Egypt and Pharaoh and his whole household.
05006023 But he brought us out from there to bring us in and give us the land he promised on oath to our ancestors.
05006024 The Lord commanded us to obey all these decrees and to fear the Lord our God, so that we might always prosper and be kept alive, as is the case today.
05006025 And if we are careful to obey all this law before the Lord our God, as he has commanded us, that will be our righteousness.”
05007001 When the Lord your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out before you many nations—the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, seven nations larger and stronger than you—
05007002 and when the Lord your God has delivered them over to you and you have defeated them, then you must destroy them totally. Make no treaty with them, and show them no mercy.
05007003 Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons,
05007004 for they will turn your children away from following me to serve other gods, and the Lord’s anger will burn against you and will quickly destroy you.
05007005 This is what you are to do to them: Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones, cut down their Asherah poles and burn their idols in the fire.
05007006 For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people, his treasured possession.
05007007 The Lord did not set his affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples.
05007008 But it was because the Lord loved you and kept the oath he swore to your ancestors that he brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
05007009 Know therefore that the Lord your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commandments.
05007010 But those who hate him he will repay to their face by destruction; he will not be slow to repay to their face those who hate him.
05007011 Therefore, take care to follow the commands, decrees and laws I give you today.
05007012 If you pay attention to these laws and are careful to follow them, then the Lord your God will keep his covenant of love with you, as he swore to your ancestors.
05007013 He will love you and bless you and increase your numbers. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land—your grain, new wine and olive oil—the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land he swore to your ancestors to give you.
05007014 You will be blessed more than any other people; none of your men or women will be childless, nor will any of your livestock be without young.
05007015 The Lord will keep you free from every disease. He will not inflict on you the horrible diseases you knew in Egypt, but he will inflict them on all who hate you.
05007016 You must destroy all the peoples the Lord your God gives over to you. Do not look on them with pity and do not serve their gods, for that will be a snare to you.
05007017 You may say to yourselves, “These nations are stronger than we are. How can we drive them out?”
05007018 But do not be afraid of them; remember well what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt.
05007019 You saw with your own eyes the great trials, the signs and wonders, the mighty hand and outstretched arm, with which the Lord your God brought you out. The Lord your God will do the same to all the peoples you now fear.
05007020 Moreover, the Lord your God will send the hornet among them until even the survivors who hide from you have perished.
05007021 Do not be terrified by them, for the Lord your God, who is among you, is a great and awesome God.
05007022 The Lord your God will drive out those nations before you, little by little. You will not be allowed to eliminate them all at once, or the wild animals will multiply around you.
05007023 But the Lord your God will deliver them over to you, throwing them into great confusion until they are destroyed.
05007024 He will give their kings into your hand, and you will wipe out their names from under heaven. No one will be able to stand up against you; you will destroy them.
05007025 The images of their gods you are to burn in the fire. Do not covet the silver and gold on them, and do not take it for yourselves, or you will be ensnared by it, for it is detestable to the Lord your God.
05007026 Do not bring a detestable thing into your house or you, like it, will be set apart for destruction. Regard it as vile and utterly detest it, for it is set apart for destruction.
05008001 Be careful to follow every command I am giving you today, so that you may live and increase and may enter and possess the land the Lord promised on oath to your ancestors.
05008002 Remember how the Lord your God led you all the way in the wilderness these forty years, to humble and test you in order to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep his commands.
05008003 He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your ancestors had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.
05008004 Your clothes did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years.
05008005 Know then in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so the Lord your God disciplines you.
05008006 Observe the commands of the Lord your God, walking in obedience to him and revering him.
05008007 For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land—a land with brooks, streams, and deep springs gushing out into the valleys and hills;
05008008 a land with wheat and barley, vines and fig trees, pomegranates, olive oil and honey;
05008009 a land where bread will not be scarce and you will lack nothing; a land where the rocks are iron and you can dig copper out of the hills.
05008010 When you have eaten and are satisfied, praise the Lord your God for the good land he has given you.
05008011 Be careful that you do not forget the Lord your God, failing to observe his commands, his laws and his decrees that I am giving you this day.
05008012 Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses and settle down,
05008013 and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all you have is multiplied,
05008014 then your heart will become proud and you will forget the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
05008015 He led you through the vast and dreadful wilderness, that thirsty and waterless land, with its venomous snakes and scorpions. He brought you water out of hard rock.
05008016 He gave you manna to eat in the wilderness, something your ancestors had never known, to humble and test you so that in the end it might go well with you.
05008017 You may say to yourself, “My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me.”
05008018 But remember the Lord your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth, and so confirms his covenant, which he swore to your ancestors, as it is today.
05008019 If you ever forget the Lord your God and follow other gods and worship and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will surely be destroyed.
05008020 Like the nations the Lord destroyed before you, so you will be destroyed for not obeying the Lord your God.
05009001 Hear, Israel: You are now about to cross the Jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and stronger than you, with large cities that have walls up to the sky.
05009002 The people are strong and tall—Anakites! You know about them and have heard it said: “Who can stand up against the Anakites?”
05009003 But be assured today that the Lord your God is the one who goes across ahead of you like a devouring fire. He will destroy them; he will subdue them before you. And you will drive them out and annihilate them quickly, as the Lord has promised you.
05009004 After the Lord your God has driven them out before you, do not say to yourself, “The Lord has brought me here to take possession of this land because of my righteousness.” No, it is on account of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord is going to drive them out before you.
05009005 It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going in to take possession of their land; but on account of the wickedness of these nations, the Lord your God will drive them out before you, to accomplish what he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
05009006 Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the Lord your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked people.
05009007 Remember this and never forget how you aroused the anger of the Lord your God in the wilderness. From the day you left Egypt until you arrived here, you have been rebellious against the Lord.
05009008 At Horeb you aroused the Lord’s wrath so that he was angry enough to destroy you.
05009009 When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the Lord had made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water.
05009010 The Lord gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God. On them were all the commandments the Lord proclaimed to you on the mountain out of the fire, on the day of the assembly.
05009011 At the end of the forty days and forty nights, the Lord gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.
05009012 Then the Lord told me, “Go down from here at once, because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt. They have turned away quickly from what I commanded them and have made an idol for themselves.”
05009013 And the Lord said to me, “I have seen this people, and they are a stiff-necked people indeed!
05009014 Let me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they.”
05009015 So I turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands.
05009016 When I looked, I saw that you had sinned against the Lord your God; you had made for yourselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the Lord had commanded you.
05009017 So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, breaking them to pieces before your eyes.
05009018 Then once again I fell prostrate before the Lord for forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water, because of all the sin you had committed, doing what was evil in the Lord’s sight and so arousing his anger.
05009019 I feared the anger and wrath of the Lord, for he was angry enough with you to destroy you. But again the Lord listened to me.
05009020 And the Lord was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but at that time I prayed for Aaron too.
05009021 Also I took that sinful thing of yours, the calf you had made, and burned it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain.
05009022 You also made the Lord angry at Taberah, at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah.
05009023 And when the Lord sent you out from Kadesh Barnea, he said, “Go up and take possession of the land I have given you.” But you rebelled against the command of the Lord your God. You did not trust him or obey him.
05009024 You have been rebellious against the Lord ever since I have known you.
05009025 I lay prostrate before the Lord those forty days and forty nights because the Lord had said he would destroy you.
05009026 I prayed to the Lord and said, “Sovereign Lord, do not destroy your people, your own inheritance that you redeemed by your great power and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
05009027 Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Overlook the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their sin.
05009028 Otherwise, the country from which you brought us will say, ‘Because the Lord was not able to take them into the land he had promised them, and because he hated them, he brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness.’
05009029 But they are your people, your inheritance that you brought out by your great power and your outstretched arm.”
05010001 At that time the Lord said to me, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones and come up to me on the mountain. Also make a wooden ark.
05010002 I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Then you are to put them in the ark.”
05010003 So I made the ark out of acacia wood and chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hands.
05010004 The Lord wrote on these tablets what he had written before, the Ten Commandments he had proclaimed to you on the mountain, out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. And the Lord gave them to me.
05010005 Then I came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made, as the Lord commanded me, and they are there now.
05010006 (The Israelites traveled from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest.
05010007 From there they traveled to Gudgodah and on to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water.
05010008 At that time the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister and to pronounce blessings in his name, as they still do today.
05010009 That is why the Levites have no share or inheritance among their fellow Israelites; the Lord is their inheritance, as the Lord your God told them.)
05010010 Now I had stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, as I did the first time, and the Lord listened to me at this time also. It was not his will to destroy you.
05010011 “Go,” the Lord said to me, “and lead the people on their way, so that they may enter and possess the land I swore to their ancestors to give them.”
05010012 And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you but to fear the Lord your God, to walk in obedience to him, to love him, to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul,
05010013 and to observe the Lord’s commands and decrees that I am giving you today for your own good?
05010014 To the Lord your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, the earth and everything in it.
05010015 Yet the Lord set his affection on your ancestors and loved them, and he chose you, their descendants, above all the nations—as it is today.
05010016 Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and do not be stiff-necked any longer.
05010017 For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes.
05010018 He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the foreigner residing among you, giving them food and clothing.
05010019 And you are to love those who are foreigners, for you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt.
05010020 Fear the Lord your God and serve him. Hold fast to him and take your oaths in his name.
05010021 He is the one you praise; he is your God, who performed for you those great and awesome wonders you saw with your own eyes.
05010022 Your ancestors who went down into Egypt were seventy in all, and now the Lord your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky.
05011001 Love the Lord your God and keep his requirements, his decrees, his laws and his commands always.
05011002 Remember today that your children were not the ones who saw and experienced the discipline of the Lord your God: his majesty, his mighty hand, his outstretched arm;
05011003 the signs he performed and the things he did in the heart of Egypt, both to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his whole country;
05011004 what he did to the Egyptian army, to its horses and chariots, how he overwhelmed them with the waters of the Red Sea as they were pursuing you, and how the Lord brought lasting ruin on them.
05011005 It was not your children who saw what he did for you in the wilderness until you arrived at this place,
05011006 and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when the earth opened its mouth right in the middle of all Israel and swallowed them up with their households, their tents and every living thing that belonged to them.
05011007 But it was your own eyes that saw all these great things the Lord has done.
05011008 Observe therefore all the commands I am giving you today, so that you may have the strength to go in and take over the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess,
05011009 and so that you may live long in the land the Lord swore to your ancestors to give to them and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey.
05011010 The land you are entering to take over is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you planted your seed and irrigated it by foot as in a vegetable garden.
05011011 But the land you are crossing the Jordan to take possession of is a land of mountains and valleys that drinks rain from heaven.
05011012 It is a land the Lord your God cares for; the eyes of the Lord your God are continually on it from the beginning of the year to its end.
05011013 So if you faithfully obey the commands I am giving you today—to love the Lord your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul—
05011014 then I will send rain on your land in its season, both autumn and spring rains, so that you may gather in your grain, new wine and olive oil.
05011015 I will provide grass in the fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied.
05011016 Be careful, or you will be enticed to turn away and worship other gods and bow down to them.
05011017 Then the Lord’s anger will burn against you, and he will shut up the heavens so that it will not rain and the ground will yield no produce, and you will soon perish from the good land the Lord is giving you.
05011018 Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds; tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.
05011019 Teach them to your children, talking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.
05011020 Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates,
05011021 so that your days and the days of your children may be many in the land the Lord swore to give your ancestors, as many as the days that the heavens are above the earth.
05011022 If you carefully observe all these commands I am giving you to follow—to love the Lord your God, to walk in obedience to him and to hold fast to him—
05011023 then the Lord will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations larger and stronger than you.
05011024 Every place where you set your foot will be yours: Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean Sea.
05011025 No one will be able to stand against you. The Lord your God, as he promised you, will put the terror and fear of you on the whole land, wherever you go.
05011026 See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse—
05011027 the blessing if you obey the commands of the Lord your God that I am giving you today;
05011028 the curse if you disobey the commands of the Lord your God and turn from the way that I command you today by following other gods, which you have not known.
05011029 When the Lord your God has brought you into the land you are entering to possess, you are to proclaim on Mount Gerizim the blessings, and on Mount Ebal the curses.
05011030 As you know, these mountains are across the Jordan, westward, toward the setting sun, near the great trees of Moreh, in the territory of those Canaanites living in the Arabah in the vicinity of Gilgal.
05011031 You are about to cross the Jordan to enter and take possession of the land the Lord your God is giving you. When you have taken it over and are living there,
05011032 be sure that you obey all the decrees and laws I am setting before you today.
05012001 These are the decrees and laws you must be careful to follow in the land that the Lord, the God of your ancestors, has given you to possess—as long as you live in the land.
05012002 Destroy completely all the places on the high mountains, on the hills and under every spreading tree, where the nations you are dispossessing worship their gods.
05012003 Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and burn their Asherah poles in the fire; cut down the idols of their gods and wipe out their names from those places.
05012004 You must not worship the Lord your God in their way.
05012005 But you are to seek the place the Lord your God will choose from among all your tribes to put his Name there for his dwelling. To that place you must go;
05012006 there bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, what you have vowed to give and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks.
05012007 There, in the presence of the Lord your God, you and your families shall eat and shall rejoice in everything you have put your hand to, because the Lord your God has blessed you.
05012008 You are not to do as we do here today, everyone doing as they see fit,
05012009 since you have not yet reached the resting place and the inheritance the Lord your God is giving you.
05012010 But you will cross the Jordan and settle in the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, and he will give you rest from all your enemies around you so that you will live in safety.
05012011 Then to the place the Lord your God will choose as a dwelling for his Name—there you are to bring everything I command you: your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, and all the choice possessions you have vowed to the Lord.
05012012 And there rejoice before the Lord your God—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites from your towns who have no allotment or inheritance of their own.
05012013 Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings anywhere you please.
05012014 Offer them only at the place the Lord will choose in one of your tribes, and there observe everything I command you.
05012015 Nevertheless, you may slaughter your animals in any of your towns and eat as much of the meat as you want, as if it were gazelle or deer, according to the blessing the Lord your God gives you. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it.
05012016 But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.
05012017 You must not eat in your own towns the tithe of your grain and new wine and olive oil, or the firstborn of your herds and flocks, or whatever you have vowed to give, or your freewill offerings or special gifts.
05012018 Instead, you are to eat them in the presence of the Lord your God at the place the Lord your God will choose—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites from your towns—and you are to rejoice before the Lord your God in everything you put your hand to.
05012019 Be careful not to neglect the Levites as long as you live in your land.
05012020 When the Lord your God has enlarged your territory as he promised you, and you crave meat and say, “I would like some meat,” then you may eat as much of it as you want.
05012021 If the place where the Lord your God chooses to put his Name is too far away from you, you may slaughter animals from the herds and flocks the Lord has given you, as I have commanded you, and in your own towns you may eat as much of them as you want.
05012022 Eat them as you would gazelle or deer. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat.
05012023 But be sure you do not eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with the meat.
05012024 You must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.
05012025 Do not eat it, so that it may go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is right in the eyes of the Lord.
05012026 But take your consecrated things and whatever you have vowed to give, and go to the place the Lord will choose.
05012027 Present your burnt offerings on the altar of the Lord your God, both the meat and the blood. The blood of your sacrifices must be poured beside the altar of the Lord your God, but you may eat the meat.
05012028 Be careful to obey all these regulations I am giving you, so that it may always go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is good and right in the eyes of the Lord your God.
05012029 The Lord your God will cut off before you the nations you are about to invade and dispossess. But when you have driven them out and settled in their land,
05012030 and after they have been destroyed before you, be careful not to be ensnared by inquiring about their gods, saying, “How do these nations serve their gods? We will do the same.”
05012031 You must not worship the Lord your God in their way, because in worshiping their gods, they do all kinds of detestable things the Lord hates. They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as sacrifices to their gods.
05012032 See that you do all I command you; do not add to it or take away from it.
05013001 If a prophet, or one who foretells by dreams, appears among you and announces to you a sign or wonder,
05013002 and if the sign or wonder spoken of takes place, and the prophet says, “Let us follow other gods” (gods you have not known) “and let us worship them,”
05013003 you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. The Lord your God is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul.
05013004 It is the Lord your God you must follow, and him you must revere. Keep his commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to him.
05013005 That prophet or dreamer must be put to death for inciting rebellion against the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery. That prophet or dreamer tried to turn you from the way the Lord your God commanded you to follow. You must purge the evil from among you.
05013006 If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” (gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known,
05013007 gods of the peoples around you, whether near or far, from one end of the land to the other),
05013008 do not yield to them or listen to them. Show them no pity. Do not spare them or shield them.
05013009 You must certainly put them to death. Your hand must be the first in putting them to death, and then the hands of all the people.
05013010 Stone them to death, because they tried to turn you away from the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
05013011 Then all Israel will hear and be afraid, and no one among you will do such an evil thing again.
05013012 If you hear it said about one of the towns the Lord your God is giving you to live in
05013013 that troublemakers have arisen among you and have led the people of their town astray, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” (gods you have not known),
05013014 then you must inquire, probe and investigate it thoroughly. And if it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done among you,
05013015 you must certainly put to the sword all who live in that town. You must destroy it completely, both its people and its livestock.
05013016 You are to gather all the plunder of the town into the middle of the public square and completely burn the town and all its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the Lord your God. That town is to remain a ruin forever, never to be rebuilt,
05013017 and none of the condemned things are to be found in your hands. Then the Lord will turn from his fierce anger, will show you mercy, and will have compassion on you. He will increase your numbers, as he promised on oath to your ancestors—
05013018 because you obey the Lord your God by keeping all his commands that I am giving you today and doing what is right in his eyes.
05014001 You are the children of the Lord your God. Do not cut yourselves or shave the front of your heads for the dead,
05014002 for you are a people holy to the Lord your God. Out of all the peoples on the face of the earth, the Lord has chosen you to be his treasured possession.
05014003 Do not eat any detestable thing.
05014004 These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat,
05014005 the deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope and the mountain sheep.
05014006 You may eat any animal that has a divided hoof and that chews the cud.
05014007 However, of those that chew the cud or that have a divided hoof you may not eat the camel, the rabbit or the hyrax. Although they chew the cud, they do not have a divided hoof; they are ceremonially unclean for you.
05014008 The pig is also unclean; although it has a divided hoof, it does not chew the cud. You are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses.
05014009 Of all the creatures living in the water, you may eat any that has fins and scales.
05014010 But anything that does not have fins and scales you may not eat; for you it is unclean.
05014011 You may eat any clean bird.
05014012 But these you may not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture,
05014013 the red kite, the black kite, any kind of falcon,
05014014 any kind of raven,
05014015 the horned owl, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk,
05014016 the little owl, the great owl, the white owl,
05014017 the desert owl, the osprey, the cormorant,
05014018 the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe and the bat.
05014019 All flying insects are unclean to you; do not eat them.
05014020 But any winged creature that is clean you may eat.
05014021 Do not eat anything you find already dead. You may give it to the foreigner residing in any of your towns, and they may eat it, or you may sell it to any other foreigner. But you are a people holy to the Lord your God. Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.
05014022 Be sure to set aside a tenth of all that your fields produce each year.
05014023 Eat the tithe of your grain, new wine and olive oil, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks in the presence of the Lord your God at the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name, so that you may learn to revere the Lord your God always.
05014024 But if that place is too distant and you have been blessed by the Lord your God and cannot carry your tithe (because the place where the Lord will choose to put his Name is so far away),
05014025 then exchange your tithe for silver, and take the silver with you and go to the place the Lord your God will choose.
05014026 Use the silver to buy whatever you like: cattle, sheep, wine or other fermented drink, or anything you wish. Then you and your household shall eat there in the presence of the Lord your God and rejoice.
05014027 And do not neglect the Levites living in your towns, for they have no allotment or inheritance of their own.
05014028 At the end of every three years, bring all the tithes of that year’s produce and store it in your towns,
05014029 so that the Levites (who have no allotment or inheritance of their own) and the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns may come and eat and be satisfied, and so that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
05015001 At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts.
05015002 This is how it is to be done: Every creditor shall cancel any loan they have made to a fellow Israelite. They shall not require payment from anyone among their own people, because the Lord’s time for canceling debts has been proclaimed.
05015003 You may require payment from a foreigner, but you must cancel any debt your fellow Israelite owes you.
05015004 However, there need be no poor people among you, for in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess as your inheritance, he will richly bless you,
05015005 if only you fully obey the Lord your God and are careful to follow all these commands I am giving you today.
05015006 For the Lord your God will bless you as he has promised, and you will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. You will rule over many nations but none will rule over you.
05015007 If anyone is poor among your fellow Israelites in any of the towns of the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward them.
05015008 Rather, be openhanded and freely lend them whatever they need.
05015009 Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought: “The seventh year, the year for canceling debts, is near,” so that you do not show ill will toward the needy among your fellow Israelites and give them nothing. They may then appeal to the Lord against you, and you will be found guilty of sin.
05015010 Give generously to them and do so without a grudging heart; then because of this the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to.
05015011 There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you to be openhanded toward your fellow Israelites who are poor and needy in your land.
05015012 If any of your people—Hebrew men or women—sell themselves to you and serve you six years, in the seventh year you must let them go free.
05015013 And when you release them, do not send them away empty-handed.
05015014 Supply them liberally from your flock, your threshing floor and your winepress. Give to them as the Lord your God has blessed you.
05015015 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the Lord your God redeemed you. That is why I give you this command today.
05015016 But if your servant says to you, “I do not want to leave you,” because he loves you and your family and is well off with you,
05015017 then take an awl and push it through his earlobe into the door, and he will become your servant for life. Do the same for your female servant.
05015018 Do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free, because their service to you these six years has been worth twice as much as that of a hired hand. And the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do.
05015019 Set apart for the Lord your God every firstborn male of your herds and flocks. Do not put the firstborn of your cows to work, and do not shear the firstborn of your sheep.
05015020 Each year you and your family are to eat them in the presence of the Lord your God at the place he will choose.
05015021 If an animal has a defect, is lame or blind, or has any serious flaw, you must not sacrifice it to the Lord your God.
05015022 You are to eat it in your own towns. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it, as if it were gazelle or deer.
05015023 But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.
05016001 Observe the month of Aviv and celebrate the Passover of the Lord your God, because in the month of Aviv he brought you out of Egypt by night.
05016002 Sacrifice as the Passover to the Lord your God an animal from your flock or herd at the place the Lord will choose as a dwelling for his Name.
05016003 Do not eat it with bread made with yeast, but for seven days eat unleavened bread, the bread of affliction, because you left Egypt in haste—so that all the days of your life you may remember the time of your departure from Egypt.
05016004 Let no yeast be found in your possession in all your land for seven days. Do not let any of the meat you sacrifice on the evening of the first day remain until morning.
05016005 You must not sacrifice the Passover in any town the Lord your God gives you
05016006 except in the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name. There you must sacrifice the Passover in the evening, when the sun goes down, on the anniversary of your departure from Egypt.
05016007 Roast it and eat it at the place the Lord your God will choose. Then in the morning return to your tents.
05016008 For six days eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day hold an assembly to the Lord your God and do no work.
05016009 Count off seven weeks from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain.
05016010 Then celebrate the Festival of Weeks to the Lord your God by giving a freewill offering in proportion to the blessings the Lord your God has given you.
05016011 And rejoice before the Lord your God at the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, the Levites in your towns, and the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows living among you.
05016012 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and follow carefully these decrees.
05016013 Celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles for seven days after you have gathered the produce of your threshing floor and your winepress.
05016014 Be joyful at your festival—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites, the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns.
05016015 For seven days celebrate the festival to the Lord your God at the place the Lord will choose. For the Lord your God will bless you in all your harvest and in all the work of your hands, and your joy will be complete.
05016016 Three times a year all your men must appear before the Lord your God at the place he will choose: at the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks and the Festival of Tabernacles. No one should appear before the Lord empty-handed:
05016017 Each of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way the Lord your God has blessed you.
05016018 Appoint judges and officials for each of your tribes in every town the Lord your God is giving you, and they shall judge the people fairly.
05016019 Do not pervert justice or show partiality. Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the innocent.
05016020 Follow justice and justice alone, so that you may live and possess the land the Lord your God is giving you.
05016021 Do not set up any wooden Asherah pole beside the altar you build to the Lord your God,
05016022 and do not erect a sacred stone, for these the Lord your God hates.
05017001 Do not sacrifice to the Lord your God an ox or a sheep that has any defect or flaw in it, for that would be detestable to him.
05017002 If a man or woman living among you in one of the towns the Lord gives you is found doing evil in the eyes of the Lord your God in violation of his covenant,
05017003 and contrary to my command has worshiped other gods, bowing down to them or to the sun or the moon or the stars in the sky,
05017004 and this has been brought to your attention, then you must investigate it thoroughly. If it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done in Israel,
05017005 take the man or woman who has done this evil deed to your city gate and stone that person to death.
05017006 On the testimony of two or three witnesses a person is to be put to death, but no one is to be put to death on the testimony of only one witness.
05017007 The hands of the witnesses must be the first in putting that person to death, and then the hands of all the people. You must purge the evil from among you.
05017008 If cases come before your courts that are too difficult for you to judge—whether bloodshed, lawsuits or assaults—take them to the place the Lord your God will choose.
05017009 Go to the Levitical priests and to the judge who is in office at that time. Inquire of them and they will give you the verdict.
05017010 You must act according to the decisions they give you at the place the Lord will choose. Be careful to do everything they instruct you to do.
05017011 Act according to whatever they teach you and the decisions they give you. Do not turn aside from what they tell you, to the right or to the left.
05017012 Anyone who shows contempt for the judge or for the priest who stands ministering there to the Lord your God is to be put to death. You must purge the evil from Israel.
05017013 All the people will hear and be afraid, and will not be contemptuous again.
05017014 When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you and have taken possession of it and settled in it, and you say, “Let us set a king over us like all the nations around us,”
05017015 be sure to appoint over you a king the Lord your God chooses. He must be from among your fellow Israelites. Do not place a foreigner over you, one who is not an Israelite.
05017016 The king, moreover, must not acquire great numbers of horses for himself or make the people return to Egypt to get more of them, for the Lord has told you, “You are not to go back that way again.”
05017017 He must not take many wives, or his heart will be led astray. He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold.
05017018 When he takes the throne of his kingdom, he is to write for himself on a scroll a copy of this law, taken from that of the Levitical priests.
05017019 It is to be with him, and he is to read it all the days of his life so that he may learn to revere the Lord his God and follow carefully all the words of this law and these decrees
05017020 and not consider himself better than his fellow Israelites and turn from the law to the right or to the left. Then he and his descendants will reign a long time over his kingdom in Israel.
05018001 The Levitical priests—indeed, the whole tribe of Levi—are to have no allotment or inheritance with Israel. They shall live on the food offerings presented to the Lord, for that is their inheritance.
05018002 They shall have no inheritance among their fellow Israelites; the Lord is their inheritance, as he promised them.
05018003 This is the share due the priests from the people who sacrifice a bull or a sheep: the shoulder, the internal organs and the meat from the head.
05018004 You are to give them the firstfruits of your grain, new wine and olive oil, and the first wool from the shearing of your sheep,
05018005 for the Lord your God has chosen them and their descendants out of all your tribes to stand and minister in the Lord’s name always.
05018006 If a Levite moves from one of your towns anywhere in Israel where he is living, and comes in all earnestness to the place the Lord will choose,
05018007 he may minister in the name of the Lord his God like all his fellow Levites who serve there in the presence of the Lord.
05018008 He is to share equally in their benefits, even though he has received money from the sale of family possessions.
05018009 When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there.
05018010 Let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft,
05018011 or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead.
05018012 Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord; because of these same detestable practices the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you.
05018013 You must be blameless before the Lord your God.
05018014 The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery or divination. But as for you, the Lord your God has not permitted you to do so.
05018015 The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your fellow Israelites. You must listen to him.
05018016 For this is what you asked of the Lord your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said, “Let us not hear the voice of the Lord our God nor see this great fire anymore, or we will die.”
05018017 The Lord said to me: “What they say is good.
05018018 I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their fellow Israelites, and I will put my words in his mouth. He will tell them everything I command him.
05018019 I myself will call to account anyone who does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name.
05018020 But a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded, or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, is to be put to death.”
05018021 You may say to yourselves, “How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the Lord?”
05018022 If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the Lord does not take place or come true, that is a message the Lord has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously, so do not be alarmed.
05019001 When the Lord your God has destroyed the nations whose land he is giving you, and when you have driven them out and settled in their towns and houses,
05019002 then set aside for yourselves three cities in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess.
05019003 Determine the distances involved and divide into three parts the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, so that a person who kills someone may flee for refuge to one of these cities.
05019004 This is the rule concerning anyone who kills a person and flees there for safety—anyone who kills a neighbor unintentionally, without malice aforethought.
05019005 For instance, a man may go into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and as he swings his ax to fell a tree, the head may fly off and hit his neighbor and kill him. That man may flee to one of these cities and save his life.
05019006 Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue him in a rage, overtake him if the distance is too great, and kill him even though he is not deserving of death, since he did it to his neighbor without malice aforethought.
05019007 This is why I command you to set aside for yourselves three cities.
05019008 If the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as he promised on oath to your ancestors, and gives you the whole land he promised them,
05019009 because you carefully follow all these laws I command you today—to love the Lord your God and to walk always in obedience to him—then you are to set aside three more cities.
05019010 Do this so that innocent blood will not be shed in your land, which the Lord your God is giving you as your inheritance, and so that you will not be guilty of bloodshed.
05019011 But if out of hate someone lies in wait, assaults and kills a neighbor, and then flees to one of these cities,
05019012 the killer shall be sent for by the town elders, be brought back from the city, and be handed over to the avenger of blood to die.
05019013 Show no pity. You must purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood, so that it may go well with you.
05019014 Do not move your neighbor’s boundary stone set up by your predecessors in the inheritance you receive in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess.
05019015 One witness is not enough to convict anyone accused of any crime or offense they may have committed. A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
05019016 If a malicious witness takes the stand to accuse someone of a crime,
05019017 the two people involved in the dispute must stand in the presence of the Lord before the priests and the judges who are in office at the time.
05019018 The judges must make a thorough investigation, and if the witness proves to be a liar, giving false testimony against a fellow Israelite,
05019019 then do to the false witness as that witness intended to do to the other party. You must purge the evil from among you.
05019020 The rest of the people will hear of this and be afraid, and never again will such an evil thing be done among you.
05019021 Show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
05020001 When you go to war against your enemies and see horses and chariots and an army greater than yours, do not be afraid of them, because the Lord your God, who brought you up out of Egypt, will be with you.
05020002 When you are about to go into battle, the priest shall come forward and address the army.
05020003 He shall say: “Hear, Israel: Today you are going into battle against your enemies. Do not be fainthearted or afraid; do not panic or be terrified by them.
05020004 For the Lord your God is the one who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you victory.”
05020005 The officers shall say to the army: “Has anyone built a new house and not yet begun to live in it? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else may begin to live in it.
05020006 Has anyone planted a vineyard and not begun to enjoy it? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else enjoy it.
05020007 Has anyone become pledged to a woman and not married her? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else marry her.”
05020008 Then the officers shall add, “Is anyone afraid or fainthearted? Let him go home so that his fellow soldiers will not become disheartened too.”
05020009 When the officers have finished speaking to the army, they shall appoint commanders over it.
05020010 When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace.
05020011 If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you.
05020012 If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city.
05020013 When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it.
05020014 As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the Lord your God gives you from your enemies.
05020015 This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby.
05020016 However, in the cities of the nations the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes.
05020017 Completely destroy them—the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—as the Lord your God has commanded you.
05020018 Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do in worshiping their gods, and you will sin against the Lord your God.
05020019 When you lay siege to a city for a long time, fighting against it to capture it, do not destroy its trees by putting an ax to them, because you can eat their fruit. Do not cut them down. Are the trees people, that you should besiege them?
05020020 However, you may cut down trees that you know are not fruit trees and use them to build siege works until the city at war with you falls.
05021001 If someone is found slain, lying in a field in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess, and it is not known who the killer was,
05021002 your elders and judges shall go out and measure the distance from the body to the neighboring towns.
05021003 Then the elders of the town nearest the body shall take a heifer that has never been worked and has never worn a yoke
05021004 and lead it down to a valley that has not been plowed or planted and where there is a flowing stream. There in the valley they are to break the heifer’s neck.
05021005 The Levitical priests shall step forward, for the Lord your God has chosen them to minister and to pronounce blessings in the name of the Lord and to decide all cases of dispute and assault.
05021006 Then all the elders of the town nearest the body shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley,
05021007 and they shall declare: “Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it done.
05021008 Accept this atonement for your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, Lord, and do not hold your people guilty of the blood of an innocent person.” Then the bloodshed will be atoned for,
05021009 and you will have purged from yourselves the guilt of shedding innocent blood, since you have done what is right in the eyes of the Lord.
05021010 When you go to war against your enemies and the Lord your God delivers them into your hands and you take captives,
05021011 if you notice among the captives a beautiful woman and are attracted to her, you may take her as your wife.
05021012 Bring her into your home and have her shave her head, trim her nails
05021013 and put aside the clothes she was wearing when captured. After she has lived in your house and mourned her father and mother for a full month, then you may go to her and be her husband and she shall be your wife.
05021014 If you are not pleased with her, let her go wherever she wishes. You must not sell her or treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her.
05021015 If a man has two wives, and he loves one but not the other, and both bear him sons but the firstborn is the son of the wife he does not love,
05021016 when he wills his property to his sons, he must not give the rights of the firstborn to the son of the wife he loves in preference to his actual firstborn, the son of the wife he does not love.
05021017 He must acknowledge the son of his unloved wife as the firstborn by giving him a double share of all he has. That son is the first sign of his father’s strength. The right of the firstborn belongs to him.
05021018 If someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him,
05021019 his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town.
05021020 They shall say to the elders, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.”
05021021 Then all the men of his town are to stone him to death. You must purge the evil from among you. All Israel will hear of it and be afraid.
05021022 If someone guilty of a capital offense is put to death and their body is exposed on a pole,
05021023 you must not leave the body hanging on the pole overnight. Be sure to bury it that same day, because anyone who is hung on a pole is under God’s curse. You must not desecrate the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance.
05022001 If you see your fellow Israelite’s ox or sheep straying, do not ignore it but be sure to take it back to its owner.
05022002 If they do not live near you or if you do not know who owns it, take it home with you and keep it until they come looking for it. Then give it back.
05022003 Do the same if you find their donkey or cloak or anything else they have lost. Do not ignore it.
05022004 If you see your fellow Israelite’s donkey or ox fallen on the road, do not ignore it. Help the owner get it to its feet.
05022005 A woman must not wear men’s clothing, nor a man wear women’s clothing, for the Lord your God detests anyone who does this.
05022006 If you come across a bird’s nest beside the road, either in a tree or on the ground, and the mother is sitting on the young or on the eggs, do not take the mother with the young.
05022007 You may take the young, but be sure to let the mother go, so that it may go well with you and you may have a long life.
05022008 When you build a new house, make a parapet around your roof so that you may not bring the guilt of bloodshed on your house if someone falls from the roof.
05022009 Do not plant two kinds of seed in your vineyard; if you do, not only the crops you plant but also the fruit of the vineyard will be defiled.
05022010 Do not plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together.
05022011 Do not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together.
05022012 Make tassels on the four corners of the cloak you wear.
05022013 If a man takes a wife and, after sleeping with her, dislikes her
05022014 and slanders her and gives her a bad name, saying, “I married this woman, but when I approached her, I did not find proof of her virginity,”
05022015 then the young woman’s father and mother shall bring to the town elders at the gate proof that she was a virgin.
05022016 Her father will say to the elders, “I gave my daughter in marriage to this man, but he dislikes her.
05022017 Now he has slandered her and said, ‘I did not find your daughter to be a virgin.’ But here is the proof of my daughter’s virginity.” Then her parents shall display the cloth before the elders of the town,
05022018 and the elders shall take the man and punish him.
05022019 They shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver and give them to the young woman’s father, because this man has given an Israelite virgin a bad name. She shall continue to be his wife; he must not divorce her as long as he lives.
05022020 If, however, the charge is true and no proof of the young woman’s virginity can be found,
05022021 she shall be brought to the door of her father’s house and there the men of her town shall stone her to death. She has done an outrageous thing in Israel by being promiscuous while still in her father’s house. You must purge the evil from among you.
05022022 If a man is found sleeping with another man’s wife, both the man who slept with her and the woman must die. You must purge the evil from Israel.
05022023 If a man happens to meet in a town a virgin pledged to be married and he sleeps with her,
05022024 you shall take both of them to the gate of that town and stone them to death—the young woman because she was in a town and did not scream for help, and the man because he violated another man’s wife. You must purge the evil from among you.
05022025 But if out in the country a man happens to meet a young woman pledged to be married and rapes her, only the man who has done this shall die.
05022026 Do nothing to the woman; she has committed no sin deserving death. This case is like that of someone who attacks and murders a neighbor,
05022027 for the man found the young woman out in the country, and though the betrothed woman screamed, there was no one to rescue her.
05022028 If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered,
05022029 he shall pay her father fifty shekels of silver. He must marry the young woman, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives.
05022030 A man is not to marry his father’s wife; he must not dishonor his father’s bed.
05023001 No one who has been emasculated by crushing or cutting may enter the assembly of the Lord.
05023002 No one born of a forbidden marriage nor any of their descendants may enter the assembly of the Lord, not even in the tenth generation.
05023003 No Ammonite or Moabite or any of their descendants may enter the assembly of the Lord, not even in the tenth generation.
05023004 For they did not come to meet you with bread and water on your way when you came out of Egypt, and they hired Balaam son of Beor from Pethor in Aram Naharaim to pronounce a curse on you.
05023005 However, the Lord your God would not listen to Balaam but turned the curse into a blessing for you, because the Lord your God loves you.
05023006 Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them as long as you live.
05023007 Do not despise an Edomite, for the Edomites are related to you. Do not despise an Egyptian, because you resided as foreigners in their country.
05023008 The third generation of children born to them may enter the assembly of the Lord.
05023009 When you are encamped against your enemies, keep away from everything impure.
05023010 If one of your men is unclean because of a nocturnal emission, he is to go outside the camp and stay there.
05023011 But as evening approaches he is to wash himself, and at sunset he may return to the camp.
05023012 Designate a place outside the camp where you can go to relieve yourself.
05023013 As part of your equipment have something to dig with, and when you relieve yourself, dig a hole and cover up your excrement.
05023014 For the Lord your God moves about in your camp to protect you and to deliver your enemies to you. Your camp must be holy, so that he will not see among you anything indecent and turn away from you.
05023015 If a slave has taken refuge with you, do not hand them over to their master.
05023016 Let them live among you wherever they like and in whatever town they choose. Do not oppress them.
05023017 No Israelite man or woman is to become a shrine prostitute.
05023018 You must not bring the earnings of a female prostitute or of a male prostitute into the house of the Lord your God to pay any vow, because the Lord your God detests them both.
05023019 Do not charge a fellow Israelite interest, whether on money or food or anything else that may earn interest.
05023020 You may charge a foreigner interest, but not a fellow Israelite, so that the Lord your God may bless you in everything you put your hand to in the land you are entering to possess.
05023021 If you make a vow to the Lord your God, do not be slow to pay it, for the Lord your God will certainly demand it of you and you will be guilty of sin.
05023022 But if you refrain from making a vow, you will not be guilty.
05023023 Whatever your lips utter you must be sure to do, because you made your vow freely to the Lord your God with your own mouth.
05023024 If you enter your neighbor’s vineyard, you may eat all the grapes you want, but do not put any in your basket.
05023025 If you enter your neighbor’s grainfield, you may pick kernels with your hands, but you must not put a sickle to their standing grain.
05024001 If a man marries a woman who becomes displeasing to him because he finds something indecent about her, and he writes her a certificate of divorce, gives it to her and sends her from his house,
05024002 and if after she leaves his house she becomes the wife of another man,
05024003 and her second husband dislikes her and writes her a certificate of divorce, gives it to her and sends her from his house, or if he dies,
05024004 then her first husband, who divorced her, is not allowed to marry her again after she has been defiled. That would be detestable in the eyes of the Lord. Do not bring sin upon the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance.
05024005 If a man has recently married, he must not be sent to war or have any other duty laid on him. For one year he is to be free to stay at home and bring happiness to the wife he has married.
05024006 Do not take a pair of millstones—not even the upper one—as security for a debt, because that would be taking a person’s livelihood as security.
05024007 If someone is caught kidnapping a fellow Israelite and treating or selling them as a slave, the kidnapper must die. You must purge the evil from among you.
05024008 In cases of defiling skin diseases, be very careful to do exactly as the Levitical priests instruct you. You must follow carefully what I have commanded them.
05024009 Remember what the Lord your God did to Miriam along the way after you came out of Egypt.
05024010 When you make a loan of any kind to your neighbor, do not go into their house to get what is offered to you as a pledge.
05024011 Stay outside and let the neighbor to whom you are making the loan bring the pledge out to you.
05024012 If the neighbor is poor, do not go to sleep with their pledge in your possession.
05024013 Return their cloak by sunset so that your neighbor may sleep in it. Then they will thank you, and it will be regarded as a righteous act in the sight of the Lord your God.
05024014 Do not take advantage of a hired worker who is poor and needy, whether that worker is a fellow Israelite or a foreigner residing in one of your towns.
05024015 Pay them their wages each day before sunset, because they are poor and are counting on it. Otherwise they may cry to the Lord against you, and you will be guilty of sin.
05024016 Parents are not to be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their parents; each will die for their own sin.
05024017 Do not deprive the foreigner or the fatherless of justice, or take the cloak of the widow as a pledge.
05024018 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the Lord your God redeemed you from there. That is why I command you to do this.
05024019 When you are harvesting in your field and you overlook a sheaf, do not go back to get it. Leave it for the foreigner, the fatherless and the widow, so that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
05024020 When you beat the olives from your trees, do not go over the branches a second time. Leave what remains for the foreigner, the fatherless and the widow.
05024021 When you harvest the grapes in your vineyard, do not go over the vines again. Leave what remains for the foreigner, the fatherless and the widow.
05024022 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt. That is why I command you to do this.
05025001 When people have a dispute, they are to take it to court and the judges will decide the case, acquitting the innocent and condemning the guilty.
05025002 If the guilty person deserves to be beaten, the judge shall make them lie down and have them flogged in his presence with the number of lashes the crime deserves,
05025003 but the judge must not impose more than forty lashes. If the guilty party is flogged more than that, your fellow Israelite will be degraded in your eyes.
05025004 Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.
05025005 If brothers are living together and one of them dies without a son, his widow must not marry outside the family. Her husband’s brother shall take her and marry her and fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law to her.
05025006 The first son she bears shall carry on the name of the dead brother so that his name will not be blotted out from Israel.
05025007 However, if a man does not want to marry his brother’s wife, she shall go to the elders at the town gate and say, “My husband’s brother refuses to carry on his brother’s name in Israel. He will not fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law to me.”
05025008 Then the elders of his town shall summon him and talk to him. If he persists in saying, “I do not want to marry her,”
05025009 his brother’s widow shall go up to him in the presence of the elders, take off one of his sandals, spit in his face and say, “This is what is done to the man who will not build up his brother’s family line.”
05025010 That man’s line shall be known in Israel as The Family of the Unsandaled.
05025011 If two men are fighting and the wife of one of them comes to rescue her husband from his assailant, and she reaches out and seizes him by his private parts,
05025012 you shall cut off her hand. Show her no pity.
05025013 Do not have two differing weights in your bag—one heavy, one light.
05025014 Do not have two differing measures in your house—one large, one small.
05025015 You must have accurate and honest weights and measures, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you.
05025016 For the Lord your God detests anyone who does these things, anyone who deals dishonestly.
05025017 Remember what the Amalekites did to you along the way when you came out of Egypt.
05025018 When you were weary and worn out, they met you on your journey and attacked all who were lagging behind; they had no fear of God.
05025019 When the Lord your God gives you rest from all the enemies around you in the land he is giving you to possess as an inheritance, you shall blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven. Do not forget!
05026001 When you have entered the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance and have taken possession of it and settled in it,
05026002 take some of the firstfruits of all that you produce from the soil of the land the Lord your God is giving you and put them in a basket. Then go to the place the Lord your God will choose as a dwelling for his Name
05026003 and say to the priest in office at the time, “I declare today to the Lord your God that I have come to the land the Lord swore to our ancestors to give us.”
05026004 The priest shall take the basket from your hands and set it down in front of the altar of the Lord your God.
05026005 Then you shall declare before the Lord your God: “My father was a wandering Aramean, and he went down into Egypt with a few people and lived there and became a great nation, powerful and numerous.
05026006 But the Egyptians mistreated us and made us suffer, subjecting us to harsh labor.
05026007 Then we cried out to the Lord, the God of our ancestors, and the Lord heard our voice and saw our misery, toil and oppression.
05026008 So the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with great terror and with signs and wonders.
05026009 He brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey;
05026010 and now I bring the firstfruits of the soil that you, Lord, have given me.” Place the basket before the Lord your God and bow down before him.
05026011 Then you and the Levites and the foreigners residing among you shall rejoice in all the good things the Lord your God has given to you and your household.
05026012 When you have finished setting aside a tenth of all your produce in the third year, the year of the tithe, you shall give it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless and the widow, so that they may eat in your towns and be satisfied.
05026013 Then say to the Lord your God: “I have removed from my house the sacred portion and have given it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless and the widow, according to all you commanded. I have not turned aside from your commands nor have I forgotten any of them.
05026014 I have not eaten any of the sacred portion while I was in mourning, nor have I removed any of it while I was unclean, nor have I offered any of it to the dead. I have obeyed the Lord my God; I have done everything you commanded me.
05026015 Look down from heaven, your holy dwelling place, and bless your people Israel and the land you have given us as you promised on oath to our ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey.”
05026016 The Lord your God commands you this day to follow these decrees and laws; carefully observe them with all your heart and with all your soul.
05026017 You have declared this day that the Lord is your God and that you will walk in obedience to him, that you will keep his decrees, commands and laws—that you will listen to him.
05026018 And the Lord has declared this day that you are his people, his treasured possession as he promised, and that you are to keep all his commands.
05026019 He has declared that he will set you in praise, fame and honor high above all the nations he has made and that you will be a people holy to the Lord your God, as he promised.
05027001 Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people: “Keep all these commands that I give you today.
05027002 When you have crossed the Jordan into the land the Lord your God is giving you, set up some large stones and coat them with plaster.
05027003 Write on them all the words of this law when you have crossed over to enter the land the Lord your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, promised you.
05027004 And when you have crossed the Jordan, set up these stones on Mount Ebal, as I command you today, and coat them with plaster.
05027005 Build there an altar to the Lord your God, an altar of stones. Do not use any iron tool on them.
05027006 Build the altar of the Lord your God with fieldstones and offer burnt offerings on it to the Lord your God.
05027007 Sacrifice fellowship offerings there, eating them and rejoicing in the presence of the Lord your God.
05027008 And you shall write very clearly all the words of this law on these stones you have set up.”
05027009 Then Moses and the Levitical priests said to all Israel, “Be silent, Israel, and listen! You have now become the people of the Lord your God.
05027010 Obey the Lord your God and follow his commands and decrees that I give you today.”
05027011 On the same day Moses commanded the people:
05027012 When you have crossed the Jordan, these tribes shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph and Benjamin.
05027013 And these tribes shall stand on Mount Ebal to pronounce curses: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan and Naphtali.
05027014 The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud voice:
05027015 “Cursed is anyone who makes an idol—a thing detestable to the Lord, the work of skilled hands—and sets it up in secret.” Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
05027016 “Cursed is anyone who dishonors their father or mother.” Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
05027017 “Cursed is anyone who moves their neighbor’s boundary stone.” Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
05027018 “Cursed is anyone who leads the blind astray on the road.” Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
05027019 “Cursed is anyone who withholds justice from the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow.” Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
05027020 “Cursed is anyone who sleeps with his father’s wife, for he dishonors his father’s bed.” Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
05027021 “Cursed is anyone who has sexual relations with any animal.” Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
05027022 “Cursed is anyone who sleeps with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother.” Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
05027023 “Cursed is anyone who sleeps with his mother-in-law.” Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
05027024 “Cursed is anyone who kills their neighbor secretly.” Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
05027025 “Cursed is anyone who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person.” Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
05027026 “Cursed is anyone who does not uphold the words of this law by carrying them out.” Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
05028001 If you fully obey the Lord your God and carefully follow all his commands I give you today, the Lord your God will set you high above all the nations on earth.
05028002 All these blessings will come on you and accompany you if you obey the Lord your God:
05028003 You will be blessed in the city and blessed in the country.
05028004 The fruit of your womb will be blessed, and the crops of your land and the young of your livestock—the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks.
05028005 Your basket and your kneading trough will be blessed.
05028006 You will be blessed when you come in and blessed when you go out.
05028007 The Lord will grant that the enemies who rise up against you will be defeated before you. They will come at you from one direction but flee from you in seven.
05028008 The Lord will send a blessing on your barns and on everything you put your hand to. The Lord your God will bless you in the land he is giving you.
05028009 The Lord will establish you as his holy people, as he promised you on oath, if you keep the commands of the Lord your God and walk in obedience to him.
05028010 Then all the peoples on earth will see that you are called by the name of the Lord, and they will fear you.
05028011 The Lord will grant you abundant prosperity—in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock and the crops of your ground—in the land he swore to your ancestors to give you.
05028012 The Lord will open the heavens, the storehouse of his bounty, to send rain on your land in season and to bless all the work of your hands. You will lend to many nations but will borrow from none.
05028013 The Lord will make you the head, not the tail. If you pay attention to the commands of the Lord your God that I give you this day and carefully follow them, you will always be at the top, never at the bottom.
05028014 Do not turn aside from any of the commands I give you today, to the right or to the left, following other gods and serving them.
05028015 However, if you do not obey the Lord your God and do not carefully follow all his commands and decrees I am giving you today, all these curses will come on you and overtake you:
05028016 You will be cursed in the city and cursed in the country.
05028017 Your basket and your kneading trough will be cursed.
05028018 The fruit of your womb will be cursed, and the crops of your land, and the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks.
05028019 You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out.
05028020 The Lord will send on you curses, confusion and rebuke in everything you put your hand to, until you are destroyed and come to sudden ruin because of the evil you have done in forsaking him.
05028021 The Lord will plague you with diseases until he has destroyed you from the land you are entering to possess.
05028022 The Lord will strike you with wasting disease, with fever and inflammation, with scorching heat and drought, with blight and mildew, which will plague you until you perish.
05028023 The sky over your head will be bronze, the ground beneath you iron.
05028024 The Lord will turn the rain of your country into dust and powder; it will come down from the skies until you are destroyed.
05028025 The Lord will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. You will come at them from one direction but flee from them in seven, and you will become a thing of horror to all the kingdoms on earth.
05028026 Your carcasses will be food for all the birds and the wild animals, and there will be no one to frighten them away.
05028027 The Lord will afflict you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors, festering sores and the itch, from which you cannot be cured.
05028028 The Lord will afflict you with madness, blindness and confusion of mind.
05028029 At midday you will grope about like a blind person in the dark. You will be unsuccessful in everything you do; day after day you will be oppressed and robbed, with no one to rescue you.
05028030 You will be pledged to be married to a woman, but another will take her and rape her. You will build a house, but you will not live in it. You will plant a vineyard, but you will not even begin to enjoy its fruit.
05028031 Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will eat none of it. Your donkey will be forcibly taken from you and will not be returned. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and no one will rescue them.
05028032 Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation, and you will wear out your eyes watching for them day after day, powerless to lift a hand.
05028033 A people that you do not know will eat what your land and labor produce, and you will have nothing but cruel oppression all your days.
05028034 The sights you see will drive you mad.
05028035 The Lord will afflict your knees and legs with painful boils that cannot be cured, spreading from the soles of your feet to the top of your head.
05028036 The Lord will drive you and the king you set over you to a nation unknown to you or your ancestors. There you will worship other gods, gods of wood and stone.
05028037 You will become a thing of horror, a byword and an object of ridicule among all the peoples where the Lord will drive you.
05028038 You will sow much seed in the field but you will harvest little, because locusts will devour it.
05028039 You will plant vineyards and cultivate them but you will not drink the wine or gather the grapes, because worms will eat them.
05028040 You will have olive trees throughout your country but you will not use the oil, because the olives will drop off.
05028041 You will have sons and daughters but you will not keep them, because they will go into captivity.
05028042 Swarms of locusts will take over all your trees and the crops of your land.
05028043 The foreigners who reside among you will rise above you higher and higher, but you will sink lower and lower.
05028044 They will lend to you, but you will not lend to them. They will be the head, but you will be the tail.
05028045 All these curses will come on you. They will pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed, because you did not obey the Lord your God and observe the commands and decrees he gave you.
05028046 They will be a sign and a wonder to you and your descendants forever.
05028047 Because you did not serve the Lord your God joyfully and gladly in the time of prosperity,
05028048 therefore in hunger and thirst, in nakedness and dire poverty, you will serve the enemies the Lord sends against you. He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you.
05028049 The Lord will bring a nation against you from far away, from the ends of the earth, like an eagle swooping down, a nation whose language you will not understand,
05028050 a fierce-looking nation without respect for the old or pity for the young.
05028051 They will devour the young of your livestock and the crops of your land until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain, new wine or olive oil, nor any calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks until you are ruined.
05028052 They will lay siege to all the cities throughout your land until the high fortified walls in which you trust fall down. They will besiege all the cities throughout the land the Lord your God is giving you.
05028053 Because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege, you will eat the fruit of the womb, the flesh of the sons and daughters the Lord your God has given you.
05028054 Even the most gentle and sensitive man among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his surviving children,
05028055 and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating. It will be all he has left because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of all your cities.
05028056 The most gentle and sensitive woman among you—so sensitive and gentle that she would not venture to touch the ground with the sole of her foot—will begrudge the husband she loves and her own son or daughter
05028057 the afterbirth from her womb and the children she bears. For in her dire need she intends to eat them secretly because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of your cities.
05028058 If you do not carefully follow all the words of this law, which are written in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome name—the Lord your God—
05028059 the Lord will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants, harsh and prolonged disasters, and severe and lingering illnesses.
05028060 He will bring on you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will cling to you.
05028061 The Lord will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this Book of the Law, until you are destroyed.
05028062 You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few in number, because you did not obey the Lord your God.
05028063 Just as it pleased the Lord to make you prosper and increase in number, so it will please him to ruin and destroy you. You will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess.
05028064 Then the Lord will scatter you among all nations, from one end of the earth to the other. There you will worship other gods—gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your ancestors have known.
05028065 Among those nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the Lord will give you an anxious mind, eyes weary with longing, and a despairing heart.
05028066 You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life.
05028067 In the morning you will say, “If only it were evening!” and in the evening, “If only it were morning!”—because of the terror that will fill your hearts and the sights that your eyes will see.
05028068 The Lord will send you back in ships to Egypt on a journey I said you should never make again. There you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.
05029001 These are the terms of the covenant the Lord commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in Moab, in addition to the covenant he had made with them at Horeb.
05029002 Moses summoned all the Israelites and said to them: Your eyes have seen all that the Lord did in Egypt to Pharaoh, to all his officials and to all his land.
05029003 With your own eyes you saw those great trials, those signs and great wonders.
05029004 But to this day the Lord has not given you a mind that understands or eyes that see or ears that hear.
05029005 Yet the Lord says, “During the forty years that I led you through the wilderness, your clothes did not wear out, nor did the sandals on your feet.
05029006 You ate no bread and drank no wine or other fermented drink. I did this so that you might know that I am the Lord your God.”
05029007 When you reached this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out to fight against us, but we defeated them.
05029008 We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
05029009 Carefully follow the terms of this covenant, so that you may prosper in everything you do.
05029010 All of you are standing today in the presence of the Lord your God—your leaders and chief men, your elders and officials, and all the other men of Israel,
05029011 together with your children and your wives, and the foreigners living in your camps who chop your wood and carry your water.
05029012 You are standing here in order to enter into a covenant with the Lord your God, a covenant the Lord is making with you this day and sealing with an oath,
05029013 to confirm you this day as his people, that he may be your God as he promised you and as he swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
05029014 I am making this covenant, with its oath, not only with you
05029015 who are standing here with us today in the presence of the Lord our God but also with those who are not here today.
05029016 You yourselves know how we lived in Egypt and how we passed through the countries on the way here.
05029017 You saw among them their detestable images and idols of wood and stone, of silver and gold.
05029018 Make sure there is no man or woman, clan or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the Lord our God to go and worship the gods of those nations; make sure there is no root among you that produces such bitter poison.
05029019 When such a person hears the words of this oath and they invoke a blessing on themselves, thinking, “I will be safe, even though I persist in going my own way,” they will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry.
05029020 The Lord will never be willing to forgive them; his wrath and zeal will burn against them. All the curses written in this book will fall on them, and the Lord will blot out their names from under heaven.
05029021 The Lord will single them out from all the tribes of Israel for disaster, according to all the curses of the covenant written in this Book of the Law.
05029022 Your children who follow you in later generations and foreigners who come from distant lands will see the calamities that have fallen on the land and the diseases with which the Lord has afflicted it.
05029023 The whole land will be a burning waste of salt and sulfur—nothing planted, nothing sprouting, no vegetation growing on it. It will be like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboyim, which the Lord overthrew in fierce anger.
05029024 All the nations will ask: “Why has the Lord done this to this land? Why this fierce, burning anger?”
05029025 And the answer will be: “It is because this people abandoned the covenant of the Lord, the God of their ancestors, the covenant he made with them when he brought them out of Egypt.
05029026 They went off and worshiped other gods and bowed down to them, gods they did not know, gods he had not given them.
05029027 Therefore the Lord’s anger burned against this land, so that he brought on it all the curses written in this book.
05029028 In furious anger and in great wrath the Lord uprooted them from their land and thrust them into another land, as it is now.”
05029029 The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this law.
05030001 When all these blessings and curses I have set before you come on you and you take them to heart wherever the Lord your God disperses you among the nations,
05030002 and when you and your children return to the Lord your God and obey him with all your heart and with all your soul according to everything I command you today,
05030003 then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you and gather you again from all the nations where he scattered you.
05030004 Even if you have been banished to the most distant land under the heavens, from there the Lord your God will gather you and bring you back.
05030005 He will bring you to the land that belonged to your ancestors, and you will take possession of it. He will make you more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors.
05030006 The Lord your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants, so that you may love him with all your heart and with all your soul, and live.
05030007 The Lord your God will put all these curses on your enemies who hate and persecute you.
05030008 You will again obey the Lord and follow all his commands I am giving you today.
05030009 Then the Lord your God will make you most prosperous in all the work of your hands and in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock and the crops of your land. The Lord will again delight in you and make you prosperous, just as he delighted in your ancestors,
05030010 if you obey the Lord your God and keep his commands and decrees that are written in this Book of the Law and turn to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
05030011 Now what I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach.
05030012 It is not up in heaven, so that you have to ask, “Who will ascend into heaven to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?”
05030013 Nor is it beyond the sea, so that you have to ask, “Who will cross the sea to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?”
05030014 No, the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it.
05030015 See, I set before you today life and prosperity, death and destruction.
05030016 For I command you today to love the Lord your God, to walk in obedience to him, and to keep his commands, decrees and laws; then you will live and increase, and the Lord your God will bless you in the land you are entering to possess.
05030017 But if your heart turns away and you are not obedient, and if you are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them,
05030018 I declare to you this day that you will certainly be destroyed. You will not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess.
05030019 This day I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live
05030020 and that you may love the Lord your God, listen to his voice, and hold fast to him. For the Lord is your life, and he will give you many years in the land he swore to give to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
05031001 Then Moses went out and spoke these words to all Israel:
05031002 “I am now a hundred and twenty years old and I am no longer able to lead you. The Lord has said to me, ‘You shall not cross the Jordan.’
05031003 The Lord your God himself will cross over ahead of you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you will take possession of their land. Joshua also will cross over ahead of you, as the Lord said.
05031004 And the Lord will do to them what he did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, whom he destroyed along with their land.
05031005 The Lord will deliver them to you, and you must do to them all that I have commanded you.
05031006 Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the Lord your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.”
05031007 Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the presence of all Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you must go with this people into the land that the Lord swore to their ancestors to give them, and you must divide it among them as their inheritance.
05031008 The Lord himself goes before you and will be with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.”
05031009 So Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the Levitical priests, who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to all the elders of Israel.
05031010 Then Moses commanded them: “At the end of every seven years, in the year for canceling debts, during the Festival of Tabernacles,
05031011 when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God at the place he will choose, you shall read this law before them in their hearing.
05031012 Assemble the people—men, women and children, and the foreigners residing in your towns—so they can listen and learn to fear the Lord your God and follow carefully all the words of this law.
05031013 Their children, who do not know this law, must hear it and learn to fear the Lord your God as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”
05031014 The Lord said to Moses, “Now the day of your death is near. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the tent of meeting, where I will commission him.” So Moses and Joshua came and presented themselves at the tent of meeting.
05031015 Then the Lord appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the cloud stood over the entrance to the tent.
05031016 And the Lord said to Moses: “You are going to rest with your ancestors, and these people will soon prostitute themselves to the foreign gods of the land they are entering. They will forsake me and break the covenant I made with them.
05031017 And in that day I will become angry with them and forsake them; I will hide my face from them, and they will be destroyed. Many disasters and calamities will come on them, and in that day they will ask, ‘Have not these disasters come on us because our God is not with us?’
05031018 And I will certainly hide my face in that day because of all their wickedness in turning to other gods.
05031019 “Now write down this song and teach it to the Israelites and have them sing it, so that it may be a witness for me against them.
05031020 When I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, the land I promised on oath to their ancestors, and when they eat their fill and thrive, they will turn to other gods and worship them, rejecting me and breaking my covenant.
05031021 And when many disasters and calamities come on them, this song will testify against them, because it will not be forgotten by their descendants. I know what they are disposed to do, even before I bring them into the land I promised them on oath.”
05031022 So Moses wrote down this song that day and taught it to the Israelites.
05031023 The Lord gave this command to Joshua son of Nun: “Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the Israelites into the land I promised them on oath, and I myself will be with you.”
05031024 After Moses finished writing in a book the words of this law from beginning to end,
05031025 he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord:
05031026 “Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God. There it will remain as a witness against you.
05031027 For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you have been rebellious against the Lord while I am still alive and with you, how much more will you rebel after I die!
05031028 Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and all your officials, so that I can speak these words in their hearing and call the heavens and the earth to testify against them.
05031029 For I know that after my death you are sure to become utterly corrupt and to turn from the way I have commanded you. In days to come, disaster will fall on you because you will do evil in the sight of the Lord and arouse his anger by what your hands have made.”
05031030 And Moses recited the words of this song from beginning to end in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel:
05032001 Listen, you heavens, and I will speak; hear, you earth, the words of my mouth.
05032002 Let my teaching fall like rain and my words descend like dew, like showers on new grass, like abundant rain on tender plants.
05032003 I will proclaim the name of the Lord. Oh, praise the greatness of our God!
05032004 He is the Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just. A faithful God who does no wrong, upright and just is he.
05032005 They are corrupt and not his children; to their shame they are a warped and crooked generation.
05032006 Is this the way you repay the Lord, you foolish and unwise people? Is he not your Father, your Creator, who made you and formed you?
05032007 Remember the days of old; consider the generations long past. Ask your father and he will tell you, your elders, and they will explain to you.
05032008 When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when he divided all mankind, he set up boundaries for the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel.
05032009 For the Lord’s portion is his people, Jacob his allotted inheritance.
05032010 In a desert land he found him, in a barren and howling waste. He shielded him and cared for him; he guarded him as the apple of his eye,
05032011 like an eagle that stirs up its nest and hovers over its young, that spreads its wings to catch them and carries them aloft.
05032012 The Lord alone led him; no foreign god was with him.
05032013 He made him ride on the heights of the land and fed him with the fruit of the fields. He nourished him with honey from the rock, and with oil from the flinty crag,
05032014 with curds and milk from herd and flock and with fattened lambs and goats, with choice rams of Bashan and the finest kernels of wheat. You drank the foaming blood of the grape.
05032015 Jeshurun grew fat and kicked; filled with food, they became heavy and sleek. They abandoned the God who made them and rejected the Rock their Savior.
05032016 They made him jealous with their foreign gods and angered him with their detestable idols.
05032017 They sacrificed to false gods, which are not God— gods they had not known, gods that recently appeared, gods your ancestors did not fear.
05032018 You deserted the Rock, who fathered you; you forgot the God who gave you birth.
05032019 The Lord saw this and rejected them because he was angered by his sons and daughters.
05032020 “I will hide my face from them,” he said, “and see what their end will be; for they are a perverse generation, children who are unfaithful.
05032021 They made me jealous by what is no god and angered me with their worthless idols. I will make them envious by those who are not a people; I will make them angry by a nation that has no understanding.
05032022 For a fire will be kindled by my wrath, one that burns down to the realm of the dead below. It will devour the earth and its harvests and set afire the foundations of the mountains.
05032023 “I will heap calamities on them and spend my arrows against them.
05032024 I will send wasting famine against them, consuming pestilence and deadly plague; I will send against them the fangs of wild beasts, the venom of vipers that glide in the dust.
05032025 In the street the sword will make them childless; in their homes terror will reign. The young men and young women will perish, the infants and those with gray hair.
05032026 I said I would scatter them and erase their name from human memory,
05032027 but I dreaded the taunt of the enemy, lest the adversary misunderstand and say, ‘Our hand has triumphed; the Lord has not done all this.’ ”
05032028 They are a nation without sense, there is no discernment in them.
05032029 If only they were wise and would understand this and discern what their end will be!
05032030 How could one man chase a thousand, or two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, unless the Lord had given them up?
05032031 For their rock is not like our Rock, as even our enemies concede.
05032032 Their vine comes from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are filled with poison, and their clusters with bitterness.
05032033 Their wine is the venom of serpents, the deadly poison of cobras.
05032034 “Have I not kept this in reserve and sealed it in my vaults?
05032035 It is mine to avenge; I will repay. In due time their foot will slip; their day of disaster is near and their doom rushes upon them.”
05032036 The Lord will vindicate his people and relent concerning his servants when he sees their strength is gone and no one is left, slave or free.
05032037 He will say: “Now where are their gods, the rock they took refuge in,
05032038 the gods who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings? Let them rise up to help you! Let them give you shelter!
05032039 “See now that I myself am he! There is no god besides me. I put to death and I bring to life, I have wounded and I will heal, and no one can deliver out of my hand.
05032040 I lift my hand to heaven and solemnly swear: As surely as I live forever,
05032041 when I sharpen my flashing sword and my hand grasps it in judgment, I will take vengeance on my adversaries and repay those who hate me.
05032042 I will make my arrows drunk with blood, while my sword devours flesh: the blood of the slain and the captives, the heads of the enemy leaders.”
05032043 Rejoice, you nations, with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants; he will take vengeance on his enemies and make atonement for his land and people.
05032044 Moses came with Joshua son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people.
05032045 When Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel,
05032046 he said to them, “Take to heart all the words I have solemnly declared to you this day, so that you may command your children to obey carefully all the words of this law.
05032047 They are not just idle words for you—they are your life. By them you will live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”
05032048 On that same day the Lord told Moses,
05032049 “Go up into the Abarim Range to Mount Nebo in Moab, across from Jericho, and view Canaan, the land I am giving the Israelites as their own possession.
05032050 There on the mountain that you have climbed you will die and be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people.
05032051 This is because both of you broke faith with me in the presence of the Israelites at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the Desert of Zin and because you did not uphold my holiness among the Israelites.
05032052 Therefore, you will see the land only from a distance; you will not enter the land I am giving to the people of Israel.”
05033001 This is the blessing that Moses the man of God pronounced on the Israelites before his death.
05033002 He said: “The Lord came from Sinai and dawned over them from Seir; he shone forth from Mount Paran. He came with myriads of holy ones from the south, from his mountain slopes.
05033003 Surely it is you who love the people; all the holy ones are in your hand. At your feet they all bow down, and from you receive instruction,
05033004 the law that Moses gave us, the possession of the assembly of Jacob.
05033005 He was king over Jeshurun when the leaders of the people assembled, along with the tribes of Israel.
05033006 “Let Reuben live and not die, nor his people be few.”
05033007 And this he said about Judah: “Hear, Lord, the cry of Judah; bring him to his people. With his own hands he defends his cause. Oh, be his help against his foes!”
05033008 About Levi he said: “Your Thummim and Urim belong to your faithful servant. You tested him at Massah; you contended with him at the waters of Meribah.
05033009 He said of his father and mother, ‘I have no regard for them.’ He did not recognize his brothers or acknowledge his own children, but he watched over your word and guarded your covenant.
05033010 He teaches your precepts to Jacob and your law to Israel. He offers incense before you and whole burnt offerings on your altar.
05033011 Bless all his skills, Lord, and be pleased with the work of his hands. Strike down those who rise against him, his foes till they rise no more.”
05033012 About Benjamin he said: “Let the beloved of the Lord rest secure in him, for he shields him all day long, and the one the Lord loves rests between his shoulders.”
05033013 About Joseph he said: “May the Lord bless his land with the precious dew from heaven above and with the deep waters that lie below;
05033014 with the best the sun brings forth and the finest the moon can yield;
05033015 with the choicest gifts of the ancient mountains and the fruitfulness of the everlasting hills;
05033016 with the best gifts of the earth and its fullness and the favor of him who dwelt in the burning bush. Let all these rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among his brothers.
05033017 In majesty he is like a firstborn bull; his horns are the horns of a wild ox. With them he will gore the nations, even those at the ends of the earth. Such are the ten thousands of Ephraim; such are the thousands of Manasseh.”
05033018 About Zebulun he said: “Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, and you, Issachar, in your tents.
05033019 They will summon peoples to the mountain and there offer the sacrifices of the righteous; they will feast on the abundance of the seas, on the treasures hidden in the sand.”
05033020 About Gad he said: “Blessed is he who enlarges Gad’s domain! Gad lives there like a lion, tearing at arm or head.
05033021 He chose the best land for himself; the leader’s portion was kept for him. When the heads of the people assembled, he carried out the Lord’s righteous will, and his judgments concerning Israel.”
05033022 About Dan he said: “Dan is a lion’s cub, springing out of Bashan.”
05033023 About Naphtali he said: “Naphtali is abounding with the favor of the Lord and is full of his blessing; he will inherit southward to the lake.”
05033024 About Asher he said: “Most blessed of sons is Asher; let him be favored by his brothers, and let him bathe his feet in oil.
05033025 The bolts of your gates will be iron and bronze, and your strength will equal your days.
05033026 “There is no one like the God of Jeshurun, who rides across the heavens to help you and on the clouds in his majesty.
05033027 The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms. He will drive out your enemies before you, saying, ‘Destroy them!’
05033028 So Israel will live in safety; Jacob will dwell secure in a land of grain and new wine, where the heavens drop dew.
05033029 Blessed are you, Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the Lord? He is your shield and helper and your glorious sword. Your enemies will cower before you, and you will tread on their heights.”
05034001 Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah, across from Jericho. There the Lord showed him the whole land—from Gilead to Dan,
05034002 all of Naphtali, the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Mediterranean Sea,
05034003 the Negev and the whole region from the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms, as far as Zoar.
05034004 Then the Lord said to him, “This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob when I said, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have let you see it with your eyes, but you will not cross over into it.”
05034005 And Moses the servant of the Lord died there in Moab, as the Lord had said.
05034006 He buried him in Moab, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, but to this day no one knows where his grave is.
05034007 Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, yet his eyes were not weak nor his strength gone.
05034008 The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning was over.
05034009 Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the Israelites listened to him and did what the Lord had commanded Moses.
05034010 Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face,
05034011 who did all those signs and wonders the Lord sent him to do in Egypt—to Pharaoh and to all his officials and to his whole land.
05034012 For no one has ever shown the mighty power or performed the awesome deeds that Moses did in the sight of all Israel.
06001001 After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, the Lord said to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ aide:
06001002 “Moses my servant is dead. Now then, you and all these people, get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give to them—to the Israelites.
06001003 I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses.
06001004 Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the great river, the Euphrates—all the Hittite country—to the Mediterranean Sea in the west.
06001005 No one will be able to stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you.
06001006 Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their ancestors to give them.
06001007 “Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go.
06001008 Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.
06001009 Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.”
06001010 So Joshua ordered the officers of the people:
06001011 “Go through the camp and tell the people, ‘Get your provisions ready. Three days from now you will cross the Jordan here to go in and take possession of the land the Lord your God is giving you for your own.’ ”
06001012 But to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,
06001013 “Remember the command that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you after he said, ‘The Lord your God will give you rest by giving you this land.’
06001014 Your wives, your children and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan, but all your fighting men, ready for battle, must cross over ahead of your fellow Israelites. You are to help them
06001015 until the Lord gives them rest, as he has done for you, and until they too have taken possession of the land the Lord your God is giving them. After that, you may go back and occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you east of the Jordan toward the sunrise.”
06001016 Then they answered Joshua, “Whatever you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
06001017 Just as we fully obeyed Moses, so we will obey you. Only may the Lord your God be with you as he was with Moses.
06001018 Whoever rebels against your word and does not obey it, whatever you may command them, will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous!”
06002001 Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Shittim. “Go, look over the land,” he said, “especially Jericho.” So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there.
06002002 The king of Jericho was told, “Look, some of the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land.”
06002003 So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab: “Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, because they have come to spy out the whole land.”
06002004 But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. She said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they had come from.
06002005 At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, they left. I don’t know which way they went. Go after them quickly. You may catch up with them.”
06002006 (But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax she had laid out on the roof.)
06002007 So the men set out in pursuit of the spies on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.
06002008 Before the spies lay down for the night, she went up on the roof
06002009 and said to them, “I know that the Lord has given you this land and that a great fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you.
06002010 We have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan, whom you completely destroyed.
06002011 When we heard of it, our hearts melted in fear and everyone’s courage failed because of you, for the Lord your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below.
06002012 “Now then, please swear to me by the Lord that you will show kindness to my family, because I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign
06002013 that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them—and that you will save us from death.”
06002014 “Our lives for your lives!” the men assured her. “If you don’t tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the Lord gives us the land.”
06002015 So she let them down by a rope through the window, for the house she lived in was part of the city wall.
06002016 She said to them, “Go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there three days until they return, and then go on your way.”
06002017 Now the men had said to her, “This oath you made us swear will not be binding on us
06002018 unless, when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you have brought your father and mother, your brothers and all your family into your house.
06002019 If any of them go outside your house into the street, their blood will be on their own heads; we will not be responsible. As for those who are in the house with you, their blood will be on our head if a hand is laid on them.
06002020 But if you tell what we are doing, we will be released from the oath you made us swear.”
06002021 “Agreed,” she replied. “Let it be as you say.” So she sent them away, and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window.
06002022 When they left, they went into the hills and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned without finding them.
06002023 Then the two men started back. They went down out of the hills, forded the river and came to Joshua son of Nun and told him everything that had happened to them.
06002024 They said to Joshua, “The Lord has surely given the whole land into our hands; all the people are melting in fear because of us.”
06003001 Early in the morning Joshua and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and went to the Jordan, where they camped before crossing over.
06003002 After three days the officers went throughout the camp,
06003003 giving orders to the people: “When you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, and the Levitical priests carrying it, you are to move out from your positions and follow it.
06003004 Then you will know which way to go, since you have never been this way before. But keep a distance of about two thousand cubits between you and the ark; do not go near it.”
06003005 Joshua told the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do amazing things among you.”
06003006 Joshua said to the priests, “Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on ahead of the people.” So they took it up and went ahead of them.
06003007 And the Lord said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to exalt you in the eyes of all Israel, so they may know that I am with you as I was with Moses.
06003008 Tell the priests who carry the ark of the covenant: ‘When you reach the edge of the Jordan’s waters, go and stand in the river.’ ”
06003009 Joshua said to the Israelites, “Come here and listen to the words of the Lord your God.
06003010 This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that he will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites and Jebusites.
06003011 See, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go into the Jordan ahead of you.
06003012 Now then, choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.
06003013 And as soon as the priests who carry the ark of the Lord—the Lord of all the earth—set foot in the Jordan, its waters flowing downstream will be cut off and stand up in a heap.”
06003014 So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them.
06003015 Now the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest. Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water’s edge,
06003016 the water from upstream stopped flowing. It piled up in a heap a great distance away, at a town called Adam in the vicinity of Zarethan, while the water flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.
06003017 The priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord stopped in the middle of the Jordan and stood on dry ground, while all Israel passed by until the whole nation had completed the crossing on dry ground.
06004001 When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the Lord said to Joshua,
06004002 “Choose twelve men from among the people, one from each tribe,
06004003 and tell them to take up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, from right where the priests are standing, and carry them over with you and put them down at the place where you stay tonight.”
06004004 So Joshua called together the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe,
06004005 and said to them, “Go over before the ark of the Lord your God into the middle of the Jordan. Each of you is to take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites,
06004006 to serve as a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask you, ‘What do these stones mean?’
06004007 tell them that the flow of the Jordan was cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones are to be a memorial to the people of Israel forever.”
06004008 So the Israelites did as Joshua commanded them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, as the Lord had told Joshua; and they carried them over with them to their camp, where they put them down.
06004009 Joshua set up the twelve stones that had been in the middle of the Jordan at the spot where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant had stood. And they are there to this day.
06004010 Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything the Lord had commanded Joshua was done by the people, just as Moses had directed Joshua. The people hurried over,
06004011 and as soon as all of them had crossed, the ark of the Lord and the priests came to the other side while the people watched.
06004012 The men of Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over, ready for battle, in front of the Israelites, as Moses had directed them.
06004013 About forty thousand armed for battle crossed over before the Lord to the plains of Jericho for war.
06004014 That day the Lord exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they stood in awe of him all the days of his life, just as they had stood in awe of Moses.
06004015 Then the Lord said to Joshua,
06004016 “Command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant law to come up out of the Jordan.”
06004017 So Joshua commanded the priests, “Come up out of the Jordan.”
06004018 And the priests came up out of the river carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord. No sooner had they set their feet on the dry ground than the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and ran at flood stage as before.
06004019 On the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho.
06004020 And Joshua set up at Gilgal the twelve stones they had taken out of the Jordan.
06004021 He said to the Israelites, “In the future when your descendants ask their parents, ‘What do these stones mean?’
06004022 tell them, ‘Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.’
06004023 For the Lord your God dried up the Jordan before you until you had crossed over. The Lord your God did to the Jordan what he had done to the Red Sea when he dried it up before us until we had crossed over.
06004024 He did this so that all the peoples of the earth might know that the hand of the Lord is powerful and so that you might always fear the Lord your God.”
06005001 Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast heard how the Lord had dried up the Jordan before the Israelites until they had crossed over, their hearts melted in fear and they no longer had the courage to face the Israelites.
06005002 At that time the Lord said to Joshua, “Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites again.”
06005003 So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath Haaraloth.
06005004 Now this is why he did so: All those who came out of Egypt—all the men of military age—died in the wilderness on the way after leaving Egypt.
06005005 All the people that came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness during the journey from Egypt had not.
06005006 The Israelites had moved about in the wilderness forty years until all the men who were of military age when they left Egypt had died, since they had not obeyed the Lord. For the Lord had sworn to them that they would not see the land he had solemnly promised their ancestors to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
06005007 So he raised up their sons in their place, and these were the ones Joshua circumcised. They were still uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised on the way.
06005008 And after the whole nation had been circumcised, they remained where they were in camp until they were healed.
06005009 Then the Lord said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” So the place has been called Gilgal to this day.
06005010 On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, while camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, the Israelites celebrated the Passover.
06005011 The day after the Passover, that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land: unleavened bread and roasted grain.
06005012 The manna stopped the day after they ate this food from the land; there was no longer any manna for the Israelites, but that year they ate the produce of Canaan.
06005013 Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went up to him and asked, “Are you for us or for our enemies?”
06005014 “Neither,” he replied, “but as commander of the army of the Lord I have now come.” Then Joshua fell facedown to the ground in reverence, and asked him, “What message does my Lord have for his servant?”
06005015 The commander of the Lord’s army replied, “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so.
06006001 Now the gates of Jericho were securely barred because of the Israelites. No one went out and no one came in.
06006002 Then the Lord said to Joshua, “See, I have delivered Jericho into your hands, along with its king and its fighting men.
06006003 March around the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six days.
06006004 Have seven priests carry trumpets of rams’ horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing the trumpets.
06006005 When you hear them sound a long blast on the trumpets, have the whole army give a loud shout; then the wall of the city will collapse and the army will go up, everyone straight in.”
06006006 So Joshua son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant of the Lord and have seven priests carry trumpets in front of it.”
06006007 And he ordered the army, “Advance! March around the city, with an armed guard going ahead of the ark of the Lord.”
06006008 When Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets before the Lord went forward, blowing their trumpets, and the ark of the Lord’s covenant followed them.
06006009 The armed guard marched ahead of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard followed the ark. All this time the trumpets were sounding.
06006010 But Joshua had commanded the army, “Do not give a war cry, do not raise your voices, do not say a word until the day I tell you to shout. Then shout!”
06006011 So he had the ark of the Lord carried around the city, circling it once. Then the army returned to camp and spent the night there.
06006012 Joshua got up early the next morning and the priests took up the ark of the Lord.
06006013 The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets went forward, marching before the ark of the Lord and blowing the trumpets. The armed men went ahead of them and the rear guard followed the ark of the Lord, while the trumpets kept sounding.
06006014 So on the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.
06006015 On the seventh day, they got up at daybreak and marched around the city seven times in the same manner, except that on that day they circled the city seven times.
06006016 The seventh time around, when the priests sounded the trumpet blast, Joshua commanded the army, “Shout! For the Lord has given you the city!
06006017 The city and all that is in it are to be devoted to the Lord. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall be spared, because she hid the spies we sent.
06006018 But keep away from the devoted things, so that you will not bring about your own destruction by taking any of them. Otherwise you will make the camp of Israel liable to destruction and bring trouble on it.
06006019 All the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the Lord and must go into his treasury.”
06006020 When the trumpets sounded, the army shouted, and at the sound of the trumpet, when the men gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed; so everyone charged straight in, and they took the city.
06006021 They devoted the city to the Lord and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it—men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys.
06006022 Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the prostitute’s house and bring her out and all who belong to her, in accordance with your oath to her.”
06006023 So the young men who had done the spying went in and brought out Rahab, her father and mother, her brothers and sisters and all who belonged to her. They brought out her entire family and put them in a place outside the camp of Israel.
06006024 Then they burned the whole city and everything in it, but they put the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the Lord’s house.
06006025 But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her family and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent as spies to Jericho—and she lives among the Israelites to this day.
06006026 At that time Joshua pronounced this solemn oath: “Cursed before the Lord is the one who undertakes to rebuild this city, Jericho: “At the cost of his firstborn son he will lay its foundations; at the cost of his youngest he will set up its gates.”
06006027 So the Lord was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land.
06007001 But the Israelites were unfaithful in regard to the devoted things ; Achan son of Karmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of them. So the Lord’s anger burned against Israel.
06007002 Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth Aven to the east of Bethel, and told them, “Go up and spy out the region.” So the men went up and spied out Ai.
06007003 When they returned to Joshua, they said, “Not all the army will have to go up against Ai. Send two or three thousand men to take it and do not weary the whole army, for only a few people live there.”
06007004 So about three thousand went up; but they were routed by the men of Ai,
06007005 who killed about thirty-six of them. They chased the Israelites from the city gate as far as the stone quarries and struck them down on the slopes. At this the hearts of the people melted in fear and became like water.
06007006 Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown to the ground before the ark of the Lord, remaining there till evening. The elders of Israel did the same, and sprinkled dust on their heads.
06007007 And Joshua said, “Alas, Sovereign Lord, why did you ever bring this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan!
06007008 Pardon your servant, Lord. What can I say, now that Israel has been routed by its enemies?
06007009 The Canaanites and the other people of the country will hear about this and they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. What then will you do for your own great name?”
06007010 The Lord said to Joshua, “Stand up! What are you doing down on your face?
06007011 Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenant, which I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have lied, they have put them with their own possessions.
06007012 That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies; they turn their backs and run because they have been made liable to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy whatever among you is devoted to destruction.
06007013 “Go, consecrate the people. Tell them, ‘Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow; for this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: There are devoted things among you, Israel. You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove them.
06007014 “ ‘In the morning, present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe the Lord chooses shall come forward clan by clan; the clan the Lord chooses shall come forward family by family; and the family the Lord chooses shall come forward man by man.
06007015 Whoever is caught with the devoted things shall be destroyed by fire, along with all that belongs to him. He has violated the covenant of the Lord and has done an outrageous thing in Israel!’ ”
06007016 Early the next morning Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes, and Judah was chosen.
06007017 The clans of Judah came forward, and the Zerahites were chosen. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward by families, and Zimri was chosen.
06007018 Joshua had his family come forward man by man, and Achan son of Karmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was chosen.
06007019 Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and honor him. Tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me.”
06007020 Achan replied, “It is true! I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel. This is what I have done:
06007021 When I saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia, two hundred shekels of silver and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.”
06007022 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath.
06007023 They took the things from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and spread them out before the Lord.
06007024 Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the gold bar, his sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys and sheep, his tent and all that he had, to the Valley of Achor.
06007025 Joshua said, “Why have you brought this trouble on us? The Lord will bring trouble on you today.” Then all Israel stoned him, and after they had stoned the rest, they burned them.
06007026 Over Achan they heaped up a large pile of rocks, which remains to this day. Then the Lord turned from his fierce anger. Therefore that place has been called the Valley of Achor ever since.
06008001 Then the Lord said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Take the whole army with you, and go up and attack Ai. For I have delivered into your hands the king of Ai, his people, his city and his land.
06008002 You shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city.”
06008003 So Joshua and the whole army moved out to attack Ai. He chose thirty thousand of his best fighting men and sent them out at night
06008004 with these orders: “Listen carefully. You are to set an ambush behind the city. Don’t go very far from it. All of you be on the alert.
06008005 I and all those with me will advance on the city, and when the men come out against us, as they did before, we will flee from them.
06008006 They will pursue us until we have lured them away from the city, for they will say, ‘They are running away from us as they did before.’ So when we flee from them,
06008007 you are to rise up from ambush and take the city. The Lord your God will give it into your hand.
06008008 When you have taken the city, set it on fire. Do what the Lord has commanded. See to it; you have my orders.”
06008009 Then Joshua sent them off, and they went to the place of ambush and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai—but Joshua spent that night with the people.
06008010 Early the next morning Joshua mustered his army, and he and the leaders of Israel marched before them to Ai.
06008011 The entire force that was with him marched up and approached the city and arrived in front of it. They set up camp north of Ai, with the valley between them and the city.
06008012 Joshua had taken about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.
06008013 So the soldiers took up their positions—with the main camp to the north of the city and the ambush to the west of it. That night Joshua went into the valley.
06008014 When the king of Ai saw this, he and all the men of the city hurried out early in the morning to meet Israel in battle at a certain place overlooking the Arabah. But he did not know that an ambush had been set against him behind the city.
06008015 Joshua and all Israel let themselves be driven back before them, and they fled toward the wilderness.
06008016 All the men of Ai were called to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were lured away from the city.
06008017 Not a man remained in Ai or Bethel who did not go after Israel. They left the city open and went in pursuit of Israel.
06008018 Then the Lord said to Joshua, “Hold out toward Ai the javelin that is in your hand, for into your hand I will deliver the city.” So Joshua held out toward the city the javelin that was in his hand.
06008019 As soon as he did this, the men in the ambush rose quickly from their position and rushed forward. They entered the city and captured it and quickly set it on fire.
06008020 The men of Ai looked back and saw the smoke of the city rising up into the sky, but they had no chance to escape in any direction; the Israelites who had been fleeing toward the wilderness had turned back against their pursuers.
06008021 For when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that smoke was going up from it, they turned around and attacked the men of Ai.
06008022 Those in the ambush also came out of the city against them, so that they were caught in the middle, with Israelites on both sides. Israel cut them down, leaving them neither survivors nor fugitives.
06008023 But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.
06008024 When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai in the fields and in the wilderness where they had chased them, and when every one of them had been put to the sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai and killed those who were in it.
06008025 Twelve thousand men and women fell that day—all the people of Ai.
06008026 For Joshua did not draw back the hand that held out his javelin until he had destroyed all who lived in Ai.
06008027 But Israel did carry off for themselves the livestock and plunder of this city, as the Lord had instructed Joshua.
06008028 So Joshua burned Ai and made it a permanent heap of ruins, a desolate place to this day.
06008029 He impaled the body of the king of Ai on a pole and left it there until evening. At sunset, Joshua ordered them to take the body from the pole and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate. And they raised a large pile of rocks over it, which remains to this day.
06008030 Then Joshua built on Mount Ebal an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel,
06008031 as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded the Israelites. He built it according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses—an altar of uncut stones, on which no iron tool had been used. On it they offered to the Lord burnt offerings and sacrificed fellowship offerings.
06008032 There, in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua wrote on stones a copy of the law of Moses.
06008033 All the Israelites, with their elders, officials and judges, were standing on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the Lord, facing the Levitical priests who carried it. Both the foreigners living among them and the native-born were there. Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the Lord had formerly commanded when he gave instructions to bless the people of Israel.
06008034 Afterward, Joshua read all the words of the law—the blessings and the curses—just as it is written in the Book of the Law.
06008035 There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read to the whole assembly of Israel, including the women and children, and the foreigners who lived among them.
06009001 Now when all the kings west of the Jordan heard about these things—the kings in the hill country, in the western foothills, and along the entire coast of the Mediterranean Sea as far as Lebanon (the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites)—
06009002 they came together to wage war against Joshua and Israel.
06009003 However, when the people of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,
06009004 they resorted to a ruse: They went as a delegation whose donkeys were loaded with worn-out sacks and old wineskins, cracked and mended.
06009005 They put worn and patched sandals on their feet and wore old clothes. All the bread of their food supply was dry and moldy.
06009006 Then they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the Israelites, “We have come from a distant country; make a treaty with us.”
06009007 The Israelites said to the Hivites, “But perhaps you live near us, so how can we make a treaty with you?”
06009008 “We are your servants,” they said to Joshua. But Joshua asked, “Who are you and where do you come from?”
06009009 They answered: “Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the fame of the Lord your God. For we have heard reports of him: all that he did in Egypt,
06009010 and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan—Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.
06009011 And our elders and all those living in our country said to us, ‘Take provisions for your journey; go and meet them and say to them, “We are your servants; make a treaty with us.” ’
06009012 This bread of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to you. But now see how dry and moldy it is.
06009013 And these wineskins that we filled were new, but see how cracked they are. And our clothes and sandals are worn out by the very long journey.”
06009014 The Israelites sampled their provisions but did not inquire of the Lord.
06009015 Then Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live, and the leaders of the assembly ratified it by oath.
06009016 Three days after they made the treaty with the Gibeonites, the Israelites heard that they were neighbors, living near them.
06009017 So the Israelites set out and on the third day came to their cities: Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth and Kiriath Jearim.
06009018 But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the assembly had sworn an oath to them by the Lord, the God of Israel. The whole assembly grumbled against the leaders,
06009019 but all the leaders answered, “We have given them our oath by the Lord, the God of Israel, and we cannot touch them now.
06009020 This is what we will do to them: We will let them live, so that God’s wrath will not fall on us for breaking the oath we swore to them.”
06009021 They continued, “Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers in the service of the whole assembly.” So the leaders’ promise to them was kept.
06009022 Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said, “Why did you deceive us by saying, ‘We live a long way from you,’ while actually you live near us?
06009023 You are now under a curse: You will never be released from service as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.”
06009024 They answered Joshua, “Your servants were clearly told how the Lord your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you the whole land and to wipe out all its inhabitants from before you. So we feared for our lives because of you, and that is why we did this.
06009025 We are now in your hands. Do to us whatever seems good and right to you.”
06009026 So Joshua saved them from the Israelites, and they did not kill them.
06009027 That day he made the Gibeonites woodcutters and water carriers for the assembly, to provide for the needs of the altar of the Lord at the place the Lord would choose. And that is what they are to this day.
06010001 Now Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Ai and totally destroyed it, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and that the people of Gibeon had made a treaty of peace with Israel and had become their allies.
06010002 He and his people were very much alarmed at this, because Gibeon was an important city, like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were good fighters.
06010003 So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem appealed to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish and Debir king of Eglon.
06010004 “Come up and help me attack Gibeon,” he said, “because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.”
06010005 Then the five kings of the Amorites—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon—joined forces. They moved up with all their troops and took up positions against Gibeon and attacked it.
06010006 The Gibeonites then sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: “Do not abandon your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, because all the Amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us.”
06010007 So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with his entire army, including all the best fighting men.
06010008 The Lord said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them; I have given them into your hand. Not one of them will be able to withstand you.”
06010009 After an all-night march from Gilgal, Joshua took them by surprise.
06010010 The Lord threw them into confusion before Israel, so Joshua and the Israelites defeated them completely at Gibeon. Israel pursued them along the road going up to Beth Horon and cut them down all the way to Azekah and Makkedah.
06010011 As they fled before Israel on the road down from Beth Horon to Azekah, the Lord hurled large hailstones down on them, and more of them died from the hail than were killed by the swords of the Israelites.
06010012 On the day the Lord gave the Amorites over to Israel, Joshua said to the Lord in the presence of Israel: “Sun, stand still over Gibeon, and you, moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.”
06010013 So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the nation avenged itself on its enemies, as it is written in the Book of Jashar. The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day.
06010014 There has never been a day like it before or since, a day when the Lord listened to a human being. Surely the Lord was fighting for Israel!
06010015 Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.
06010016 Now the five kings had fled and hidden in the cave at Makkedah.
06010017 When Joshua was told that the five kings had been found hiding in the cave at Makkedah,
06010018 he said, “Roll large rocks up to the mouth of the cave, and post some men there to guard it.
06010019 But don’t stop; pursue your enemies! Attack them from the rear and don’t let them reach their cities, for the Lord your God has given them into your hand.”
06010020 So Joshua and the Israelites defeated them completely, but a few survivors managed to reach their fortified cities.
06010021 The whole army then returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah, and no one uttered a word against the Israelites.
06010022 Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me.”
06010023 So they brought the five kings out of the cave—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon.
06010024 When they had brought these kings to Joshua, he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the army commanders who had come with him, “Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came forward and placed their feet on their necks.
06010025 Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Be strong and courageous. This is what the Lord will do to all the enemies you are going to fight.”
06010026 Then Joshua put the kings to death and exposed their bodies on five poles, and they were left hanging on the poles until evening.
06010027 At sunset Joshua gave the order and they took them down from the poles and threw them into the cave where they had been hiding. At the mouth of the cave they placed large rocks, which are there to this day.
06010028 That day Joshua took Makkedah. He put the city and its king to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it. He left no survivors. And he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
06010029 Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked it.
06010030 The Lord also gave that city and its king into Israel’s hand. The city and everyone in it Joshua put to the sword. He left no survivors there. And he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.
06010031 Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish; he took up positions against it and attacked it.
06010032 The Lord gave Lachish into Israel’s hands, and Joshua took it on the second day. The city and everyone in it he put to the sword, just as he had done to Libnah.
06010033 Meanwhile, Horam king of Gezer had come up to help Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his army—until no survivors were left.
06010034 Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Lachish to Eglon; they took up positions against it and attacked it.
06010035 They captured it that same day and put it to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it, just as they had done to Lachish.
06010036 Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron and attacked it.
06010037 They took the city and put it to the sword, together with its king, its villages and everyone in it. They left no survivors. Just as at Eglon, they totally destroyed it and everyone in it.
06010038 Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned around and attacked Debir.
06010039 They took the city, its king and its villages, and put them to the sword. Everyone in it they totally destroyed. They left no survivors. They did to Debir and its king as they had done to Libnah and its king and to Hebron.
06010040 So Joshua subdued the whole region, including the hill country, the Negev, the western foothills and the mountain slopes, together with all their kings. He left no survivors. He totally destroyed all who breathed, just as the Lord, the God of Israel, had commanded.
06010041 Joshua subdued them from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza and from the whole region of Goshen to Gibeon.
06010042 All these kings and their lands Joshua conquered in one campaign, because the Lord, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.
06010043 Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.
06011001 When Jabin king of Hazor heard of this, he sent word to Jobab king of Madon, to the kings of Shimron and Akshaph,
06011002 and to the northern kings who were in the mountains, in the Arabah south of Kinnereth, in the western foothills and in Naphoth Dor on the west;
06011003 to the Canaanites in the east and west; to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites and Jebusites in the hill country; and to the Hivites below Hermon in the region of Mizpah.
06011004 They came out with all their troops and a large number of horses and chariots—a huge army, as numerous as the sand on the seashore.
06011005 All these kings joined forces and made camp together at the Waters of Merom to fight against Israel.
06011006 The Lord said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, because by this time tomorrow I will hand all of them, slain, over to Israel. You are to hamstring their horses and burn their chariots.”
06011007 So Joshua and his whole army came against them suddenly at the Waters of Merom and attacked them,
06011008 and the Lord gave them into the hand of Israel. They defeated them and pursued them all the way to Greater Sidon, to Misrephoth Maim, and to the Valley of Mizpah on the east, until no survivors were left.
06011009 Joshua did to them as the Lord had directed: He hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots.
06011010 At that time Joshua turned back and captured Hazor and put its king to the sword. (Hazor had been the head of all these kingdoms.)
06011011 Everyone in it they put to the sword. They totally destroyed them, not sparing anyone that breathed, and he burned Hazor itself.
06011012 Joshua took all these royal cities and their kings and put them to the sword. He totally destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded.
06011013 Yet Israel did not burn any of the cities built on their mounds—except Hazor, which Joshua burned.
06011014 The Israelites carried off for themselves all the plunder and livestock of these cities, but all the people they put to the sword until they completely destroyed them, not sparing anyone that breathed.
06011015 As the Lord commanded his servant Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua, and Joshua did it; he left nothing undone of all that the Lord commanded Moses.
06011016 So Joshua took this entire land: the hill country, all the Negev, the whole region of Goshen, the western foothills, the Arabah and the mountains of Israel with their foothills,
06011017 from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, to Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings and put them to death.
06011018 Joshua waged war against all these kings for a long time.
06011019 Except for the Hivites living in Gibeon, not one city made a treaty of peace with the Israelites, who took them all in battle.
06011020 For it was the Lord himself who hardened their hearts to wage war against Israel, so that he might destroy them totally, exterminating them without mercy, as the Lord had commanded Moses.
06011021 At that time Joshua went and destroyed the Anakites from the hill country: from Hebron, Debir and Anab, from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua totally destroyed them and their towns.
06011022 No Anakites were left in Israelite territory; only in Gaza, Gath and Ashdod did any survive.
06011023 So Joshua took the entire land, just as the Lord had directed Moses, and he gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their tribal divisions. Then the land had rest from war.
06012001 These are the kings of the land whom the Israelites had defeated and whose territory they took over east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge to Mount Hermon, including all the eastern side of the Arabah:
06012002 Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon. He ruled from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge—from the middle of the gorge—to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites. This included half of Gilead.
06012003 He also ruled over the eastern Arabah from the Sea of Galilee to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea), to Beth Jeshimoth, and then southward below the slopes of Pisgah.
06012004 And the territory of Og king of Bashan, one of the last of the Rephaites, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei.
06012005 He ruled over Mount Hermon, Salekah, all of Bashan to the border of the people of Geshur and Maakah, and half of Gilead to the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
06012006 Moses, the servant of the Lord, and the Israelites conquered them. And Moses the servant of the Lord gave their land to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh to be their possession.
06012007 Here is a list of the kings of the land that Joshua and the Israelites conquered on the west side of the Jordan, from Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir. Joshua gave their lands as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel according to their tribal divisions.
06012008 The lands included the hill country, the western foothills, the Arabah, the mountain slopes, the wilderness and the Negev. These were the lands of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. These were the kings:
06012009 the king of Jericho one the king of Ai (near Bethel) one
06012010 the king of Jerusalem one the king of Hebron one
06012011 the king of Jarmuth one the king of Lachish one
06012012 the king of Eglon one the king of Gezer one
06012013 the king of Debir one the king of Geder one
06012014 the king of Hormah one the king of Arad one
06012015 the king of Libnah one the king of Adullam one
06012016 the king of Makkedah one the king of Bethel one
06012017 the king of Tappuah one the king of Hepher one
06012018 the king of Aphek one the king of Lasharon one
06012019 the king of Madon one the king of Hazor one
06012020 the king of Shimron Meron one the king of Akshaph one
06012021 the king of Taanach one the king of Megiddo one
06012022 the king of Kedesh one the king of Jokneam in Carmel one
06012023 the king of Dor (in Naphoth Dor) one the king of Goyim in Gilgal one
06012024 the king of Tirzah one
06013001 When Joshua had grown old, the Lord said to him, “You are now very old, and there are still very large areas of land to be taken over.
06013002 “This is the land that remains: all the regions of the Philistines and Geshurites,
06013003 from the Shihor River on the east of Egypt to the territory of Ekron on the north, all of it counted as Canaanite though held by the five Philistine rulers in Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron; the territory of the Avvites
06013004 on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, from Arah of the Sidonians as far as Aphek and the border of the Amorites;
06013005 the area of Byblos; and all Lebanon to the east, from Baal Gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo Hamath.
06013006 “As for all the inhabitants of the mountain regions from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, that is, all the Sidonians, I myself will drive them out before the Israelites. Be sure to allocate this land to Israel for an inheritance, as I have instructed you,
06013007 and divide it as an inheritance among the nine tribes and half of the tribe of Manasseh.”
06013008 The other half of Manasseh, the Reubenites and the Gadites had received the inheritance that Moses had given them east of the Jordan, as he, the servant of the Lord, had assigned it to them.
06013009 It extended from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the middle of the gorge, and included the whole plateau of Medeba as far as Dibon,
06013010 and all the towns of Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, out to the border of the Ammonites.
06013011 It also included Gilead, the territory of the people of Geshur and Maakah, all of Mount Hermon and all Bashan as far as Salekah—
06013012 that is, the whole kingdom of Og in Bashan, who had reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei. (He was the last of the Rephaites.) Moses had defeated them and taken over their land.
06013013 But the Israelites did not drive out the people of Geshur and Maakah, so they continue to live among the Israelites to this day.
06013014 But to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance, since the food offerings presented to the Lord, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, as he promised them.
06013015 This is what Moses had given to the tribe of Reuben, according to its clans:
06013016 The territory from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the middle of the gorge, and the whole plateau past Medeba
06013017 to Heshbon and all its towns on the plateau, including Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon,
06013018 Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,
06013019 Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar on the hill in the valley,
06013020 Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth—
06013021 all the towns on the plateau and the entire realm of Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled at Heshbon. Moses had defeated him and the Midianite chiefs, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba—princes allied with Sihon—who lived in that country.
06013022 In addition to those slain in battle, the Israelites had put to the sword Balaam son of Beor, who practiced divination.
06013023 The boundary of the Reubenites was the bank of the Jordan. These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the Reubenites, according to their clans.
06013024 This is what Moses had given to the tribe of Gad, according to its clans:
06013025 The territory of Jazer, all the towns of Gilead and half the Ammonite country as far as Aroer, near Rabbah;
06013026 and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpah and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the territory of Debir;
06013027 and in the valley, Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Sukkoth and Zaphon with the rest of the realm of Sihon king of Heshbon (the east side of the Jordan, the territory up to the end of the Sea of Galilee ).
06013028 These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the Gadites, according to their clans.
06013029 This is what Moses had given to the half-tribe of Manasseh, that is, to half the family of the descendants of Manasseh, according to its clans:
06013030 The territory extending from Mahanaim and including all of Bashan, the entire realm of Og king of Bashan—all the settlements of Jair in Bashan, sixty towns,
06013031 half of Gilead, and Ashtaroth and Edrei (the royal cities of Og in Bashan). This was for the descendants of Makir son of Manasseh—for half of the sons of Makir, according to their clans.
06013032 This is the inheritance Moses had given when he was in the plains of Moab across the Jordan east of Jericho.
06013033 But to the tribe of Levi, Moses had given no inheritance; the Lord, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as he promised them.
06014001 Now these are the areas the Israelites received as an inheritance in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the tribal clans of Israel allotted to them.
06014002 Their inheritances were assigned by lot to the nine-and-a-half tribes, as the Lord had commanded through Moses.
06014003 Moses had granted the two-and-a-half tribes their inheritance east of the Jordan but had not granted the Levites an inheritance among the rest,
06014004 for Joseph’s descendants had become two tribes—Manasseh and Ephraim. The Levites received no share of the land but only towns to live in, with pasturelands for their flocks and herds.
06014005 So the Israelites divided the land, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
06014006 Now the people of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know what the Lord said to Moses the man of God at Kadesh Barnea about you and me.
06014007 I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh Barnea to explore the land. And I brought him back a report according to my convictions,
06014008 but my fellow Israelites who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt in fear. I, however, followed the Lord my God wholeheartedly.
06014009 So on that day Moses swore to me, ‘The land on which your feet have walked will be your inheritance and that of your children forever, because you have followed the Lord my God wholeheartedly.’
06014010 “Now then, just as the Lord promised, he has kept me alive for forty-five years since the time he said this to Moses, while Israel moved about in the wilderness. So here I am today, eighty-five years old!
06014011 I am still as strong today as the day Moses sent me out; I’m just as vigorous to go out to battle now as I was then.
06014012 Now give me this hill country that the Lord promised me that day. You yourself heard then that the Anakites were there and their cities were large and fortified, but, the Lord helping me, I will drive them out just as he said.”
06014013 Then Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his inheritance.
06014014 So Hebron has belonged to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite ever since, because he followed the Lord, the God of Israel, wholeheartedly.
06014015 (Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba after Arba, who was the greatest man among the Anakites.) Then the land had rest from war.
06015001 The allotment for the tribe of Judah, according to its clans, extended down to the territory of Edom, to the Desert of Zin in the extreme south.
06015002 Their southern boundary started from the bay at the southern end of the Dead Sea,
06015003 crossed south of Scorpion Pass, continued on to Zin and went over to the south of Kadesh Barnea. Then it ran past Hezron up to Addar and curved around to Karka.
06015004 It then passed along to Azmon and joined the Wadi of Egypt, ending at the Mediterranean Sea. This is their southern boundary.
06015005 The eastern boundary is the Dead Sea as far as the mouth of the Jordan. The northern boundary started from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan,
06015006 went up to Beth Hoglah and continued north of Beth Arabah to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.
06015007 The boundary then went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor and turned north to Gilgal, which faces the Pass of Adummim south of the gorge. It continued along to the waters of En Shemesh and came out at En Rogel.
06015008 Then it ran up the Valley of Ben Hinnom along the southern slope of the Jebusite city (that is, Jerusalem). From there it climbed to the top of the hill west of the Hinnom Valley at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim.
06015009 From the hilltop the boundary headed toward the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, came out at the towns of Mount Ephron and went down toward Baalah (that is, Kiriath Jearim).
06015010 Then it curved westward from Baalah to Mount Seir, ran along the northern slope of Mount Jearim (that is, Kesalon), continued down to Beth Shemesh and crossed to Timnah.
06015011 It went to the northern slope of Ekron, turned toward Shikkeron, passed along to Mount Baalah and reached Jabneel. The boundary ended at the sea.
06015012 The western boundary is the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea. These are the boundaries around the people of Judah by their clans.
06015013 In accordance with the Lord’s command to him, Joshua gave to Caleb son of Jephunneh a portion in Judah—Kiriath Arba, that is, Hebron. (Arba was the forefather of Anak.)
06015014 From Hebron Caleb drove out the three Anakites—Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai, the sons of Anak.
06015015 From there he marched against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher).
06015016 And Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Aksah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher.”
06015017 Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s brother, took it; so Caleb gave his daughter Aksah to him in marriage.
06015018 One day when she came to Othniel, she urged him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What can I do for you?”
06015019 She replied, “Do me a special favor. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
06015020 This is the inheritance of the tribe of Judah, according to its clans:
06015021 The southernmost towns of the tribe of Judah in the Negev toward the boundary of Edom were: Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur,
06015022 Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,
06015023 Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan,
06015024 Ziph, Telem, Bealoth,
06015025 Hazor Hadattah, Kerioth Hezron (that is, Hazor),
06015026 Amam, Shema, Moladah,
06015027 Hazar Gaddah, Heshmon, Beth Pelet,
06015028 Hazar Shual, Beersheba, Biziothiah,
06015029 Baalah, Iyim, Ezem,
06015030 Eltolad, Kesil, Hormah,
06015031 Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah,
06015032 Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain and Rimmon—a total of twenty-nine towns and their villages.
06015033 In the western foothills: Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah,
06015034 Zanoah, En Gannim, Tappuah, Enam,
06015035 Jarmuth, Adullam, Sokoh, Azekah,
06015036 Shaaraim, Adithaim and Gederah (or Gederothaim) —fourteen towns and their villages.
06015037 Zenan, Hadashah, Migdal Gad,
06015038 Dilean, Mizpah, Joktheel,
06015039 Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon,
06015040 Kabbon, Lahmas, Kitlish,
06015041 Gederoth, Beth Dagon, Naamah and Makkedah—sixteen towns and their villages.
06015042 Libnah, Ether, Ashan,
06015043 Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib,
06015044 Keilah, Akzib and Mareshah—nine towns and their villages.
06015045 Ekron, with its surrounding settlements and villages;
06015046 west of Ekron, all that were in the vicinity of Ashdod, together with their villages;
06015047 Ashdod, its surrounding settlements and villages; and Gaza, its settlements and villages, as far as the Wadi of Egypt and the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea.
06015048 In the hill country: Shamir, Jattir, Sokoh,
06015049 Dannah, Kiriath Sannah (that is, Debir),
06015050 Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim,
06015051 Goshen, Holon and Giloh—eleven towns and their villages.
06015052 Arab, Dumah, Eshan,
06015053 Janim, Beth Tappuah, Aphekah,
06015054 Humtah, Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) and Zior—nine towns and their villages.
06015055 Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah,
06015056 Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah,
06015057 Kain, Gibeah and Timnah—ten towns and their villages.
06015058 Halhul, Beth Zur, Gedor,
06015059 Maarath, Beth Anoth and Eltekon—six towns and their villages.
06015060 Kiriath Baal (that is, Kiriath Jearim) and Rabbah—two towns and their villages.
06015061 In the wilderness: Beth Arabah, Middin, Sekakah,
06015062 Nibshan, the City of Salt and En Gedi—six towns and their villages.
06015063 Judah could not dislodge the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem; to this day the Jebusites live there with the people of Judah.
06016001 The allotment for Joseph began at the Jordan, east of the springs of Jericho, and went up from there through the desert into the hill country of Bethel.
06016002 It went on from Bethel (that is, Luz), crossed over to the territory of the Arkites in Ataroth,
06016003 descended westward to the territory of the Japhletites as far as the region of Lower Beth Horon and on to Gezer, ending at the Mediterranean Sea.
06016004 So Manasseh and Ephraim, the descendants of Joseph, received their inheritance.
06016005 This was the territory of Ephraim, according to its clans: The boundary of their inheritance went from Ataroth Addar in the east to Upper Beth Horon
06016006 and continued to the Mediterranean Sea. From Mikmethath on the north it curved eastward to Taanath Shiloh, passing by it to Janoah on the east.
06016007 Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and Naarah, touched Jericho and came out at the Jordan.
06016008 From Tappuah the border went west to the Kanah Ravine and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the Ephraimites, according to its clans.
06016009 It also included all the towns and their villages that were set aside for the Ephraimites within the inheritance of the Manassites.
06016010 They did not dislodge the Canaanites living in Gezer; to this day the Canaanites live among the people of Ephraim but are required to do forced labor.
06017001 This was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh as Joseph’s firstborn, that is, for Makir, Manasseh’s firstborn. Makir was the ancestor of the Gileadites, who had received Gilead and Bashan because the Makirites were great soldiers.
06017002 So this allotment was for the rest of the people of Manasseh—the clans of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher and Shemida. These are the other male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph by their clans.
06017003 Now Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons but only daughters, whose names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milkah and Tirzah.
06017004 They went to Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders and said, “The Lord commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our relatives.” So Joshua gave them an inheritance along with the brothers of their father, according to the Lord’s command.
06017005 Manasseh’s share consisted of ten tracts of land besides Gilead and Bashan east of the Jordan,
06017006 because the daughters of the tribe of Manasseh received an inheritance among the sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the descendants of Manasseh.
06017007 The territory of Manasseh extended from Asher to Mikmethath east of Shechem. The boundary ran southward from there to include the people living at En Tappuah.
06017008 (Manasseh had the land of Tappuah, but Tappuah itself, on the boundary of Manasseh, belonged to the Ephraimites.)
06017009 Then the boundary continued south to the Kanah Ravine. There were towns belonging to Ephraim lying among the towns of Manasseh, but the boundary of Manasseh was the northern side of the ravine and ended at the Mediterranean Sea.
06017010 On the south the land belonged to Ephraim, on the north to Manasseh. The territory of Manasseh reached the Mediterranean Sea and bordered Asher on the north and Issachar on the east.
06017011 Within Issachar and Asher, Manasseh also had Beth Shan, Ibleam and the people of Dor, Endor, Taanach and Megiddo, together with their surrounding settlements (the third in the list is Naphoth ).
06017012 Yet the Manassites were not able to occupy these towns, for the Canaanites were determined to live in that region.
06017013 However, when the Israelites grew stronger, they subjected the Canaanites to forced labor but did not drive them out completely.
06017014 The people of Joseph said to Joshua, “Why have you given us only one allotment and one portion for an inheritance? We are a numerous people, and the Lord has blessed us abundantly.”
06017015 “If you are so numerous,” Joshua answered, “and if the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you, go up into the forest and clear land for yourselves there in the land of the Perizzites and Rephaites.”
06017016 The people of Joseph replied, “The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites who live in the plain have chariots fitted with iron, both those in Beth Shan and its settlements and those in the Valley of Jezreel.”
06017017 But Joshua said to the tribes of Joseph—to Ephraim and Manasseh—“You are numerous and very powerful. You will have not only one allotment
06017018 but the forested hill country as well. Clear it, and its farthest limits will be yours; though the Canaanites have chariots fitted with iron and though they are strong, you can drive them out.”
06018001 The whole assembly of the Israelites gathered at Shiloh and set up the tent of meeting there. The country was brought under their control,
06018002 but there were still seven Israelite tribes who had not yet received their inheritance.
06018003 So Joshua said to the Israelites: “How long will you wait before you begin to take possession of the land that the Lord, the God of your ancestors, has given you?
06018004 Appoint three men from each tribe. I will send them out to make a survey of the land and to write a description of it, according to the inheritance of each. Then they will return to me.
06018005 You are to divide the land into seven parts. Judah is to remain in its territory on the south and the tribes of Joseph in their territory on the north.
06018006 After you have written descriptions of the seven parts of the land, bring them here to me and I will cast lots for you in the presence of the Lord our God.
06018007 The Levites, however, do not get a portion among you, because the priestly service of the Lord is their inheritance. And Gad, Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan. Moses the servant of the Lord gave it to them.”
06018008 As the men started on their way to map out the land, Joshua instructed them, “Go and make a survey of the land and write a description of it. Then return to me, and I will cast lots for you here at Shiloh in the presence of the Lord.”
06018009 So the men left and went through the land. They wrote its description on a scroll, town by town, in seven parts, and returned to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh.
06018010 Joshua then cast lots for them in Shiloh in the presence of the Lord, and there he distributed the land to the Israelites according to their tribal divisions.
06018011 The first lot came up for the tribe of Benjamin according to its clans. Their allotted territory lay between the tribes of Judah and Joseph:
06018012 On the north side their boundary began at the Jordan, passed the northern slope of Jericho and headed west into the hill country, coming out at the wilderness of Beth Aven.
06018013 From there it crossed to the south slope of Luz (that is, Bethel) and went down to Ataroth Addar on the hill south of Lower Beth Horon.
06018014 From the hill facing Beth Horon on the south the boundary turned south along the western side and came out at Kiriath Baal (that is, Kiriath Jearim), a town of the people of Judah. This was the western side.
06018015 The southern side began at the outskirts of Kiriath Jearim on the west, and the boundary came out at the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.
06018016 The boundary went down to the foot of the hill facing the Valley of Ben Hinnom, north of the Valley of Rephaim. It continued down the Hinnom Valley along the southern slope of the Jebusite city and so to En Rogel.
06018017 It then curved north, went to En Shemesh, continued to Geliloth, which faces the Pass of Adummim, and ran down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.
06018018 It continued to the northern slope of Beth Arabah and on down into the Arabah.
06018019 It then went to the northern slope of Beth Hoglah and came out at the northern bay of the Dead Sea, at the mouth of the Jordan in the south. This was the southern boundary.
06018020 The Jordan formed the boundary on the eastern side. These were the boundaries that marked out the inheritance of the clans of Benjamin on all sides.
06018021 The tribe of Benjamin, according to its clans, had the following towns: Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz,
06018022 Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,
06018023 Avvim, Parah, Ophrah,
06018024 Kephar Ammoni, Ophni and Geba—twelve towns and their villages.
06018025 Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth,
06018026 Mizpah, Kephirah, Mozah,
06018027 Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,
06018028 Zelah, Haeleph, the Jebusite city (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah and Kiriath—fourteen towns and their villages. This was the inheritance of Benjamin for its clans.
06019001 The second lot came out for the tribe of Simeon according to its clans. Their inheritance lay within the territory of Judah.
06019002 It included: Beersheba (or Sheba), Moladah,
06019003 Hazar Shual, Balah, Ezem,
06019004 Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah,
06019005 Ziklag, Beth Markaboth, Hazar Susah,
06019006 Beth Lebaoth and Sharuhen—thirteen towns and their villages;
06019007 Ain, Rimmon, Ether and Ashan—four towns and their villages—
06019008 and all the villages around these towns as far as Baalath Beer (Ramah in the Negev). This was the inheritance of the tribe of the Simeonites, according to its clans.
06019009 The inheritance of the Simeonites was taken from the share of Judah, because Judah’s portion was more than they needed. So the Simeonites received their inheritance within the territory of Judah.
06019010 The third lot came up for Zebulun according to its clans: The boundary of their inheritance went as far as Sarid.
06019011 Going west it ran to Maralah, touched Dabbesheth, and extended to the ravine near Jokneam.
06019012 It turned east from Sarid toward the sunrise to the territory of Kisloth Tabor and went on to Daberath and up to Japhia.
06019013 Then it continued eastward to Gath Hepher and Eth Kazin; it came out at Rimmon and turned toward Neah.
06019014 There the boundary went around on the north to Hannathon and ended at the Valley of Iphtah El.
06019015 Included were Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah and Bethlehem. There were twelve towns and their villages.
06019016 These towns and their villages were the inheritance of Zebulun, according to its clans.
06019017 The fourth lot came out for Issachar according to its clans.
06019018 Their territory included: Jezreel, Kesulloth, Shunem,
06019019 Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath,
06019020 Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez,
06019021 Remeth, En Gannim, En Haddah and Beth Pazzez.
06019022 The boundary touched Tabor, Shahazumah and Beth Shemesh, and ended at the Jordan. There were sixteen towns and their villages.
06019023 These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the tribe of Issachar, according to its clans.
06019024 The fifth lot came out for the tribe of Asher according to its clans.
06019025 Their territory included: Helkath, Hali, Beten, Akshaph,
06019026 Allammelek, Amad and Mishal. On the west the boundary touched Carmel and Shihor Libnath.
06019027 It then turned east toward Beth Dagon, touched Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtah El, and went north to Beth Emek and Neiel, passing Kabul on the left.
06019028 It went to Abdon, Rehob, Hammon and Kanah, as far as Greater Sidon.
06019029 The boundary then turned back toward Ramah and went to the fortified city of Tyre, turned toward Hosah and came out at the Mediterranean Sea in the region of Akzib,
06019030 Ummah, Aphek and Rehob. There were twenty-two towns and their villages.
06019031 These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the tribe of Asher, according to its clans.
06019032 The sixth lot came out for Naphtali according to its clans:
06019033 Their boundary went from Heleph and the large tree in Zaanannim, passing Adami Nekeb and Jabneel to Lakkum and ending at the Jordan.
06019034 The boundary ran west through Aznoth Tabor and came out at Hukkok. It touched Zebulun on the south, Asher on the west and the Jordan on the east.
06019035 The fortified towns were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Kinnereth,
06019036 Adamah, Ramah, Hazor,
06019037 Kedesh, Edrei, En Hazor,
06019038 Iron, Migdal El, Horem, Beth Anath and Beth Shemesh. There were nineteen towns and their villages.
06019039 These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the tribe of Naphtali, according to its clans.
06019040 The seventh lot came out for the tribe of Dan according to its clans.
06019041 The territory of their inheritance included: Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir Shemesh,
06019042 Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah,
06019043 Elon, Timnah, Ekron,
06019044 Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath,
06019045 Jehud, Bene Berak, Gath Rimmon,
06019046 Me Jarkon and Rakkon, with the area facing Joppa.
06019047 (When the territory of the Danites was lost to them, they went up and attacked Leshem, took it, put it to the sword and occupied it. They settled in Leshem and named it Dan after their ancestor.)
06019048 These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the tribe of Dan, according to its clans.
06019049 When they had finished dividing the land into its allotted portions, the Israelites gave Joshua son of Nun an inheritance among them,
06019050 as the Lord had commanded. They gave him the town he asked for—Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim. And he built up the town and settled there.
06019051 These are the territories that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the tribal clans of Israel assigned by lot at Shiloh in the presence of the Lord at the entrance to the tent of meeting. And so they finished dividing the land.
06020001 Then the Lord said to Joshua:
06020002 “Tell the Israelites to designate the cities of refuge, as I instructed you through Moses,
06020003 so that anyone who kills a person accidentally and unintentionally may flee there and find protection from the avenger of blood.
06020004 When they flee to one of these cities, they are to stand in the entrance of the city gate and state their case before the elders of that city. Then the elders are to admit the fugitive into their city and provide a place to live among them.
06020005 If the avenger of blood comes in pursuit, the elders must not surrender the fugitive, because the fugitive killed their neighbor unintentionally and without malice aforethought.
06020006 They are to stay in that city until they have stood trial before the assembly and until the death of the high priest who is serving at that time. Then they may go back to their own home in the town from which they fled.”
06020007 So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.
06020008 East of the Jordan (on the other side from Jericho) they designated Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau in the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead in the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan in the tribe of Manasseh.
06020009 Any of the Israelites or any foreigner residing among them who killed someone accidentally could flee to these designated cities and not be killed by the avenger of blood prior to standing trial before the assembly.
06021001 Now the family heads of the Levites approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the other tribal families of Israel
06021002 at Shiloh in Canaan and said to them, “The Lord commanded through Moses that you give us towns to live in, with pasturelands for our livestock.”
06021003 So, as the Lord had commanded, the Israelites gave the Levites the following towns and pasturelands out of their own inheritance:
06021004 The first lot came out for the Kohathites, according to their clans. The Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest were allotted thirteen towns from the tribes of Judah, Simeon and Benjamin.
06021005 The rest of Kohath’s descendants were allotted ten towns from the clans of the tribes of Ephraim, Dan and half of Manasseh.
06021006 The descendants of Gershon were allotted thirteen towns from the clans of the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali and the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
06021007 The descendants of Merari, according to their clans, received twelve towns from the tribes of Reuben, Gad and Zebulun.
06021008 So the Israelites allotted to the Levites these towns and their pasturelands, as the Lord had commanded through Moses.
06021009 From the tribes of Judah and Simeon they allotted the following towns by name
06021010 (these towns were assigned to the descendants of Aaron who were from the Kohathite clans of the Levites, because the first lot fell to them):
06021011 They gave them Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), with its surrounding pastureland, in the hill country of Judah. (Arba was the forefather of Anak.)
06021012 But the fields and villages around the city they had given to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession.
06021013 So to the descendants of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron (a city of refuge for one accused of murder), Libnah,
06021014 Jattir, Eshtemoa,
06021015 Holon, Debir,
06021016 Ain, Juttah and Beth Shemesh, together with their pasturelands—nine towns from these two tribes.
06021017 And from the tribe of Benjamin they gave them Gibeon, Geba,
06021018 Anathoth and Almon, together with their pasturelands—four towns.
06021019 The total number of towns for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, came to thirteen, together with their pasturelands.
06021020 The rest of the Kohathite clans of the Levites were allotted towns from the tribe of Ephraim:
06021021 In the hill country of Ephraim they were given Shechem (a city of refuge for one accused of murder) and Gezer,
06021022 Kibzaim and Beth Horon, together with their pasturelands—four towns.
06021023 Also from the tribe of Dan they received Eltekeh, Gibbethon,
06021024 Aijalon and Gath Rimmon, together with their pasturelands—four towns.
06021025 From half the tribe of Manasseh they received Taanach and Gath Rimmon, together with their pasturelands—two towns.
06021026 All these ten towns and their pasturelands were given to the rest of the Kohathite clans.
06021027 The Levite clans of the Gershonites were given: from the half-tribe of Manasseh, Golan in Bashan (a city of refuge for one accused of murder) and Be Eshterah, together with their pasturelands—two towns;
06021028 from the tribe of Issachar, Kishion, Daberath,
06021029 Jarmuth and En Gannim, together with their pasturelands—four towns;
06021030 from the tribe of Asher, Mishal, Abdon,
06021031 Helkath and Rehob, together with their pasturelands—four towns;
06021032 from the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee (a city of refuge for one accused of murder), Hammoth Dor and Kartan, together with their pasturelands—three towns.
06021033 The total number of towns of the Gershonite clans came to thirteen, together with their pasturelands.
06021034 The Merarite clans (the rest of the Levites) were given: from the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam, Kartah,
06021035 Dimnah and Nahalal, together with their pasturelands—four towns;
06021036 from the tribe of Reuben, Bezer, Jahaz,
06021037 Kedemoth and Mephaath, together with their pasturelands—four towns;
06021038 from the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead (a city of refuge for one accused of murder), Mahanaim,
06021039 Heshbon and Jazer, together with their pasturelands—four towns in all.
06021040 The total number of towns allotted to the Merarite clans, who were the rest of the Levites, came to twelve.
06021041 The towns of the Levites in the territory held by the Israelites were forty-eight in all, together with their pasturelands.
06021042 Each of these towns had pasturelands surrounding it; this was true for all these towns.
06021043 So the Lord gave Israel all the land he had sworn to give their ancestors, and they took possession of it and settled there.
06021044 The Lord gave them rest on every side, just as he had sworn to their ancestors. Not one of their enemies withstood them; the Lord gave all their enemies into their hands.
06021045 Not one of all the Lord’s good promises to Israel failed; every one was fulfilled.
06022001 Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh
06022002 and said to them, “You have done all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded, and you have obeyed me in everything I commanded.
06022003 For a long time now—to this very day—you have not deserted your fellow Israelites but have carried out the mission the Lord your God gave you.
06022004 Now that the Lord your God has given them rest as he promised, return to your homes in the land that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you on the other side of the Jordan.
06022005 But be very careful to keep the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you: to love the Lord your God, to walk in obedience to him, to keep his commands, to hold fast to him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.”
06022006 Then Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their homes.
06022007 (To the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given land in Bashan, and to the other half of the tribe Joshua gave land on the west side of the Jordan along with their fellow Israelites.) When Joshua sent them home, he blessed them,
06022008 saying, “Return to your homes with your great wealth—with large herds of livestock, with silver, gold, bronze and iron, and a great quantity of clothing—and divide the plunder from your enemies with your fellow Israelites.”
06022009 So the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh left the Israelites at Shiloh in Canaan to return to Gilead, their own land, which they had acquired in accordance with the command of the Lord through Moses.
06022010 When they came to Geliloth near the Jordan in the land of Canaan, the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an imposing altar there by the Jordan.
06022011 And when the Israelites heard that they had built the altar on the border of Canaan at Geliloth near the Jordan on the Israelite side,
06022012 the whole assembly of Israel gathered at Shiloh to go to war against them.
06022013 So the Israelites sent Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, to the land of Gilead—to Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
06022014 With him they sent ten of the chief men, one from each of the tribes of Israel, each the head of a family division among the Israelite clans.
06022015 When they went to Gilead—to Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh—they said to them:
06022016 “The whole assembly of the Lord says: ‘How could you break faith with the God of Israel like this? How could you turn away from the Lord and build yourselves an altar in rebellion against him now?
06022017 Was not the sin of Peor enough for us? Up to this very day we have not cleansed ourselves from that sin, even though a plague fell on the community of the Lord!
06022018 And are you now turning away from the Lord? “ ‘If you rebel against the Lord today, tomorrow he will be angry with the whole community of Israel.
06022019 If the land you possess is defiled, come over to the Lord’s land, where the Lord’s tabernacle stands, and share the land with us. But do not rebel against the Lord or against us by building an altar for yourselves, other than the altar of the Lord our God.
06022020 When Achan son of Zerah was unfaithful in regard to the devoted things, did not wrath come on the whole community of Israel? He was not the only one who died for his sin.’ ”
06022021 Then Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh replied to the heads of the clans of Israel:
06022022 “The Mighty One, God, the Lord! The Mighty One, God, the Lord! He knows! And let Israel know! If this has been in rebellion or disobedience to the Lord, do not spare us this day.
06022023 If we have built our own altar to turn away from the Lord and to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, or to sacrifice fellowship offerings on it, may the Lord himself call us to account.
06022024 “No! We did it for fear that some day your descendants might say to ours, ‘What do you have to do with the Lord, the God of Israel?
06022025 The Lord has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you—you Reubenites and Gadites! You have no share in the Lord.’ So your descendants might cause ours to stop fearing the Lord.
06022026 “That is why we said, ‘Let us get ready and build an altar—but not for burnt offerings or sacrifices.’
06022027 On the contrary, it is to be a witness between us and you and the generations that follow, that we will worship the Lord at his sanctuary with our burnt offerings, sacrifices and fellowship offerings. Then in the future your descendants will not be able to say to ours, ‘You have no share in the Lord.’
06022028 “And we said, ‘If they ever say this to us, or to our descendants, we will answer: Look at the replica of the Lord’s altar, which our ancestors built, not for burnt offerings and sacrifices, but as a witness between us and you.’
06022029 “Far be it from us to rebel against the Lord and turn away from him today by building an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings and sacrifices, other than the altar of the Lord our God that stands before his tabernacle.”
06022030 When Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the community—the heads of the clans of the Israelites—heard what Reuben, Gad and Manasseh had to say, they were pleased.
06022031 And Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, said to Reuben, Gad and Manasseh, “Today we know that the Lord is with us, because you have not been unfaithful to the Lord in this matter. Now you have rescued the Israelites from the Lord’s hand.”
06022032 Then Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, and the leaders returned to Canaan from their meeting with the Reubenites and Gadites in Gilead and reported to the Israelites.
06022033 They were glad to hear the report and praised God. And they talked no more about going to war against them to devastate the country where the Reubenites and the Gadites lived.
06022034 And the Reubenites and the Gadites gave the altar this name: A Witness Between Us—that the Lord is God.
06023001 After a long time had passed and the Lord had given Israel rest from all their enemies around them, Joshua, by then a very old man,
06023002 summoned all Israel—their elders, leaders, judges and officials—and said to them: “I am very old.
06023003 You yourselves have seen everything the Lord your God has done to all these nations for your sake; it was the Lord your God who fought for you.
06023004 Remember how I have allotted as an inheritance for your tribes all the land of the nations that remain—the nations I conquered—between the Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea in the west.
06023005 The Lord your God himself will push them out for your sake. He will drive them out before you, and you will take possession of their land, as the Lord your God promised you.
06023006 “Be very strong; be careful to obey all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, without turning aside to the right or to the left.
06023007 Do not associate with these nations that remain among you; do not invoke the names of their gods or swear by them. You must not serve them or bow down to them.
06023008 But you are to hold fast to the Lord your God, as you have until now.
06023009 “The Lord has driven out before you great and powerful nations; to this day no one has been able to withstand you.
06023010 One of you routs a thousand, because the Lord your God fights for you, just as he promised.
06023011 So be very careful to love the Lord your God.
06023012 “But if you turn away and ally yourselves with the survivors of these nations that remain among you and if you intermarry with them and associate with them,
06023013 then you may be sure that the Lord your God will no longer drive out these nations before you. Instead, they will become snares and traps for you, whips on your backs and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land, which the Lord your God has given you.
06023014 “Now I am about to go the way of all the earth. You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the Lord your God gave you has failed. Every promise has been fulfilled; not one has failed.
06023015 But just as all the good things the Lord your God has promised you have come to you, so he will bring on you all the evil things he has threatened, until the Lord your God has destroyed you from this good land he has given you.
06023016 If you violate the covenant of the Lord your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, the Lord’s anger will burn against you, and you will quickly perish from the good land he has given you.”
06024001 Then Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Shechem. He summoned the elders, leaders, judges and officials of Israel, and they presented themselves before God.
06024002 Joshua said to all the people, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘Long ago your ancestors, including Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived beyond the Euphrates River and worshiped other gods.
06024003 But I took your father Abraham from the land beyond the Euphrates and led him throughout Canaan and gave him many descendants. I gave him Isaac,
06024004 and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I assigned the hill country of Seir to Esau, but Jacob and his family went down to Egypt.
06024005 “ ‘Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I afflicted the Egyptians by what I did there, and I brought you out.
06024006 When I brought your people out of Egypt, you came to the sea, and the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and horsemen as far as the Red Sea.
06024007 But they cried to the Lord for help, and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians; he brought the sea over them and covered them. You saw with your own eyes what I did to the Egyptians. Then you lived in the wilderness for a long time.
06024008 “ ‘I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived east of the Jordan. They fought against you, but I gave them into your hands. I destroyed them from before you, and you took possession of their land.
06024009 When Balak son of Zippor, the king of Moab, prepared to fight against Israel, he sent for Balaam son of Beor to put a curse on you.
06024010 But I would not listen to Balaam, so he blessed you again and again, and I delivered you out of his hand.
06024011 “ ‘Then you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The citizens of Jericho fought against you, as did also the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites and Jebusites, but I gave them into your hands.
06024012 I sent the hornet ahead of you, which drove them out before you—also the two Amorite kings. You did not do it with your own sword and bow.
06024013 So I gave you a land on which you did not toil and cities you did not build; and you live in them and eat from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.’
06024014 “Now fear the Lord and serve him with all faithfulness. Throw away the gods your ancestors worshiped beyond the Euphrates River and in Egypt, and serve the Lord.
06024015 But if serving the Lord seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living. But as for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.”
06024016 Then the people answered, “Far be it from us to forsake the Lord to serve other gods!
06024017 It was the Lord our God himself who brought us and our parents up out of Egypt, from that land of slavery, and performed those great signs before our eyes. He protected us on our entire journey and among all the nations through which we traveled.
06024018 And the Lord drove out before us all the nations, including the Amorites, who lived in the land. We too will serve the Lord, because he is our God.”
06024019 Joshua said to the people, “You are not able to serve the Lord. He is a holy God; he is a jealous God. He will not forgive your rebellion and your sins.
06024020 If you forsake the Lord and serve foreign gods, he will turn and bring disaster on you and make an end of you, after he has been good to you.”
06024021 But the people said to Joshua, “No! We will serve the Lord.”
06024022 Then Joshua said, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the Lord.” “Yes, we are witnesses,” they replied.
06024023 “Now then,” said Joshua, “throw away the foreign gods that are among you and yield your hearts to the Lord, the God of Israel.”
06024024 And the people said to Joshua, “We will serve the Lord our God and obey him.”
06024025 On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people, and there at Shechem he reaffirmed for them decrees and laws.
06024026 And Joshua recorded these things in the Book of the Law of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak near the holy place of the Lord.
06024027 “See!” he said to all the people. “This stone will be a witness against us. It has heard all the words the Lord has said to us. It will be a witness against you if you are untrue to your God.”
06024028 Then Joshua dismissed the people, each to their own inheritance.
06024029 After these things, Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of a hundred and ten.
06024030 And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
06024031 Israel served the Lord throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had experienced everything the Lord had done for Israel.
06024032 And Joseph’s bones, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the tract of land that Jacob bought for a hundred pieces of silver from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem. This became the inheritance of Joseph’s descendants.
06024033 And Eleazar son of Aaron died and was buried at Gibeah, which had been allotted to his son Phinehas in the hill country of Ephraim.
07001001 After the death of Joshua, the Israelites asked the Lord, “Who of us is to go up first to fight against the Canaanites?”
07001002 The Lord answered, “Judah shall go up; I have given the land into their hands.”
07001003 The men of Judah then said to the Simeonites their fellow Israelites, “Come up with us into the territory allotted to us, to fight against the Canaanites. We in turn will go with you into yours.” So the Simeonites went with them.
07001004 When Judah attacked, the Lord gave the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands, and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek.
07001005 It was there that they found Adoni-Bezek and fought against him, putting to rout the Canaanites and Perizzites.
07001006 Adoni-Bezek fled, but they chased him and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
07001007 Then Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have picked up scraps under my table. Now God has paid me back for what I did to them.” They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
07001008 The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem also and took it. They put the city to the sword and set it on fire.
07001009 After that, Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev and the western foothills.
07001010 They advanced against the Canaanites living in Hebron (formerly called Kiriath Arba) and defeated Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai.
07001011 From there they advanced against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher).
07001012 And Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Aksah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher.”
07001013 Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it; so Caleb gave his daughter Aksah to him in marriage.
07001014 One day when she came to Othniel, she urged him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What can I do for you?”
07001015 She replied, “Do me a special favor. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
07001016 The descendants of Moses’ father-in-law, the Kenite, went up from the City of Palms with the people of Judah to live among the inhabitants of the Desert of Judah in the Negev near Arad.
07001017 Then the men of Judah went with the Simeonites their fellow Israelites and attacked the Canaanites living in Zephath, and they totally destroyed the city. Therefore it was called Hormah.
07001018 Judah also took Gaza, Ashkelon and Ekron—each city with its territory.
07001019 The Lord was with the men of Judah. They took possession of the hill country, but they were unable to drive the people from the plains, because they had chariots fitted with iron.
07001020 As Moses had promised, Hebron was given to Caleb, who drove from it the three sons of Anak.
07001021 The Benjamites, however, did not drive out the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem; to this day the Jebusites live there with the Benjamites.
07001022 Now the tribes of Joseph attacked Bethel, and the Lord was with them.
07001023 When they sent men to spy out Bethel (formerly called Luz),
07001024 the spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him, “Show us how to get into the city and we will see that you are treated well.”
07001025 So he showed them, and they put the city to the sword but spared the man and his whole family.
07001026 He then went to the land of the Hittites, where he built a city and called it Luz, which is its name to this day.
07001027 But Manasseh did not drive out the people of Beth Shan or Taanach or Dor or Ibleam or Megiddo and their surrounding settlements, for the Canaanites were determined to live in that land.
07001028 When Israel became strong, they pressed the Canaanites into forced labor but never drove them out completely.
07001029 Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, but the Canaanites continued to live there among them.
07001030 Neither did Zebulun drive out the Canaanites living in Kitron or Nahalol, so these Canaanites lived among them, but Zebulun did subject them to forced labor.
07001031 Nor did Asher drive out those living in Akko or Sidon or Ahlab or Akzib or Helbah or Aphek or Rehob.
07001032 The Asherites lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land because they did not drive them out.
07001033 Neither did Naphtali drive out those living in Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath; but the Naphtalites too lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, and those living in Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath became forced laborers for them.
07001034 The Amorites confined the Danites to the hill country, not allowing them to come down into the plain.
07001035 And the Amorites were determined also to hold out in Mount Heres, Aijalon and Shaalbim, but when the power of the tribes of Joseph increased, they too were pressed into forced labor.
07001036 The boundary of the Amorites was from Scorpion Pass to Sela and beyond.
07002001 The angel of the Lord went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said, “I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land I swore to give to your ancestors. I said, ‘I will never break my covenant with you,
07002002 and you shall not make a covenant with the people of this land, but you shall break down their altars.’ Yet you have disobeyed me. Why have you done this?
07002003 And I have also said, ‘I will not drive them out before you; they will become traps for you, and their gods will become snares to you.’ ”
07002004 When the angel of the Lord had spoken these things to all the Israelites, the people wept aloud,
07002005 and they called that place Bokim. There they offered sacrifices to the Lord.
07002006 After Joshua had dismissed the Israelites, they went to take possession of the land, each to their own inheritance.
07002007 The people served the Lord throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had seen all the great things the Lord had done for Israel.
07002008 Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of a hundred and ten.
07002009 And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Heres in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
07002010 After that whole generation had been gathered to their ancestors, another generation grew up who knew neither the Lord nor what he had done for Israel.
07002011 Then the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord and served the Baals.
07002012 They forsook the Lord, the God of their ancestors, who had brought them out of Egypt. They followed and worshiped various gods of the peoples around them. They aroused the Lord’s anger
07002013 because they forsook him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.
07002014 In his anger against Israel the Lord gave them into the hands of raiders who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, whom they were no longer able to resist.
07002015 Whenever Israel went out to fight, the hand of the Lord was against them to defeat them, just as he had sworn to them. They were in great distress.
07002016 Then the Lord raised up judges, who saved them out of the hands of these raiders.
07002017 Yet they would not listen to their judges but prostituted themselves to other gods and worshiped them. They quickly turned from the ways of their ancestors, who had been obedient to the Lord’s commands.
07002018 Whenever the Lord raised up a judge for them, he was with the judge and saved them out of the hands of their enemies as long as the judge lived; for the Lord relented because of their groaning under those who oppressed and afflicted them.
07002019 But when the judge died, the people returned to ways even more corrupt than those of their ancestors, following other gods and serving and worshiping them. They refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways.
07002020 Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel and said, “Because this nation has violated the covenant I ordained for their ancestors and has not listened to me,
07002021 I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left when he died.
07002022 I will use them to test Israel and see whether they will keep the way of the Lord and walk in it as their ancestors did.”
07002023 The Lord had allowed those nations to remain; he did not drive them out at once by giving them into the hands of Joshua.
07003001 These are the nations the Lord left to test all those Israelites who had not experienced any of the wars in Canaan
07003002 (he did this only to teach warfare to the descendants of the Israelites who had not had previous battle experience):
07003003 the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living in the Lebanon mountains from Mount Baal Hermon to Lebo Hamath.
07003004 They were left to test the Israelites to see whether they would obey the Lord’s commands, which he had given their ancestors through Moses.
07003005 The Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
07003006 They took their daughters in marriage and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
07003007 The Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord; they forgot the Lord their God and served the Baals and the Asherahs.
07003008 The anger of the Lord burned against Israel so that he sold them into the hands of Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram Naharaim, to whom the Israelites were subject for eight years.
07003009 But when they cried out to the Lord, he raised up for them a deliverer, Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, who saved them.
07003010 The Spirit of the Lord came on him, so that he became Israel’s judge and went to war. The Lord gave Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram into the hands of Othniel, who overpowered him.
07003011 So the land had peace for forty years, until Othniel son of Kenaz died.
07003012 Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord, and because they did this evil the Lord gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel.
07003013 Getting the Ammonites and Amalekites to join him, Eglon came and attacked Israel, and they took possession of the City of Palms.
07003014 The Israelites were subject to Eglon king of Moab for eighteen years.
07003015 Again the Israelites cried out to the Lord, and he gave them a deliverer—Ehud, a left-handed man, the son of Gera the Benjamite. The Israelites sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab.
07003016 Now Ehud had made a double-edged sword about a cubit long, which he strapped to his right thigh under his clothing.
07003017 He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab, who was a very fat man.
07003018 After Ehud had presented the tribute, he sent on their way those who had carried it.
07003019 But on reaching the stone images near Gilgal he himself went back to Eglon and said, “Your Majesty, I have a secret message for you.” The king said to his attendants, “Leave us!” And they all left.
07003020 Ehud then approached him while he was sitting alone in the upper room of his palace and said, “I have a message from God for you.” As the king rose from his seat,
07003021 Ehud reached with his left hand, drew the sword from his right thigh and plunged it into the king’s belly.
07003022 Even the handle sank in after the blade, and his bowels discharged. Ehud did not pull the sword out, and the fat closed in over it.
07003023 Then Ehud went out to the porch ; he shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them.
07003024 After he had gone, the servants came and found the doors of the upper room locked. They said, “He must be relieving himself in the inner room of the palace.”
07003025 They waited to the point of embarrassment, but when he did not open the doors of the room, they took a key and unlocked them. There they saw their lord fallen to the floor, dead.
07003026 While they waited, Ehud got away. He passed by the stone images and escaped to Seirah.
07003027 When he arrived there, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went down with him from the hills, with him leading them.
07003028 “Follow me,” he ordered, “for the Lord has given Moab, your enemy, into your hands.” So they followed him down and took possession of the fords of the Jordan that led to Moab; they allowed no one to cross over.
07003029 At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all vigorous and strong; not one escaped.
07003030 That day Moab was made subject to Israel, and the land had peace for eighty years.
07003031 After Ehud came Shamgar son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad. He too saved Israel.
07004001 Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord, now that Ehud was dead.
07004002 So the Lord sold them into the hands of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. Sisera, the commander of his army, was based in Harosheth Haggoyim.
07004003 Because he had nine hundred chariots fitted with iron and had cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years, they cried to the Lord for help.
07004004 Now Deborah, a prophet, the wife of Lappidoth, was leading Israel at that time.
07004005 She held court under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went up to her to have their disputes decided.
07004006 She sent for Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, “The Lord, the God of Israel, commands you: ‘Go, take with you ten thousand men of Naphtali and Zebulun and lead them up to Mount Tabor.
07004007 I will lead Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his troops to the Kishon River and give him into your hands.’ ”
07004008 Barak said to her, “If you go with me, I will go; but if you don’t go with me, I won’t go.”
07004009 “Certainly I will go with you,” said Deborah. “But because of the course you are taking, the honor will not be yours, for the Lord will deliver Sisera into the hands of a woman.” So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh.
07004010 There Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali, and ten thousand men went up under his command. Deborah also went up with him.
07004011 Now Heber the Kenite had left the other Kenites, the descendants of Hobab, Moses’ brother-in-law, and pitched his tent by the great tree in Zaanannim near Kedesh.
07004012 When they told Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,
07004013 Sisera summoned from Harosheth Haggoyim to the Kishon River all his men and his nine hundred chariots fitted with iron.
07004014 Then Deborah said to Barak, “Go! This is the day the Lord has given Sisera into your hands. Has not the Lord gone ahead of you?” So Barak went down Mount Tabor, with ten thousand men following him.
07004015 At Barak’s advance, the Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by the sword, and Sisera got down from his chariot and fled on foot.
07004016 Barak pursued the chariots and army as far as Harosheth Haggoyim, and all Sisera’s troops fell by the sword; not a man was left.
07004017 Sisera, meanwhile, fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was an alliance between Jabin king of Hazor and the family of Heber the Kenite.
07004018 Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Come, my lord, come right in. Don’t be afraid.” So he entered her tent, and she covered him with a blanket.
07004019 “I’m thirsty,” he said. “Please give me some water.” She opened a skin of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him up.
07004020 “Stand in the doorway of the tent,” he told her. “If someone comes by and asks you, ‘Is anyone in there?’ say ‘No.’ ”
07004021 But Jael, Heber’s wife, picked up a tent peg and a hammer and went quietly to him while he lay fast asleep, exhausted. She drove the peg through his temple into the ground, and he died.
07004022 Just then Barak came by in pursuit of Sisera, and Jael went out to meet him. “Come,” she said, “I will show you the man you’re looking for.” So he went in with her, and there lay Sisera with the tent peg through his temple—dead.
07004023 On that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan before the Israelites.
07004024 And the hand of the Israelites pressed harder and harder against Jabin king of Canaan until they destroyed him.
07005001 On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song:
07005002 “When the princes in Israel take the lead, when the people willingly offer themselves— praise the Lord!
07005003 “Hear this, you kings! Listen, you rulers! I, even I, will sing to the Lord; I will praise the Lord, the God of Israel, in song.
07005004 “When you, Lord, went out from Seir, when you marched from the land of Edom, the earth shook, the heavens poured, the clouds poured down water.
07005005 The mountains quaked before the Lord, the One of Sinai, before the Lord, the God of Israel.
07005006 “In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were abandoned; travelers took to winding paths.
07005007 Villagers in Israel would not fight; they held back until I, Deborah, arose, until I arose, a mother in Israel.
07005008 God chose new leaders when war came to the city gates, but not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in Israel.
07005009 My heart is with Israel’s princes, with the willing volunteers among the people. Praise the Lord!
07005010 “You who ride on white donkeys, sitting on your saddle blankets, and you who walk along the road, consider
07005011 the voice of the singers at the watering places. They recite the victories of the Lord, the victories of his villagers in Israel. “Then the people of the Lord went down to the city gates.
07005012 ‘Wake up, wake up, Deborah! Wake up, wake up, break out in song! Arise, Barak! Take captive your captives, son of Abinoam.’
07005013 “The remnant of the nobles came down; the people of the Lord came down to me against the mighty.
07005014 Some came from Ephraim, whose roots were in Amalek; Benjamin was with the people who followed you. From Makir captains came down, from Zebulun those who bear a commander’s staff.
07005015 The princes of Issachar were with Deborah; yes, Issachar was with Barak, sent under his command into the valley. In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart.
07005016 Why did you stay among the sheep pens to hear the whistling for the flocks? In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart.
07005017 Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan. And Dan, why did he linger by the ships? Asher remained on the coast and stayed in his coves.
07005018 The people of Zebulun risked their very lives; so did Naphtali on the terraced fields.
07005019 “Kings came, they fought, the kings of Canaan fought. At Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo, they took no plunder of silver.
07005020 From the heavens the stars fought, from their courses they fought against Sisera.
07005021 The river Kishon swept them away, the age-old river, the river Kishon. March on, my soul; be strong!
07005022 Then thundered the horses’ hooves— galloping, galloping go his mighty steeds.
07005023 ‘Curse Meroz,’ said the angel of the Lord. ‘Curse its people bitterly, because they did not come to help the Lord, to help the Lord against the mighty.’
07005024 “Most blessed of women be Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, most blessed of tent-dwelling women.
07005025 He asked for water, and she gave him milk; in a bowl fit for nobles she brought him curdled milk.
07005026 Her hand reached for the tent peg, her right hand for the workman’s hammer. She struck Sisera, she crushed his head, she shattered and pierced his temple.
07005027 At her feet he sank, he fell; there he lay. At her feet he sank, he fell; where he sank, there he fell—dead.
07005028 “Through the window peered Sisera’s mother; behind the lattice she cried out, ‘Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why is the clatter of his chariots delayed?’
07005029 The wisest of her ladies answer her; indeed, she keeps saying to herself,
07005030 ‘Are they not finding and dividing the spoils: a woman or two for each man, colorful garments as plunder for Sisera, colorful garments embroidered, highly embroidered garments for my neck— all this as plunder?’
07005031 “So may all your enemies perish, Lord! But may all who love you be like the sun when it rises in its strength.” Then the land had peace forty years.
07006001 The Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord, and for seven years he gave them into the hands of the Midianites.
07006002 Because the power of Midian was so oppressive, the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves in mountain clefts, caves and strongholds.
07006003 Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples invaded the country.
07006004 They camped on the land and ruined the crops all the way to Gaza and did not spare a living thing for Israel, neither sheep nor cattle nor donkeys.
07006005 They came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts. It was impossible to count them or their camels; they invaded the land to ravage it.
07006006 Midian so impoverished the Israelites that they cried out to the Lord for help.
07006007 When the Israelites cried out to the Lord because of Midian,
07006008 he sent them a prophet, who said, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I brought you up out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
07006009 I rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians. And I delivered you from the hand of all your oppressors; I drove them out before you and gave you their land.
07006010 I said to you, ‘I am the Lord your God; do not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live.’ But you have not listened to me.”
07006011 The angel of the Lord came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites.
07006012 When the angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon, he said, “The Lord is with you, mighty warrior.”
07006013 “Pardon me, my lord,” Gideon replied, “but if the Lord is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our ancestors told us about when they said, ‘Did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt?’ But now the Lord has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian.”
07006014 The Lord turned to him and said, “Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian’s hand. Am I not sending you?”
07006015 “Pardon me, my lord,” Gideon replied, “but how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.”
07006016 The Lord answered, “I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites, leaving none alive.”
07006017 Gideon replied, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, give me a sign that it is really you talking to me.
07006018 Please do not go away until I come back and bring my offering and set it before you.” And the Lord said, “I will wait until you return.”
07006019 Gideon went inside, prepared a young goat, and from an ephah of flour he made bread without yeast. Putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot, he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak.
07006020 The angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth.” And Gideon did so.
07006021 Then the angel of the Lord touched the meat and the unleavened bread with the tip of the staff that was in his hand. Fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. And the angel of the Lord disappeared.
07006022 When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the Lord, he exclaimed, “Alas, Sovereign Lord! I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face!”
07006023 But the Lord said to him, “Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die.”
07006024 So Gideon built an altar to the Lord there and called it The Lord Is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
07006025 That same night the Lord said to him, “Take the second bull from your father’s herd, the one seven years old. Tear down your father’s altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.
07006026 Then build a proper kind of altar to the Lord your God on the top of this height. Using the wood of the Asherah pole that you cut down, offer the second bull as a burnt offering.”
07006027 So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the Lord told him. But because he was afraid of his family and the townspeople, he did it at night rather than in the daytime.
07006028 In the morning when the people of the town got up, there was Baal’s altar, demolished, with the Asherah pole beside it cut down and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar!
07006029 They asked each other, “Who did this?” When they carefully investigated, they were told, “Gideon son of Joash did it.”
07006030 The people of the town demanded of Joash, “Bring out your son. He must die, because he has broken down Baal’s altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.”
07006031 But Joash replied to the hostile crowd around him, “Are you going to plead Baal’s cause? Are you trying to save him? Whoever fights for him shall be put to death by morning! If Baal really is a god, he can defend himself when someone breaks down his altar.”
07006032 So because Gideon broke down Baal’s altar, they gave him the name Jerub-Baal that day, saying, “Let Baal contend with him.”
07006033 Now all the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples joined forces and crossed over the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel.
07006034 Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him.
07006035 He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, calling them to arms, and also into Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, so that they too went up to meet them.
07006036 Gideon said to God, “If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised—
07006037 look, I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you said.”
07006038 And that is what happened. Gideon rose early the next day; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew—a bowlful of water.
07006039 Then Gideon said to God, “Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request. Allow me one more test with the fleece, but this time make the fleece dry and let the ground be covered with dew.”
07006040 That night God did so. Only the fleece was dry; all the ground was covered with dew.
07007001 Early in the morning, Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) and all his men camped at the spring of Harod. The camp of Midian was north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh.
07007002 The Lord said to Gideon, “You have too many men. I cannot deliver Midian into their hands, or Israel would boast against me, ‘My own strength has saved me.’
07007003 Now announce to the army, ‘Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.’ ” So twenty-two thousand men left, while ten thousand remained.
07007004 But the Lord said to Gideon, “There are still too many men. Take them down to the water, and I will thin them out for you there. If I say, ‘This one shall go with you,’ he shall go; but if I say, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ he shall not go.”
07007005 So Gideon took the men down to the water. There the Lord told him, “Separate those who lap the water with their tongues as a dog laps from those who kneel down to drink.”
07007006 Three hundred of them drank from cupped hands, lapping like dogs. All the rest got down on their knees to drink.
07007007 The Lord said to Gideon, “With the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hands. Let all the others go home.”
07007008 So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites home but kept the three hundred, who took over the provisions and trumpets of the others. Now the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley.
07007009 During that night the Lord said to Gideon, “Get up, go down against the camp, because I am going to give it into your hands.
07007010 If you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah
07007011 and listen to what they are saying. Afterward, you will be encouraged to attack the camp.” So he and Purah his servant went down to the outposts of the camp.
07007012 The Midianites, the Amalekites and all the other eastern peoples had settled in the valley, thick as locusts. Their camels could no more be counted than the sand on the seashore.
07007013 Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. “I had a dream,” he was saying. “A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed.”
07007014 His friend responded, “This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands.”
07007015 When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he bowed down and worshiped. He returned to the camp of Israel and called out, “Get up! The Lord has given the Midianite camp into your hands.”
07007016 Dividing the three hundred men into three companies, he placed trumpets and empty jars in the hands of all of them, with torches inside.
07007017 “Watch me,” he told them. “Follow my lead. When I get to the edge of the camp, do exactly as I do.
07007018 When I and all who are with me blow our trumpets, then from all around the camp blow yours and shout, ‘For the Lord and for Gideon.’ ”
07007019 Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after they had changed the guard. They blew their trumpets and broke the jars that were in their hands.
07007020 The three companies blew the trumpets and smashed the jars. Grasping the torches in their left hands and holding in their right hands the trumpets they were to blow, they shouted, “A sword for the Lord and for Gideon!”
07007021 While each man held his position around the camp, all the Midianites ran, crying out as they fled.
07007022 When the three hundred trumpets sounded, the Lord caused the men throughout the camp to turn on each other with their swords. The army fled to Beth Shittah toward Zererah as far as the border of Abel Meholah near Tabbath.
07007023 Israelites from Naphtali, Asher and all Manasseh were called out, and they pursued the Midianites.
07007024 Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters of the Jordan ahead of them as far as Beth Barah.” So all the men of Ephraim were called out and they seized the waters of the Jordan as far as Beth Barah.
07007025 They also captured two of the Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was by the Jordan.
07008001 Now the Ephraimites asked Gideon, “Why have you treated us like this? Why didn’t you call us when you went to fight Midian?” And they challenged him vigorously.
07008002 But he answered them, “What have I accomplished compared to you? Aren’t the gleanings of Ephraim’s grapes better than the full grape harvest of Abiezer?
07008003 God gave Oreb and Zeeb, the Midianite leaders, into your hands. What was I able to do compared to you?” At this, their resentment against him subsided.
07008004 Gideon and his three hundred men, exhausted yet keeping up the pursuit, came to the Jordan and crossed it.
07008005 He said to the men of Sukkoth, “Give my troops some bread; they are worn out, and I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”
07008006 But the officials of Sukkoth said, “Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your troops?”
07008007 Then Gideon replied, “Just for that, when the Lord has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will tear your flesh with desert thorns and briers.”
07008008 From there he went up to Peniel and made the same request of them, but they answered as the men of Sukkoth had.
07008009 So he said to the men of Peniel, “When I return in triumph, I will tear down this tower.”
07008010 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with a force of about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of the armies of the eastern peoples; a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had fallen.
07008011 Gideon went up by the route of the nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked the unsuspecting army.
07008012 Zebah and Zalmunna, the two kings of Midian, fled, but he pursued them and captured them, routing their entire army.
07008013 Gideon son of Joash then returned from the battle by the Pass of Heres.
07008014 He caught a young man of Sukkoth and questioned him, and the young man wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven officials of Sukkoth, the elders of the town.
07008015 Then Gideon came and said to the men of Sukkoth, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me by saying, ‘Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your exhausted men?’ ”
07008016 He took the elders of the town and taught the men of Sukkoth a lesson by punishing them with desert thorns and briers.
07008017 He also pulled down the tower of Peniel and killed the men of the town.
07008018 Then he asked Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?” “Men like you,” they answered, “each one with the bearing of a prince.”
07008019 Gideon replied, “Those were my brothers, the sons of my own mother. As surely as the Lord lives, if you had spared their lives, I would not kill you.”
07008020 Turning to Jether, his oldest son, he said, “Kill them!” But Jether did not draw his sword, because he was only a boy and was afraid.
07008021 Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Come, do it yourself. ‘As is the man, so is his strength.’ ” So Gideon stepped forward and killed them, and took the ornaments off their camels’ necks.
07008022 The Israelites said to Gideon, “Rule over us—you, your son and your grandson—because you have saved us from the hand of Midian.”
07008023 But Gideon told them, “I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The Lord will rule over you.”
07008024 And he said, “I do have one request, that each of you give me an earring from your share of the plunder.” (It was the custom of the Ishmaelites to wear gold earrings.)
07008025 They answered, “We’ll be glad to give them.” So they spread out a garment, and each of them threw a ring from his plunder onto it.
07008026 The weight of the gold rings he asked for came to seventeen hundred shekels, not counting the ornaments, the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian or the chains that were on their camels’ necks.
07008027 Gideon made the gold into an ephod, which he placed in Ophrah, his town. All Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family.
07008028 Thus Midian was subdued before the Israelites and did not raise its head again. During Gideon’s lifetime, the land had peace forty years.
07008029 Jerub-Baal son of Joash went back home to live.
07008030 He had seventy sons of his own, for he had many wives.
07008031 His concubine, who lived in Shechem, also bore him a son, whom he named Abimelek.
07008032 Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
07008033 No sooner had Gideon died than the Israelites again prostituted themselves to the Baals. They set up Baal-Berith as their god
07008034 and did not remember the Lord their God, who had rescued them from the hands of all their enemies on every side.
07008035 They also failed to show any loyalty to the family of Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) in spite of all the good things he had done for them.
07009001 Abimelek son of Jerub-Baal went to his mother’s brothers in Shechem and said to them and to all his mother’s clan,
07009002 “Ask all the citizens of Shechem, ‘Which is better for you: to have all seventy of Jerub-Baal’s sons rule over you, or just one man?’ Remember, I am your flesh and blood.”
07009003 When the brothers repeated all this to the citizens of Shechem, they were inclined to follow Abimelek, for they said, “He is related to us.”
07009004 They gave him seventy shekels of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith, and Abimelek used it to hire reckless scoundrels, who became his followers.
07009005 He went to his father’s home in Ophrah and on one stone murdered his seventy brothers, the sons of Jerub-Baal. But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerub-Baal, escaped by hiding.
07009006 Then all the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo gathered beside the great tree at the pillar in Shechem to crown Abimelek king.
07009007 When Jotham was told about this, he climbed up on the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted to them, “Listen to me, citizens of Shechem, so that God may listen to you.
07009008 One day the trees went out to anoint a king for themselves. They said to the olive tree, ‘Be our king.’
07009009 “But the olive tree answered, ‘Should I give up my oil, by which both gods and humans are honored, to hold sway over the trees?’
07009010 “Next, the trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come and be our king.’
07009011 “But the fig tree replied, ‘Should I give up my fruit, so good and sweet, to hold sway over the trees?’
07009012 “Then the trees said to the vine, ‘Come and be our king.’
07009013 “But the vine answered, ‘Should I give up my wine, which cheers both gods and humans, to hold sway over the trees?’
07009014 “Finally all the trees said to the thornbush, ‘Come and be our king.’
07009015 “The thornbush said to the trees, ‘If you really want to anoint me king over you, come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, then let fire come out of the thornbush and consume the cedars of Lebanon!’
07009016 “Have you acted honorably and in good faith by making Abimelek king? Have you been fair to Jerub-Baal and his family? Have you treated him as he deserves?
07009017 Remember that my father fought for you and risked his life to rescue you from the hand of Midian.
07009018 But today you have revolted against my father’s family. You have murdered his seventy sons on a single stone and have made Abimelek, the son of his female slave, king over the citizens of Shechem because he is related to you.
07009019 So have you acted honorably and in good faith toward Jerub-Baal and his family today? If you have, may Abimelek be your joy, and may you be his, too!
07009020 But if you have not, let fire come out from Abimelek and consume you, the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo, and let fire come out from you, the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo, and consume Abimelek!”
07009021 Then Jotham fled, escaping to Beer, and he lived there because he was afraid of his brother Abimelek.
07009022 After Abimelek had governed Israel three years,
07009023 God stirred up animosity between Abimelek and the citizens of Shechem so that they acted treacherously against Abimelek.
07009024 God did this in order that the crime against Jerub-Baal’s seventy sons, the shedding of their blood, might be avenged on their brother Abimelek and on the citizens of Shechem, who had helped him murder his brothers.
07009025 In opposition to him these citizens of Shechem set men on the hilltops to ambush and rob everyone who passed by, and this was reported to Abimelek.
07009026 Now Gaal son of Ebed moved with his clan into Shechem, and its citizens put their confidence in him.
07009027 After they had gone out into the fields and gathered the grapes and trodden them, they held a festival in the temple of their god. While they were eating and drinking, they cursed Abimelek.
07009028 Then Gaal son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelek, and why should we Shechemites be subject to him? Isn’t he Jerub-Baal’s son, and isn’t Zebul his deputy? Serve the family of Hamor, Shechem’s father! Why should we serve Abimelek?
07009029 If only this people were under my command! Then I would get rid of him. I would say to Abimelek, ‘Call out your whole army!’ ”
07009030 When Zebul the governor of the city heard what Gaal son of Ebed said, he was very angry.
07009031 Under cover he sent messengers to Abimelek, saying, “Gaal son of Ebed and his clan have come to Shechem and are stirring up the city against you.
07009032 Now then, during the night you and your men should come and lie in wait in the fields.
07009033 In the morning at sunrise, advance against the city. When Gaal and his men come out against you, seize the opportunity to attack them.”
07009034 So Abimelek and all his troops set out by night and took up concealed positions near Shechem in four companies.
07009035 Now Gaal son of Ebed had gone out and was standing at the entrance of the city gate just as Abimelek and his troops came out from their hiding place.
07009036 When Gaal saw them, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains!” Zebul replied, “You mistake the shadows of the mountains for men.”
07009037 But Gaal spoke up again: “Look, people are coming down from the central hill, and a company is coming from the direction of the diviners’ tree.”
07009038 Then Zebul said to him, “Where is your big talk now, you who said, ‘Who is Abimelek that we should be subject to him?’ Aren’t these the men you ridiculed? Go out and fight them!”
07009039 So Gaal led out the citizens of Shechem and fought Abimelek.
07009040 Abimelek chased him all the way to the entrance of the gate, and many were killed as they fled.
07009041 Then Abimelek stayed in Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his clan out of Shechem.
07009042 The next day the people of Shechem went out to the fields, and this was reported to Abimelek.
07009043 So he took his men, divided them into three companies and set an ambush in the fields. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he rose to attack them.
07009044 Abimelek and the companies with him rushed forward to a position at the entrance of the city gate. Then two companies attacked those in the fields and struck them down.
07009045 All that day Abimelek pressed his attack against the city until he had captured it and killed its people. Then he destroyed the city and scattered salt over it.
07009046 On hearing this, the citizens in the tower of Shechem went into the stronghold of the temple of El-Berith.
07009047 When Abimelek heard that they had assembled there,
07009048 he and all his men went up Mount Zalmon. He took an ax and cut off some branches, which he lifted to his shoulders. He ordered the men with him, “Quick! Do what you have seen me do!”
07009049 So all the men cut branches and followed Abimelek. They piled them against the stronghold and set it on fire with the people still inside. So all the people in the tower of Shechem, about a thousand men and women, also died.
07009050 Next Abimelek went to Thebez and besieged it and captured it.
07009051 Inside the city, however, was a strong tower, to which all the men and women—all the people of the city—had fled. They had locked themselves in and climbed up on the tower roof.
07009052 Abimelek went to the tower and attacked it. But as he approached the entrance to the tower to set it on fire,
07009053 a woman dropped an upper millstone on his head and cracked his skull.
07009054 Hurriedly he called to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and kill me, so that they can’t say, ‘A woman killed him.’ ” So his servant ran him through, and he died.
07009055 When the Israelites saw that Abimelek was dead, they went home.
07009056 Thus God repaid the wickedness that Abimelek had done to his father by murdering his seventy brothers.
07009057 God also made the people of Shechem pay for all their wickedness. The curse of Jotham son of Jerub-Baal came on them.
07010001 After the time of Abimelek, a man of Issachar named Tola son of Puah, the son of Dodo, rose to save Israel. He lived in Shamir, in the hill country of Ephraim.
07010002 He led Israel twenty-three years; then he died, and was buried in Shamir.
07010003 He was followed by Jair of Gilead, who led Israel twenty-two years.
07010004 He had thirty sons, who rode thirty donkeys. They controlled thirty towns in Gilead, which to this day are called Havvoth Jair.
07010005 When Jair died, he was buried in Kamon.
07010006 Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord. They served the Baals and the Ashtoreths, and the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites and the gods of the Philistines. And because the Israelites forsook the Lord and no longer served him,
07010007 he became angry with them. He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and the Ammonites,
07010008 who that year shattered and crushed them. For eighteen years they oppressed all the Israelites on the east side of the Jordan in Gilead, the land of the Amorites.
07010009 The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin and Ephraim; Israel was in great distress.
07010010 Then the Israelites cried out to the Lord, “We have sinned against you, forsaking our God and serving the Baals.”
07010011 The Lord replied, “When the Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites, the Philistines,
07010012 the Sidonians, the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you and you cried to me for help, did I not save you from their hands?
07010013 But you have forsaken me and served other gods, so I will no longer save you.
07010014 Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen. Let them save you when you are in trouble!”
07010015 But the Israelites said to the Lord, “We have sinned. Do with us whatever you think best, but please rescue us now.”
07010016 Then they got rid of the foreign gods among them and served the Lord. And he could bear Israel’s misery no longer.
07010017 When the Ammonites were called to arms and camped in Gilead, the Israelites assembled and camped at Mizpah.
07010018 The leaders of the people of Gilead said to each other, “Whoever will take the lead in attacking the Ammonites will be head over all who live in Gilead.”
07011001 Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior. His father was Gilead; his mother was a prostitute.
07011002 Gilead’s wife also bore him sons, and when they were grown up, they drove Jephthah away. “You are not going to get any inheritance in our family,” they said, “because you are the son of another woman.”
07011003 So Jephthah fled from his brothers and settled in the land of Tob, where a gang of scoundrels gathered around him and followed him.
07011004 Some time later, when the Ammonites were fighting against Israel,
07011005 the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob.
07011006 “Come,” they said, “be our commander, so we can fight the Ammonites.”
07011007 Jephthah said to them, “Didn’t you hate me and drive me from my father’s house? Why do you come to me now, when you’re in trouble?”
07011008 The elders of Gilead said to him, “Nevertheless, we are turning to you now; come with us to fight the Ammonites, and you will be head over all of us who live in Gilead.”
07011009 Jephthah answered, “Suppose you take me back to fight the Ammonites and the Lord gives them to me—will I really be your head?”
07011010 The elders of Gilead replied, “The Lord is our witness; we will certainly do as you say.”
07011011 So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and commander over them. And he repeated all his words before the Lord in Mizpah.
07011012 Then Jephthah sent messengers to the Ammonite king with the question: “What do you have against me that you have attacked my country?”
07011013 The king of the Ammonites answered Jephthah’s messengers, “When Israel came up out of Egypt, they took away my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, all the way to the Jordan. Now give it back peaceably.”
07011014 Jephthah sent back messengers to the Ammonite king,
07011015 saying: “This is what Jephthah says: Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites.
07011016 But when they came up out of Egypt, Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea and on to Kadesh.
07011017 Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Give us permission to go through your country,’ but the king of Edom would not listen. They sent also to the king of Moab, and he refused. So Israel stayed at Kadesh.
07011018 “Next they traveled through the wilderness, skirted the lands of Edom and Moab, passed along the eastern side of the country of Moab, and camped on the other side of the Arnon. They did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was its border.
07011019 “Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, and said to him, ‘Let us pass through your country to our own place.’
07011020 Sihon, however, did not trust Israel to pass through his territory. He mustered all his troops and encamped at Jahaz and fought with Israel.
07011021 “Then the Lord, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and his whole army into Israel’s hands, and they defeated them. Israel took over all the land of the Amorites who lived in that country,
07011022 capturing all of it from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the desert to the Jordan.
07011023 “Now since the Lord, the God of Israel, has driven the Amorites out before his people Israel, what right have you to take it over?
07011024 Will you not take what your god Chemosh gives you? Likewise, whatever the Lord our God has given us, we will possess.
07011025 Are you any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever quarrel with Israel or fight with them?
07011026 For three hundred years Israel occupied Heshbon, Aroer, the surrounding settlements and all the towns along the Arnon. Why didn’t you retake them during that time?
07011027 I have not wronged you, but you are doing me wrong by waging war against me. Let the Lord, the Judge, decide the dispute this day between the Israelites and the Ammonites.”
07011028 The king of Ammon, however, paid no attention to the message Jephthah sent him.
07011029 Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Jephthah. He crossed Gilead and Manasseh, passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and from there he advanced against the Ammonites.
07011030 And Jephthah made a vow to the Lord: “If you give the Ammonites into my hands,
07011031 whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the Lord’s, and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering.”
07011032 Then Jephthah went over to fight the Ammonites, and the Lord gave them into his hands.
07011033 He devastated twenty towns from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith, as far as Abel Keramim. Thus Israel subdued Ammon.
07011034 When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, who should come out to meet him but his daughter, dancing to the sound of timbrels! She was an only child. Except for her he had neither son nor daughter.
07011035 When he saw her, he tore his clothes and cried, “Oh no, my daughter! You have brought me down and I am devastated. I have made a vow to the Lord that I cannot break.”
07011036 “My father,” she replied, “you have given your word to the Lord. Do to me just as you promised, now that the Lord has avenged you of your enemies, the Ammonites.
07011037 But grant me this one request,” she said. “Give me two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends, because I will never marry.”
07011038 “You may go,” he said. And he let her go for two months. She and her friends went into the hills and wept because she would never marry.
07011039 After the two months, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. And she was a virgin. From this comes the Israelite tradition
07011040 that each year the young women of Israel go out for four days to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.
07012001 The Ephraimite forces were called out, and they crossed over to Zaphon. They said to Jephthah, “Why did you go to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? We’re going to burn down your house over your head.”
07012002 Jephthah answered, “I and my people were engaged in a great struggle with the Ammonites, and although I called, you didn’t save me out of their hands.
07012003 When I saw that you wouldn’t help, I took my life in my hands and crossed over to fight the Ammonites, and the Lord gave me the victory over them. Now why have you come up today to fight me?”
07012004 Jephthah then called together the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. The Gileadites struck them down because the Ephraimites had said, “You Gileadites are renegades from Ephraim and Manasseh.”
07012005 The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Ephraim, and whenever a survivor of Ephraim said, “Let me cross over,” the men of Gilead asked him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he replied, “No,”
07012006 they said, “All right, say ‘Shibboleth.’ ” If he said, “Sibboleth,” because he could not pronounce the word correctly, they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. Forty-two thousand Ephraimites were killed at that time.
07012007 Jephthah led Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in a town in Gilead.
07012008 After him, Ibzan of Bethlehem led Israel.
07012009 He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He gave his daughters away in marriage to those outside his clan, and for his sons he brought in thirty young women as wives from outside his clan. Ibzan led Israel seven years.
07012010 Then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem.
07012011 After him, Elon the Zebulunite led Israel ten years.
07012012 Then Elon died and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
07012013 After him, Abdon son of Hillel, from Pirathon, led Israel.
07012014 He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys. He led Israel eight years.
07012015 Then Abdon son of Hillel died and was buried at Pirathon in Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
07013001 Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord, so the Lord delivered them into the hands of the Philistines for forty years.
07013002 A certain man of Zorah, named Manoah, from the clan of the Danites, had a wife who was childless, unable to give birth.
07013003 The angel of the Lord appeared to her and said, “You are barren and childless, but you are going to become pregnant and give birth to a son.
07013004 Now see to it that you drink no wine or other fermented drink and that you do not eat anything unclean.
07013005 You will become pregnant and have a son whose head is never to be touched by a razor because the boy is to be a Nazirite, dedicated to God from the womb. He will take the lead in delivering Israel from the hands of the Philistines.”
07013006 Then the woman went to her husband and told him, “A man of God came to me. He looked like an angel of God, very awesome. I didn’t ask him where he came from, and he didn’t tell me his name.
07013007 But he said to me, ‘You will become pregnant and have a son. Now then, drink no wine or other fermented drink and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite of God from the womb until the day of his death.’ ”
07013008 Then Manoah prayed to the Lord: “Pardon your servant, Lord. I beg you to let the man of God you sent to us come again to teach us how to bring up the boy who is to be born.”
07013009 God heard Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman while she was out in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her.
07013010 The woman hurried to tell her husband, “He’s here! The man who appeared to me the other day!”
07013011 Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he said, “Are you the man who talked to my wife?” “I am,” he said.
07013012 So Manoah asked him, “When your words are fulfilled, what is to be the rule that governs the boy’s life and work?”
07013013 The angel of the Lord answered, “Your wife must do all that I have told her.
07013014 She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, nor drink any wine or other fermented drink nor eat anything unclean. She must do everything I have commanded her.”
07013015 Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, “We would like you to stay until we prepare a young goat for you.”
07013016 The angel of the Lord replied, “Even though you detain me, I will not eat any of your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the Lord.” (Manoah did not realize that it was the angel of the Lord.)
07013017 Then Manoah inquired of the angel of the Lord, “What is your name, so that we may honor you when your word comes true?”
07013018 He replied, “Why do you ask my name? It is beyond understanding. ”
07013019 Then Manoah took a young goat, together with the grain offering, and sacrificed it on a rock to the Lord. And the Lord did an amazing thing while Manoah and his wife watched:
07013020 As the flame blazed up from the altar toward heaven, the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame. Seeing this, Manoah and his wife fell with their faces to the ground.
07013021 When the angel of the Lord did not show himself again to Manoah and his wife, Manoah realized that it was the angel of the Lord.
07013022 “We are doomed to die!” he said to his wife. “We have seen God!”
07013023 But his wife answered, “If the Lord had meant to kill us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and grain offering from our hands, nor shown us all these things or now told us this.”
07013024 The woman gave birth to a boy and named him Samson. He grew and the Lord blessed him,
07013025 and the Spirit of the Lord began to stir him while he was in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
07014001 Samson went down to Timnah and saw there a young Philistine woman.
07014002 When he returned, he said to his father and mother, “I have seen a Philistine woman in Timnah; now get her for me as my wife.”
07014003 His father and mother replied, “Isn’t there an acceptable woman among your relatives or among all our people? Must you go to the uncircumcised Philistines to get a wife?” But Samson said to his father, “Get her for me. She’s the right one for me.”
07014004 (His parents did not know that this was from the Lord, who was seeking an occasion to confront the Philistines; for at that time they were ruling over Israel.)
07014005 Samson went down to Timnah together with his father and mother. As they approached the vineyards of Timnah, suddenly a young lion came roaring toward him.
07014006 The Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him so that he tore the lion apart with his bare hands as he might have torn a young goat. But he told neither his father nor his mother what he had done.
07014007 Then he went down and talked with the woman, and he liked her.
07014008 Some time later, when he went back to marry her, he turned aside to look at the lion’s carcass, and in it he saw a swarm of bees and some honey.
07014009 He scooped out the honey with his hands and ate as he went along. When he rejoined his parents, he gave them some, and they too ate it. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the lion’s carcass.
07014010 Now his father went down to see the woman. And there Samson held a feast, as was customary for young men.
07014011 When the people saw him, they chose thirty men to be his companions.
07014012 “Let me tell you a riddle,” Samson said to them. “If you can give me the answer within the seven days of the feast, I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.
07014013 If you can’t tell me the answer, you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.” “Tell us your riddle,” they said. “Let’s hear it.”
07014014 He replied, “Out of the eater, something to eat; out of the strong, something sweet.” For three days they could not give the answer.
07014015 On the fourth day, they said to Samson’s wife, “Coax your husband into explaining the riddle for us, or we will burn you and your father’s household to death. Did you invite us here to steal our property?”
07014016 Then Samson’s wife threw herself on him, sobbing, “You hate me! You don’t really love me. You’ve given my people a riddle, but you haven’t told me the answer.” “I haven’t even explained it to my father or mother,” he replied, “so why should I explain it to you?”
07014017 She cried the whole seven days of the feast. So on the seventh day he finally told her, because she continued to press him. She in turn explained the riddle to her people.
07014018 Before sunset on the seventh day the men of the town said to him, “What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?” Samson said to them, “If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have solved my riddle.”
07014019 Then the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him. He went down to Ashkelon, struck down thirty of their men, stripped them of everything and gave their clothes to those who had explained the riddle. Burning with anger, he returned to his father’s home.
07014020 And Samson’s wife was given to one of his companions who had attended him at the feast.
07015001 Later on, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat and went to visit his wife. He said, “I’m going to my wife’s room.” But her father would not let him go in.
07015002 “I was so sure you hated her,” he said, “that I gave her to your companion. Isn’t her younger sister more attractive? Take her instead.”
07015003 Samson said to them, “This time I have a right to get even with the Philistines; I will really harm them.”
07015004 So he went out and caught three hundred foxes and tied them tail to tail in pairs. He then fastened a torch to every pair of tails,
07015005 lit the torches and let the foxes loose in the standing grain of the Philistines. He burned up the shocks and standing grain, together with the vineyards and olive groves.
07015006 When the Philistines asked, “Who did this?” they were told, “Samson, the Timnite’s son-in-law, because his wife was given to his companion.” So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father to death.
07015007 Samson said to them, “Since you’ve acted like this, I swear that I won’t stop until I get my revenge on you.”
07015008 He attacked them viciously and slaughtered many of them. Then he went down and stayed in a cave in the rock of Etam.
07015009 The Philistines went up and camped in Judah, spreading out near Lehi.
07015010 The people of Judah asked, “Why have you come to fight us?” “We have come to take Samson prisoner,” they answered, “to do to him as he did to us.”
07015011 Then three thousand men from Judah went down to the cave in the rock of Etam and said to Samson, “Don’t you realize that the Philistines are rulers over us? What have you done to us?” He answered, “I merely did to them what they did to me.”
07015012 They said to him, “We’ve come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines.” Samson said, “Swear to me that you won’t kill me yourselves.”
07015013 “Agreed,” they answered. “We will only tie you up and hand you over to them. We will not kill you.” So they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock.
07015014 As he approached Lehi, the Philistines came toward him shouting. The Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him. The ropes on his arms became like charred flax, and the bindings dropped from his hands.
07015015 Finding a fresh jawbone of a donkey, he grabbed it and struck down a thousand men.
07015016 Then Samson said, “With a donkey’s jawbone I have made donkeys of them. With a donkey’s jawbone I have killed a thousand men.”
07015017 When he finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone; and the place was called Ramath Lehi.
07015018 Because he was very thirsty, he cried out to the Lord, “You have given your servant this great victory. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?”
07015019 Then God opened up the hollow place in Lehi, and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his strength returned and he revived. So the spring was called En Hakkore, and it is still there in Lehi.
07015020 Samson led Israel for twenty years in the days of the Philistines.
07016001 One day Samson went to Gaza, where he saw a prostitute. He went in to spend the night with her.
07016002 The people of Gaza were told, “Samson is here!” So they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They made no move during the night, saying, “At dawn we’ll kill him.”
07016003 But Samson lay there only until the middle of the night. Then he got up and took hold of the doors of the city gate, together with the two posts, and tore them loose, bar and all. He lifted them to his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron.
07016004 Some time later, he fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah.
07016005 The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, “See if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him up and subdue him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver.”
07016006 So Delilah said to Samson, “Tell me the secret of your great strength and how you can be tied up and subdued.”
07016007 Samson answered her, “If anyone ties me with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, I’ll become as weak as any other man.”
07016008 Then the rulers of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried, and she tied him with them.
07016009 With men hidden in the room, she called to him, “Samson, the Philistines are upon you!” But he snapped the bowstrings as easily as a piece of string snaps when it comes close to a flame. So the secret of his strength was not discovered.
07016010 Then Delilah said to Samson, “You have made a fool of me; you lied to me. Come now, tell me how you can be tied.”
07016011 He said, “If anyone ties me securely with new ropes that have never been used, I’ll become as weak as any other man.”
07016012 So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them. Then, with men hidden in the room, she called to him, “Samson, the Philistines are upon you!” But he snapped the ropes off his arms as if they were threads.
07016013 Delilah then said to Samson, “All this time you have been making a fool of me and lying to me. Tell me how you can be tied.” He replied, “If you weave the seven braids of my head into the fabric on the loom and tighten it with the pin, I’ll become as weak as any other man.” So while he was sleeping, Delilah took the seven braids of his head, wove them into the fabric
07016014 and tightened it with the pin. Again she called to him, “Samson, the Philistines are upon you!” He awoke from his sleep and pulled up the pin and the loom, with the fabric.
07016015 Then she said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when you won’t confide in me? This is the third time you have made a fool of me and haven’t told me the secret of your great strength.”
07016016 With such nagging she prodded him day after day until he was sick to death of it.
07016017 So he told her everything. “No razor has ever been used on my head,” he said, “because I have been a Nazirite dedicated to God from my mother’s womb. If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me, and I would become as weak as any other man.”
07016018 When Delilah saw that he had told her everything, she sent word to the rulers of the Philistines, “Come back once more; he has told me everything.” So the rulers of the Philistines returned with the silver in their hands.
07016019 After putting him to sleep on her lap, she called for someone to shave off the seven braids of his hair, and so began to subdue him. And his strength left him.
07016020 Then she called, “Samson, the Philistines are upon you!” He awoke from his sleep and thought, “I’ll go out as before and shake myself free.” But he did not know that the Lord had left him.
07016021 Then the Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes and took him down to Gaza. Binding him with bronze shackles, they set him to grinding grain in the prison.
07016022 But the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.
07016023 Now the rulers of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, saying, “Our god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hands.”
07016024 When the people saw him, they praised their god, saying, “Our god has delivered our enemy into our hands, the one who laid waste our land and multiplied our slain.”
07016025 While they were in high spirits, they shouted, “Bring out Samson to entertain us.” So they called Samson out of the prison, and he performed for them. When they stood him among the pillars,
07016026 Samson said to the servant who held his hand, “Put me where I can feel the pillars that support the temple, so that I may lean against them.”
07016027 Now the temple was crowded with men and women; all the rulers of the Philistines were there, and on the roof were about three thousand men and women watching Samson perform.
07016028 Then Samson prayed to the Lord, “Sovereign Lord, remember me. Please, God, strengthen me just once more, and let me with one blow get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes.”
07016029 Then Samson reached toward the two central pillars on which the temple stood. Bracing himself against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other,
07016030 Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” Then he pushed with all his might, and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it. Thus he killed many more when he died than while he lived.
07016031 Then his brothers and his father’s whole family went down to get him. They brought him back and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had led Israel twenty years.
07017001 Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim
07017002 said to his mother, “The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard you utter a curse—I have that silver with me; I took it.” Then his mother said, “The Lord bless you, my son!”
07017003 When he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said, “I solemnly consecrate my silver to the Lord for my son to make an image overlaid with silver. I will give it back to you.”
07017004 So after he returned the silver to his mother, she took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who used them to make the idol. And it was put in Micah’s house.
07017005 Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some household gods and installed one of his sons as his priest.
07017006 In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit.
07017007 A young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, who had been living within the clan of Judah,
07017008 left that town in search of some other place to stay. On his way he came to Micah’s house in the hill country of Ephraim.
07017009 Micah asked him, “Where are you from?” “I’m a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah,” he said, “and I’m looking for a place to stay.”
07017010 Then Micah said to him, “Live with me and be my father and priest, and I’ll give you ten shekels of silver a year, your clothes and your food.”
07017011 So the Levite agreed to live with him, and the young man became like one of his sons to him.
07017012 Then Micah installed the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in his house.
07017013 And Micah said, “Now I know that the Lord will be good to me, since this Levite has become my priest.”
07018001 In those days Israel had no king. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking a place of their own where they might settle, because they had not yet come into an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
07018002 So the Danites sent five of their leading men from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land and explore it. These men represented all the Danites. They told them, “Go, explore the land.” So they entered the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah, where they spent the night.
07018003 When they were near Micah’s house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite; so they turned in there and asked him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? Why are you here?”
07018004 He told them what Micah had done for him, and said, “He has hired me and I am his priest.”
07018005 Then they said to him, “Please inquire of God to learn whether our journey will be successful.”
07018006 The priest answered them, “Go in peace. Your journey has the Lord’s approval.”
07018007 So the five men left and came to Laish, where they saw that the people were living in safety, like the Sidonians, at peace and secure. And since their land lacked nothing, they were prosperous. Also, they lived a long way from the Sidonians and had no relationship with anyone else.
07018008 When they returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their fellow Danites asked them, “How did you find things?”
07018009 They answered, “Come on, let’s attack them! We have seen the land, and it is very good. Aren’t you going to do something? Don’t hesitate to go there and take it over.
07018010 When you get there, you will find an unsuspecting people and a spacious land that God has put into your hands, a land that lacks nothing whatever.”
07018011 Then six hundred men of the Danites, armed for battle, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol.
07018012 On their way they set up camp near Kiriath Jearim in Judah. This is why the place west of Kiriath Jearim is called Mahaneh Dan to this day.
07018013 From there they went on to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah’s house.
07018014 Then the five men who had spied out the land of Laish said to their fellow Danites, “Do you know that one of these houses has an ephod, some household gods and an image overlaid with silver? Now you know what to do.”
07018015 So they turned in there and went to the house of the young Levite at Micah’s place and greeted him.
07018016 The six hundred Danites, armed for battle, stood at the entrance of the gate.
07018017 The five men who had spied out the land went inside and took the idol, the ephod and the household gods while the priest and the six hundred armed men stood at the entrance of the gate.
07018018 When the five men went into Micah’s house and took the idol, the ephod and the household gods, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”
07018019 They answered him, “Be quiet! Don’t say a word. Come with us, and be our father and priest. Isn’t it better that you serve a tribe and clan in Israel as priest rather than just one man’s household?”
07018020 The priest was very pleased. He took the ephod, the household gods and the idol and went along with the people.
07018021 Putting their little children, their livestock and their possessions in front of them, they turned away and left.
07018022 When they had gone some distance from Micah’s house, the men who lived near Micah were called together and overtook the Danites.
07018023 As they shouted after them, the Danites turned and said to Micah, “What’s the matter with you that you called out your men to fight?”
07018024 He replied, “You took the gods I made, and my priest, and went away. What else do I have? How can you ask, ‘What’s the matter with you?’ ”
07018025 The Danites answered, “Don’t argue with us, or some of the men may get angry and attack you, and you and your family will lose your lives.”
07018026 So the Danites went their way, and Micah, seeing that they were too strong for him, turned around and went back home.
07018027 Then they took what Micah had made, and his priest, and went on to Laish, against a people at peace and secure. They attacked them with the sword and burned down their city.
07018028 There was no one to rescue them because they lived a long way from Sidon and had no relationship with anyone else. The city was in a valley near Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt the city and settled there.
07018029 They named it Dan after their ancestor Dan, who was born to Israel—though the city used to be called Laish.
07018030 There the Danites set up for themselves the idol, and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the time of the captivity of the land.
07018031 They continued to use the idol Micah had made, all the time the house of God was in Shiloh.
07019001 In those days Israel had no king. Now a Levite who lived in a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim took a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.
07019002 But she was unfaithful to him. She left him and went back to her parents’ home in Bethlehem, Judah. After she had been there four months,
07019003 her husband went to her to persuade her to return. He had with him his servant and two donkeys. She took him into her parents’ home, and when her father saw him, he gladly welcomed him.
07019004 His father-in-law, the woman’s father, prevailed on him to stay; so he remained with him three days, eating and drinking, and sleeping there.
07019005 On the fourth day they got up early and he prepared to leave, but the woman’s father said to his son-in-law, “Refresh yourself with something to eat; then you can go.”
07019006 So the two of them sat down to eat and drink together. Afterward the woman’s father said, “Please stay tonight and enjoy yourself.”
07019007 And when the man got up to go, his father-in-law persuaded him, so he stayed there that night.
07019008 On the morning of the fifth day, when he rose to go, the woman’s father said, “Refresh yourself. Wait till afternoon!” So the two of them ate together.
07019009 Then when the man, with his concubine and his servant, got up to leave, his father-in-law, the woman’s father, said, “Now look, it’s almost evening. Spend the night here; the day is nearly over. Stay and enjoy yourself. Early tomorrow morning you can get up and be on your way home.”
07019010 But, unwilling to stay another night, the man left and went toward Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine.
07019011 When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant said to his master, “Come, let’s stop at this city of the Jebusites and spend the night.”
07019012 His master replied, “No. We won’t go into any city whose people are not Israelites. We will go on to Gibeah.”
07019013 He added, “Come, let’s try to reach Gibeah or Ramah and spend the night in one of those places.”
07019014 So they went on, and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin.
07019015 There they stopped to spend the night. They went and sat in the city square, but no one took them in for the night.
07019016 That evening an old man from the hill country of Ephraim, who was living in Gibeah (the inhabitants of the place were Benjamites), came in from his work in the fields.
07019017 When he looked and saw the traveler in the city square, the old man asked, “Where are you going? Where did you come from?”
07019018 He answered, “We are on our way from Bethlehem in Judah to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim where I live. I have been to Bethlehem in Judah and now I am going to the house of the Lord. No one has taken me in for the night.
07019019 We have both straw and fodder for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves your servants—me, the woman and the young man with us. We don’t need anything.”
07019020 “You are welcome at my house,” the old man said. “Let me supply whatever you need. Only don’t spend the night in the square.”
07019021 So he took him into his house and fed his donkeys. After they had washed their feet, they had something to eat and drink.
07019022 While they were enjoying themselves, some of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they shouted to the old man who owned the house, “Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him.”
07019023 The owner of the house went outside and said to them, “No, my friends, don’t be so vile. Since this man is my guest, don’t do this outrageous thing.
07019024 Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But as for this man, don’t do such an outrageous thing.”
07019025 But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go.
07019026 At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell down at the door and lay there until daylight.
07019027 When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way, there lay his concubine, fallen in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold.
07019028 He said to her, “Get up; let’s go.” But there was no answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home.
07019029 When he reached home, he took a knife and cut up his concubine, limb by limb, into twelve parts and sent them into all the areas of Israel.
07019030 Everyone who saw it was saying to one another, “Such a thing has never been seen or done, not since the day the Israelites came up out of Egypt. Just imagine! We must do something! So speak up!”
07020001 Then all Israel from Dan to Beersheba and from the land of Gilead came together as one and assembled before the Lord in Mizpah.
07020002 The leaders of all the people of the tribes of Israel took their places in the assembly of God’s people, four hundred thousand men armed with swords.
07020003 (The Benjamites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah.) Then the Israelites said, “Tell us how this awful thing happened.”
07020004 So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, said, “I and my concubine came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night.
07020005 During the night the men of Gibeah came after me and surrounded the house, intending to kill me. They raped my concubine, and she died.
07020006 I took my concubine, cut her into pieces and sent one piece to each region of Israel’s inheritance, because they committed this lewd and outrageous act in Israel.
07020007 Now, all you Israelites, speak up and tell me what you have decided to do.”
07020008 All the men rose up together as one, saying, “None of us will go home. No, not one of us will return to his house.
07020009 But now this is what we’ll do to Gibeah: We’ll go up against it in the order decided by casting lots.
07020010 We’ll take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred from a thousand, and a thousand from ten thousand, to get provisions for the army. Then, when the army arrives at Gibeah in Benjamin, it can give them what they deserve for this outrageous act done in Israel.”
07020011 So all the Israelites got together and united as one against the city.
07020012 The tribes of Israel sent messengers throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What about this awful crime that was committed among you?
07020013 Now turn those wicked men of Gibeah over to us so that we may put them to death and purge the evil from Israel.” But the Benjamites would not listen to their fellow Israelites.
07020014 From their towns they came together at Gibeah to fight against the Israelites.
07020015 At once the Benjamites mobilized twenty-six thousand swordsmen from their towns, in addition to seven hundred able young men from those living in Gibeah.
07020016 Among all these soldiers there were seven hundred select troops who were left-handed, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.
07020017 Israel, apart from Benjamin, mustered four hundred thousand swordsmen, all of them fit for battle.
07020018 The Israelites went up to Bethel and inquired of God. They said, “Who of us is to go up first to fight against the Benjamites?” The Lord replied, “Judah shall go first.”
07020019 The next morning the Israelites got up and pitched camp near Gibeah.
07020020 The Israelites went out to fight the Benjamites and took up battle positions against them at Gibeah.
07020021 The Benjamites came out of Gibeah and cut down twenty-two thousand Israelites on the battlefield that day.
07020022 But the Israelites encouraged one another and again took up their positions where they had stationed themselves the first day.
07020023 The Israelites went up and wept before the Lord until evening, and they inquired of the Lord. They said, “Shall we go up again to fight against the Benjamites, our fellow Israelites?” The Lord answered, “Go up against them.”
07020024 Then the Israelites drew near to Benjamin the second day.
07020025 This time, when the Benjamites came out from Gibeah to oppose them, they cut down another eighteen thousand Israelites, all of them armed with swords.
07020026 Then all the Israelites, the whole army, went up to Bethel, and there they sat weeping before the Lord. They fasted that day until evening and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to the Lord.
07020027 And the Israelites inquired of the Lord. (In those days the ark of the covenant of God was there,
07020028 with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, ministering before it.) They asked, “Shall we go up again to fight against the Benjamites, our fellow Israelites, or not?” The Lord responded, “Go, for tomorrow I will give them into your hands.”
07020029 Then Israel set an ambush around Gibeah.
07020030 They went up against the Benjamites on the third day and took up positions against Gibeah as they had done before.
07020031 The Benjamites came out to meet them and were drawn away from the city. They began to inflict casualties on the Israelites as before, so that about thirty men fell in the open field and on the roads—the one leading to Bethel and the other to Gibeah.
07020032 While the Benjamites were saying, “We are defeating them as before,” the Israelites were saying, “Let’s retreat and draw them away from the city to the roads.”
07020033 All the men of Israel moved from their places and took up positions at Baal Tamar, and the Israelite ambush charged out of its place on the west of Gibeah.
07020034 Then ten thousand of Israel’s able young men made a frontal attack on Gibeah. The fighting was so heavy that the Benjamites did not realize how near disaster was.
07020035 The Lord defeated Benjamin before Israel, and on that day the Israelites struck down 25,100 Benjamites, all armed with swords.
07020036 Then the Benjamites saw that they were beaten. Now the men of Israel had given way before Benjamin, because they relied on the ambush they had set near Gibeah.
07020037 Those who had been in ambush made a sudden dash into Gibeah, spread out and put the whole city to the sword.
07020038 The Israelites had arranged with the ambush that they should send up a great cloud of smoke from the city,
07020039 and then the Israelites would counterattack. The Benjamites had begun to inflict casualties on the Israelites (about thirty), and they said, “We are defeating them as in the first battle.”
07020040 But when the column of smoke began to rise from the city, the Benjamites turned and saw the whole city going up in smoke.
07020041 Then the Israelites counterattacked, and the Benjamites were terrified, because they realized that disaster had come on them.
07020042 So they fled before the Israelites in the direction of the wilderness, but they could not escape the battle. And the Israelites who came out of the towns cut them down there.
07020043 They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them and easily overran them in the vicinity of Gibeah on the east.
07020044 Eighteen thousand Benjamites fell, all of them valiant fighters.
07020045 As they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, the Israelites cut down five thousand men along the roads. They kept pressing after the Benjamites as far as Gidom and struck down two thousand more.
07020046 On that day twenty-five thousand Benjamite swordsmen fell, all of them valiant fighters.
07020047 But six hundred of them turned and fled into the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed four months.
07020048 The men of Israel went back to Benjamin and put all the towns to the sword, including the animals and everything else they found. All the towns they came across they set on fire.
07021001 The men of Israel had taken an oath at Mizpah: “Not one of us will give his daughter in marriage to a Benjamite.”
07021002 The people went to Bethel, where they sat before God until evening, raising their voices and weeping bitterly.
07021003 “Lord, God of Israel,” they cried, “why has this happened to Israel? Why should one tribe be missing from Israel today?”
07021004 Early the next day the people built an altar and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.
07021005 Then the Israelites asked, “Who from all the tribes of Israel has failed to assemble before the Lord?” For they had taken a solemn oath that anyone who failed to assemble before the Lord at Mizpah was to be put to death.
07021006 Now the Israelites grieved for the tribe of Benjamin, their fellow Israelites. “Today one tribe is cut off from Israel,” they said.
07021007 “How can we provide wives for those who are left, since we have taken an oath by the Lord not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?”
07021008 Then they asked, “Which one of the tribes of Israel failed to assemble before the Lord at Mizpah?” They discovered that no one from Jabesh Gilead had come to the camp for the assembly.
07021009 For when they counted the people, they found that none of the people of Jabesh Gilead were there.
07021010 So the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to go to Jabesh Gilead and put to the sword those living there, including the women and children.
07021011 “This is what you are to do,” they said. “Kill every male and every woman who is not a virgin.”
07021012 They found among the people living in Jabesh Gilead four hundred young women who had never slept with a man, and they took them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan.
07021013 Then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon.
07021014 So the Benjamites returned at that time and were given the women of Jabesh Gilead who had been spared. But there were not enough for all of them.
07021015 The people grieved for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a gap in the tribes of Israel.
07021016 And the elders of the assembly said, “With the women of Benjamin destroyed, how shall we provide wives for the men who are left?
07021017 The Benjamite survivors must have heirs,” they said, “so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out.
07021018 We can’t give them our daughters as wives, since we Israelites have taken this oath: ‘Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.’
07021019 But look, there is the annual festival of the Lord in Shiloh, which lies north of Bethel, east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.”
07021020 So they instructed the Benjamites, saying, “Go and hide in the vineyards
07021021 and watch. When the young women of Shiloh come out to join in the dancing, rush from the vineyards and each of you seize one of them to be your wife. Then return to the land of Benjamin.
07021022 When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we will say to them, ‘Do us the favor of helping them, because we did not get wives for them during the war. You will not be guilty of breaking your oath because you did not give your daughters to them.’ ”
07021023 So that is what the Benjamites did. While the young women were dancing, each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife. Then they returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in them.
07021024 At that time the Israelites left that place and went home to their tribes and clans, each to his own inheritance.
07021025 In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit.
08001001 In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land. So a man from Bethlehem in Judah, together with his wife and two sons, went to live for a while in the country of Moab.
08001002 The man’s name was Elimelek, his wife’s name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to Moab and lived there.
08001003 Now Elimelek, Naomi’s husband, died, and she was left with her two sons.
08001004 They married Moabite women, one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years,
08001005 both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.
08001006 When Naomi heard in Moab that the Lord had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them, she and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there.
08001007 With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah.
08001008 Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back, each of you, to your mother’s home. May the Lord show you kindness, as you have shown kindness to your dead husbands and to me.
08001009 May the Lord grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband.” Then she kissed them goodbye and they wept aloud
08001010 and said to her, “We will go back with you to your people.”
08001011 But Naomi said, “Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands?
08001012 Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me—even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons—
08001013 would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the Lord’s hand has turned against me!”
08001014 At this they wept aloud again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her.
08001015 “Look,” said Naomi, “your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her.”
08001016 But Ruth replied, “Don’t urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God.
08001017 Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely, if even death separates you and me.”
08001018 When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.
08001019 So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, “Can this be Naomi?”
08001020 “Don’t call me Naomi, ” she told them. “Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter.
08001021 I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The Lord has afflicted me; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me.”
08001022 So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabite, her daughter-in-law, arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.
08002001 Now Naomi had a relative on her husband’s side, a man of standing from the clan of Elimelek, whose name was Boaz.
08002002 And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor.” Naomi said to her, “Go ahead, my daughter.”
08002003 So she went out, entered a field and began to glean behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she was working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelek.
08002004 Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, “The Lord be with you!” “The Lord bless you!” they answered.
08002005 Boaz asked the overseer of his harvesters, “Who does that young woman belong to?”
08002006 The overseer replied, “She is the Moabite who came back from Moab with Naomi.
08002007 She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters.’ She came into the field and has remained here from morning till now, except for a short rest in the shelter.”
08002008 So Boaz said to Ruth, “My daughter, listen to me. Don’t go and glean in another field and don’t go away from here. Stay here with the women who work for me.
08002009 Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the women. I have told the men not to lay a hand on you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled.”
08002010 At this, she bowed down with her face to the ground. She asked him, “Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me—a foreigner?”
08002011 Boaz replied, “I’ve been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband—how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before.
08002012 May the Lord repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.”
08002013 “May I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord,” she said. “You have put me at ease by speaking kindly to your servant—though I do not have the standing of one of your servants.”
08002014 At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar.” When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over.
08002015 As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, “Let her gather among the sheaves and don’t reprimand her.
08002016 Even pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up, and don’t rebuke her.”
08002017 So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed the barley she had gathered, and it amounted to about an ephah.
08002018 She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough.
08002019 Her mother-in-law asked her, “Where did you glean today? Where did you work? Blessed be the man who took notice of you!” Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. “The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz,” she said.
08002020 “The Lord bless him!” Naomi said to her daughter-in-law. “He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead.” She added, “That man is our close relative; he is one of our guardian-redeemers. ”
08002021 Then Ruth the Moabite said, “He even said to me, ‘Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain.’ ”
08002022 Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It will be good for you, my daughter, to go with the women who work for him, because in someone else’s field you might be harmed.”
08002023 So Ruth stayed close to the women of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
08003001 One day Ruth’s mother-in-law Naomi said to her, “My daughter, I must find a home for you, where you will be well provided for.
08003002 Now Boaz, with whose women you have worked, is a relative of ours. Tonight he will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor.
08003003 Wash, put on perfume, and get dressed in your best clothes. Then go down to the threshing floor, but don’t let him know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking.
08003004 When he lies down, note the place where he is lying. Then go and uncover his feet and lie down. He will tell you what to do.”
08003005 “I will do whatever you say,” Ruth answered.
08003006 So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law told her to do.
08003007 When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he went over to lie down at the far end of the grain pile. Ruth approached quietly, uncovered his feet and lay down.
08003008 In the middle of the night something startled the man; he turned—and there was a woman lying at his feet!
08003009 “Who are you?” he asked. “I am your servant Ruth,” she said. “Spread the corner of your garment over me, since you are a guardian-redeemer of our family.”
08003010 “The Lord bless you, my daughter,” he replied. “This kindness is greater than that which you showed earlier: You have not run after the younger men, whether rich or poor.
08003011 And now, my daughter, don’t be afraid. I will do for you all you ask. All the people of my town know that you are a woman of noble character.
08003012 Although it is true that I am a guardian-redeemer of our family, there is another who is more closely related than I.
08003013 Stay here for the night, and in the morning if he wants to do his duty as your guardian-redeemer, good; let him redeem you. But if he is not willing, as surely as the Lord lives I will do it. Lie here until morning.”
08003014 So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before anyone could be recognized; and he said, “No one must know that a woman came to the threshing floor.”
08003015 He also said, “Bring me the shawl you are wearing and hold it out.” When she did so, he poured into it six measures of barley and placed the bundle on her. Then he went back to town.
08003016 When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, “How did it go, my daughter?” Then she told her everything Boaz had done for her
08003017 and added, “He gave me these six measures of barley, saying, ‘Don’t go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’ ”
08003018 Then Naomi said, “Wait, my daughter, until you find out what happens. For the man will not rest until the matter is settled today.”
08004001 Meanwhile Boaz went up to the town gate and sat down there just as the guardian-redeemer he had mentioned came along. Boaz said, “Come over here, my friend, and sit down.” So he went over and sat down.
08004002 Boaz took ten of the elders of the town and said, “Sit here,” and they did so.
08004003 Then he said to the guardian-redeemer, “Naomi, who has come back from Moab, is selling the piece of land that belonged to our relative Elimelek.
08004004 I thought I should bring the matter to your attention and suggest that you buy it in the presence of these seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, do so. But if you will not, tell me, so I will know. For no one has the right to do it except you, and I am next in line.” “I will redeem it,” he said.
08004005 Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the land from Naomi, you also acquire Ruth the Moabite, the dead man’s widow, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property.”
08004006 At this, the guardian-redeemer said, “Then I cannot redeem it because I might endanger my own estate. You redeem it yourself. I cannot do it.”
08004007 (Now in earlier times in Israel, for the redemption and transfer of property to become final, one party took off his sandal and gave it to the other. This was the method of legalizing transactions in Israel.)
08004008 So the guardian-redeemer said to Boaz, “Buy it yourself.” And he removed his sandal.
08004009 Then Boaz announced to the elders and all the people, “Today you are witnesses that I have bought from Naomi all the property of Elimelek, Kilion and Mahlon.
08004010 I have also acquired Ruth the Moabite, Mahlon’s widow, as my wife, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property, so that his name will not disappear from among his family or from his hometown. Today you are witnesses!”
08004011 Then the elders and all the people at the gate said, “We are witnesses. May the Lord make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the family of Israel. May you have standing in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem.
08004012 Through the offspring the Lord gives you by this young woman, may your family be like that of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah.”
08004013 So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. When he made love to her, the Lord enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son.
08004014 The women said to Naomi: “Praise be to the Lord, who this day has not left you without a guardian-redeemer. May he become famous throughout Israel!
08004015 He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and who is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth.”
08004016 Then Naomi took the child in her arms and cared for him.
08004017 The women living there said, “Naomi has a son!” And they named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.
08004018 This, then, is the family line of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron,
08004019 Hezron the father of Ram, Ram the father of Amminadab,
08004020 Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon,
08004021 Salmon the father of Boaz, Boaz the father of Obed,
08004022 Obed the father of Jesse, and Jesse the father of David.
09001001 There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.
09001002 He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.
09001003 Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the Lord Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the Lord.
09001004 Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.
09001005 But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the Lord had closed her womb.
09001006 Because the Lord had closed Hannah’s womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her.
09001007 This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the Lord, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat.
09001008 Her husband Elkanah would say to her, “Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don’t you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don’t I mean more to you than ten sons?”
09001009 Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his chair by the doorpost of the Lord’s house.
09001010 In her deep anguish Hannah prayed to the Lord, weeping bitterly.
09001011 And she made a vow, saying, “Lord Almighty, if you will only look on your servant’s misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the Lord for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head.”
09001012 As she kept on praying to the Lord, Eli observed her mouth.
09001013 Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk
09001014 and said to her, “How long are you going to stay drunk? Put away your wine.”
09001015 “Not so, my lord,” Hannah replied, “I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to the Lord.
09001016 Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief.”
09001017 Eli answered, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him.”
09001018 She said, “May your servant find favor in your eyes.” Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast.
09001019 Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the Lord and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah made love to his wife Hannah, and the Lord remembered her.
09001020 So in the course of time Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, saying, “Because I asked the Lord for him.”
09001021 When her husband Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the Lord and to fulfill his vow,
09001022 Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, “After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before the Lord, and he will live there always.”
09001023 “Do what seems best to you,” her husband Elkanah told her. “Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the Lord make good his word.” So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him.
09001024 After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh.
09001025 When the bull had been sacrificed, they brought the boy to Eli,
09001026 and she said to him, “Pardon me, my lord. As surely as you live, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the Lord.
09001027 I prayed for this child, and the Lord has granted me what I asked of him.
09001028 So now I give him to the Lord. For his whole life he will be given over to the Lord.” And he worshiped the Lord there.
09002001 Then Hannah prayed and said: “My heart rejoices in the Lord; in the Lord my horn is lifted high. My mouth boasts over my enemies, for I delight in your deliverance.
09002002 “There is no one holy like the Lord; there is no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God.
09002003 “Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak such arrogance, for the Lord is a God who knows, and by him deeds are weighed.
09002004 “The bows of the warriors are broken, but those who stumbled are armed with strength.
09002005 Those who were full hire themselves out for food, but those who were hungry are hungry no more. She who was barren has borne seven children, but she who has had many sons pines away.
09002006 “The Lord brings death and makes alive; he brings down to the grave and raises up.
09002007 The Lord sends poverty and wealth; he humbles and he exalts.
09002008 He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; he seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor. “For the foundations of the earth are the Lord’s; on them he has set the world.
09002009 He will guard the feet of his faithful servants, but the wicked will be silenced in the place of darkness. “It is not by strength that one prevails;
09002010 those who oppose the Lord will be broken. The Most High will thunder from heaven; the Lord will judge the ends of the earth. “He will give strength to his king and exalt the horn of his anointed.”
09002011 Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy ministered before the Lord under Eli the priest.
09002012 Eli’s sons were scoundrels; they had no regard for the Lord.
09002013 Now it was the practice of the priests that, whenever any of the people offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand while the meat was being boiled
09002014 and would plunge the fork into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot. Whatever the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh.
09002015 But even before the fat was burned, the priest’s servant would come and say to the person who was sacrificing, “Give the priest some meat to roast; he won’t accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.”
09002016 If the person said to him, “Let the fat be burned first, and then take whatever you want,” the servant would answer, “No, hand it over now; if you don’t, I’ll take it by force.”
09002017 This sin of the young men was very great in the Lord’s sight, for they were treating the Lord’s offering with contempt.
09002018 But Samuel was ministering before the Lord—a boy wearing a linen ephod.
09002019 Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.
09002020 Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, “May the Lord give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to the Lord.” Then they would go home.
09002021 And the Lord was gracious to Hannah; she gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the Lord.
09002022 Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
09002023 So he said to them, “Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours.
09002024 No, my sons; the report I hear spreading among the Lord’s people is not good.
09002025 If one person sins against another, God may mediate for the offender; but if anyone sins against the Lord, who will intercede for them?” His sons, however, did not listen to their father’s rebuke, for it was the Lord’s will to put them to death.
09002026 And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the Lord and with people.
09002027 Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Did I not clearly reveal myself to your ancestor’s family when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh?
09002028 I chose your ancestor out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your ancestor’s family all the food offerings presented by the Israelites.
09002029 Why do you scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?’
09002030 “Therefore the Lord, the God of Israel, declares: ‘I promised that members of your family would minister before me forever.’ But now the Lord declares: ‘Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained.
09002031 The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your priestly house, so that no one in it will reach old age,
09002032 and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, no one in your family line will ever reach old age.
09002033 Every one of you that I do not cut off from serving at my altar I will spare only to destroy your sight and sap your strength, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life.
09002034 “ ‘And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you—they will both die on the same day.
09002035 I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in my heart and mind. I will firmly establish his priestly house, and they will minister before my anointed one always.
09002036 Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread and plead, “Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat.” ’ ”
09003001 The boy Samuel ministered before the Lord under Eli. In those days the word of the Lord was rare; there were not many visions.
09003002 One night Eli, whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see, was lying down in his usual place.
09003003 The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the house of the Lord, where the ark of God was.
09003004 Then the Lord called Samuel. Samuel answered, “Here I am.”
09003005 And he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.” But Eli said, “I did not call; go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down.
09003006 Again the Lord called, “Samuel!” And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.” “My son,” Eli said, “I did not call; go back and lie down.”
09003007 Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord: The word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him.
09003008 A third time the Lord called, “Samuel!” And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.” Then Eli realized that the Lord was calling the boy.
09003009 So Eli told Samuel, “Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, ‘Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
09003010 The Lord came and stood there, calling as at the other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” Then Samuel said, “Speak, for your servant is listening.”
09003011 And the Lord said to Samuel: “See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears about it tingle.
09003012 At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his family—from beginning to end.
09003013 For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons blasphemed God, and he failed to restrain them.
09003014 Therefore I swore to the house of Eli, ‘The guilt of Eli’s house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.’ ”
09003015 Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the Lord. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision,
09003016 but Eli called him and said, “Samuel, my son.” Samuel answered, “Here I am.”
09003017 “What was it he said to you?” Eli asked. “Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you.”
09003018 So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said, “He is the Lord; let him do what is good in his eyes.”
09003019 The Lord was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of Samuel’s words fall to the ground.
09003020 And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of the Lord.
09003021 The Lord continued to appear at Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word.
09004001 And Samuel’s word came to all Israel. Now the Israelites went out to fight against the Philistines. The Israelites camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines at Aphek.
09004002 The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield.
09004003 When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why did the Lord bring defeat on us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the Lord’s covenant from Shiloh, so that he may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies.”
09004004 So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the Lord Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim. And Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
09004005 When the ark of the Lord’s covenant came into the camp, all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook.
09004006 Hearing the uproar, the Philistines asked, “What’s all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?” When they learned that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp,
09004007 the Philistines were afraid. “A god has come into the camp,” they said. “Oh no! Nothing like this has happened before.
09004008 We’re doomed! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? They are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.
09004009 Be strong, Philistines! Be men, or you will be subject to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Be men, and fight!”
09004010 So the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were defeated and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great; Israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers.
09004011 The ark of God was captured, and Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
09004012 That same day a Benjamite ran from the battle line and went to Shiloh with his clothes torn and dust on his head.
09004013 When he arrived, there was Eli sitting on his chair by the side of the road, watching, because his heart feared for the ark of God. When the man entered the town and told what had happened, the whole town sent up a cry.
09004014 Eli heard the outcry and asked, “What is the meaning of this uproar?” The man hurried over to Eli,
09004015 who was ninety-eight years old and whose eyes had failed so that he could not see.
09004016 He told Eli, “I have just come from the battle line; I fled from it this very day.” Eli asked, “What happened, my son?”
09004017 The man who brought the news replied, “Israel fled before the Philistines, and the army has suffered heavy losses. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.”
09004018 When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off his chair by the side of the gate. His neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man, and he was heavy. He had led Israel forty years.
09004019 His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and near the time of delivery. When she heard the news that the ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor and gave birth, but was overcome by her labor pains.
09004020 As she was dying, the women attending her said, “Don’t despair; you have given birth to a son.” But she did not respond or pay any attention.
09004021 She named the boy Ichabod, saying, “The Glory has departed from Israel”—because of the capture of the ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband.
09004022 She said, “The Glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.”
09005001 After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
09005002 Then they carried the ark into Dagon’s temple and set it beside Dagon.
09005003 When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord! They took Dagon and put him back in his place.
09005004 But the following morning when they rose, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord! His head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold; only his body remained.
09005005 That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any others who enter Dagon’s temple at Ashdod step on the threshold.
09005006 The Lord’s hand was heavy on the people of Ashdod and its vicinity; he brought devastation on them and afflicted them with tumors.
09005007 When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us, because his hand is heavy on us and on Dagon our god.”
09005008 So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked them, “What shall we do with the ark of the god of Israel?” They answered, “Have the ark of the god of Israel moved to Gath.” So they moved the ark of the God of Israel.
09005009 But after they had moved it, the Lord’s hand was against that city, throwing it into a great panic. He afflicted the people of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors.
09005010 So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. As the ark of God was entering Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, “They have brought the ark of the god of Israel around to us to kill us and our people.”
09005011 So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and said, “Send the ark of the god of Israel away; let it go back to its own place, or it will kill us and our people.” For death had filled the city with panic; God’s hand was very heavy on it.
09005012 Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven.
09006001 When the ark of the Lord had been in Philistine territory seven months,
09006002 the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the Lord? Tell us how we should send it back to its place.”
09006003 They answered, “If you return the ark of the god of Israel, do not send it back to him without a gift; by all means send a guilt offering to him. Then you will be healed, and you will know why his hand has not been lifted from you.”
09006004 The Philistines asked, “What guilt offering should we send to him?” They replied, “Five gold tumors and five gold rats, according to the number of the Philistine rulers, because the same plague has struck both you and your rulers.
09006005 Make models of the tumors and of the rats that are destroying the country, and give glory to Israel’s god. Perhaps he will lift his hand from you and your gods and your land.
09006006 Why do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When Israel’s god dealt harshly with them, did they not send the Israelites out so they could go on their way?
09006007 “Now then, get a new cart ready, with two cows that have calved and have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up.
09006008 Take the ark of the Lord and put it on the cart, and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending back to him as a guilt offering. Send it on its way,
09006009 but keep watching it. If it goes up to its own territory, toward Beth Shemesh, then the Lord has brought this great disaster on us. But if it does not, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us but that it happened to us by chance.”
09006010 So they did this. They took two such cows and hitched them to the cart and penned up their calves.
09006011 They placed the ark of the Lord on the cart and along with it the chest containing the gold rats and the models of the tumors.
09006012 Then the cows went straight up toward Beth Shemesh, keeping on the road and lowing all the way; they did not turn to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh.
09006013 Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they rejoiced at the sight.
09006014 The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and there it stopped beside a large rock. The people chopped up the wood of the cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord.
09006015 The Levites took down the ark of the Lord, together with the chest containing the gold objects, and placed them on the large rock. On that day the people of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the Lord.
09006016 The five rulers of the Philistines saw all this and then returned that same day to Ekron.
09006017 These are the gold tumors the Philistines sent as a guilt offering to the Lord—one each for Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron.
09006018 And the number of the gold rats was according to the number of Philistine towns belonging to the five rulers—the fortified towns with their country villages. The large rock on which the Levites set the ark of the Lord is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.
09006019 But God struck down some of the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, putting seventy of them to death because they looked into the ark of the Lord. The people mourned because of the heavy blow the Lord had dealt them.
09006020 And the people of Beth Shemesh asked, “Who can stand in the presence of the Lord, this holy God? To whom will the ark go up from here?”
09006021 Then they sent messengers to the people of Kiriath Jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of the Lord. Come down and take it up to your town.”
09007001 So the men of Kiriath Jearim came and took up the ark of the Lord. They brought it to Abinadab’s house on the hill and consecrated Eleazar his son to guard the ark of the Lord.
09007002 The ark remained at Kiriath Jearim a long time—twenty years in all. Then all the people of Israel turned back to the Lord.
09007003 So Samuel said to all the Israelites, “If you are returning to the Lord with all your hearts, then rid yourselves of the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths and commit yourselves to the Lord and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.”
09007004 So the Israelites put away their Baals and Ashtoreths, and served the Lord only.
09007005 Then Samuel said, “Assemble all Israel at Mizpah, and I will intercede with the Lord for you.”
09007006 When they had assembled at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the Lord. On that day they fasted and there they confessed, “We have sinned against the Lord.” Now Samuel was serving as leader of Israel at Mizpah.
09007007 When the Philistines heard that Israel had assembled at Mizpah, the rulers of the Philistines came up to attack them. When the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid because of the Philistines.
09007008 They said to Samuel, “Do not stop crying out to the Lord our God for us, that he may rescue us from the hand of the Philistines.”
09007009 Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and sacrificed it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord. He cried out to the Lord on Israel’s behalf, and the Lord answered him.
09007010 While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to engage Israel in battle. But that day the Lord thundered with loud thunder against the Philistines and threw them into such a panic that they were routed before the Israelites.
09007011 The men of Israel rushed out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, slaughtering them along the way to a point below Beth Kar.
09007012 Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, saying, “Thus far the Lord has helped us.”
09007013 So the Philistines were subdued and they stopped invading Israel’s territory. Throughout Samuel’s lifetime, the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines.
09007014 The towns from Ekron to Gath that the Philistines had captured from Israel were restored to Israel, and Israel delivered the neighboring territory from the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
09007015 Samuel continued as Israel’s leader all the days of his life.
09007016 From year to year he went on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah, judging Israel in all those places.
09007017 But he always went back to Ramah, where his home was, and there he also held court for Israel. And he built an altar there to the Lord.
09008001 When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as Israel’s leaders.
09008002 The name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second was Abijah, and they served at Beersheba.
09008003 But his sons did not follow his ways. They turned aside after dishonest gain and accepted bribes and perverted justice.
09008004 So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah.
09008005 They said to him, “You are old, and your sons do not follow your ways; now appoint a king to lead us, such as all the other nations have.”
09008006 But when they said, “Give us a king to lead us,” this displeased Samuel; so he prayed to the Lord.
09008007 And the Lord told him: “Listen to all that the people are saying to you; it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me as their king.
09008008 As they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are doing to you.
09008009 Now listen to them; but warn them solemnly and let them know what the king who will reign over them will claim as his rights.”
09008010 Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people who were asking him for a king.
09008011 He said, “This is what the king who will reign over you will claim as his rights: He will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses, and they will run in front of his chariots.
09008012 Some he will assign to be commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and others to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots.
09008013 He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers.
09008014 He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants.
09008015 He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage and give it to his officials and attendants.
09008016 Your male and female servants and the best of your cattle and donkeys he will take for his own use.
09008017 He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves.
09008018 When that day comes, you will cry out for relief from the king you have chosen, but the Lord will not answer you in that day.”
09008019 But the people refused to listen to Samuel. “No!” they said. “We want a king over us.
09008020 Then we will be like all the other nations, with a king to lead us and to go out before us and fight our battles.”
09008021 When Samuel heard all that the people said, he repeated it before the Lord.
09008022 The Lord answered, “Listen to them and give them a king.” Then Samuel said to the Israelites, “Everyone go back to your own town.”
09009001 There was a Benjamite, a man of standing, whose name was Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bekorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin.
09009002 Kish had a son named Saul, as handsome a young man as could be found anywhere in Israel, and he was a head taller than anyone else.
09009003 Now the donkeys belonging to Saul’s father Kish were lost, and Kish said to his son Saul, “Take one of the servants with you and go and look for the donkeys.”
09009004 So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and through the area around Shalisha, but they did not find them. They went on into the district of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. Then he passed through the territory of Benjamin, but they did not find them.
09009005 When they reached the district of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, “Come, let’s go back, or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us.”
09009006 But the servant replied, “Look, in this town there is a man of God; he is highly respected, and everything he says comes true. Let’s go there now. Perhaps he will tell us what way to take.”
09009007 Saul said to his servant, “If we go, what can we give the man? The food in our sacks is gone. We have no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?”
09009008 The servant answered him again. “Look,” he said, “I have a quarter of a shekel of silver. I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us what way to take.”
09009009 (Formerly in Israel, if someone went to inquire of God, they would say, “Come, let us go to the seer,” because the prophet of today used to be called a seer.)
09009010 “Good,” Saul said to his servant. “Come, let’s go.” So they set out for the town where the man of God was.
09009011 As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to draw water, and they asked them, “Is the seer here?”
09009012 “He is,” they answered. “He’s ahead of you. Hurry now; he has just come to our town today, for the people have a sacrifice at the high place.
09009013 As soon as you enter the town, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not begin eating until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward, those who are invited will eat. Go up now; you should find him about this time.”
09009014 They went up to the town, and as they were entering it, there was Samuel, coming toward them on his way up to the high place.
09009015 Now the day before Saul came, the Lord had revealed this to Samuel:
09009016 “About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him ruler over my people Israel; he will deliver them from the hand of the Philistines. I have looked on my people, for their cry has reached me.”
09009017 When Samuel caught sight of Saul, the Lord said to him, “This is the man I spoke to you about; he will govern my people.”
09009018 Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked, “Would you please tell me where the seer’s house is?”
09009019 “I am the seer,” Samuel replied. “Go up ahead of me to the high place, for today you are to eat with me, and in the morning I will send you on your way and will tell you all that is in your heart.
09009020 As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, do not worry about them; they have been found. And to whom is all the desire of Israel turned, if not to you and your whole family line?”
09009021 Saul answered, “But am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe of Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why do you say such a thing to me?”
09009022 Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and seated them at the head of those who were invited—about thirty in number.
09009023 Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the piece of meat I gave you, the one I told you to lay aside.”
09009024 So the cook took up the thigh with what was on it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel said, “Here is what has been kept for you. Eat, because it was set aside for you for this occasion from the time I said, ‘I have invited guests.’ ” And Saul dined with Samuel that day.
09009025 After they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of his house.
09009026 They rose about daybreak, and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get ready, and I will send you on your way.” When Saul got ready, he and Samuel went outside together.
09009027 As they were going down to the edge of the town, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us”—and the servant did so—“but you stay here for a while, so that I may give you a message from God.”
09010001 Then Samuel took a flask of olive oil and poured it on Saul’s head and kissed him, saying, “Has not the Lord anointed you ruler over his inheritance?
09010002 When you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel’s tomb, at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin. They will say to you, ‘The donkeys you set out to look for have been found. And now your father has stopped thinking about them and is worried about you. He is asking, “What shall I do about my son?” ’
09010003 “Then you will go on from there until you reach the great tree of Tabor. Three men going up to worship God at Bethel will meet you there. One will be carrying three young goats, another three loaves of bread, and another a skin of wine.
09010004 They will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from them.
09010005 “After that you will go to Gibeah of God, where there is a Philistine outpost. As you approach the town, you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place with lyres, timbrels, pipes and harps being played before them, and they will be prophesying.
09010006 The Spirit of the Lord will come powerfully upon you, and you will prophesy with them; and you will be changed into a different person.
09010007 Once these signs are fulfilled, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God is with you.
09010008 “Go down ahead of me to Gilgal. I will surely come down to you to sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, but you must wait seven days until I come to you and tell you what you are to do.”
09010009 As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed Saul’s heart, and all these signs were fulfilled that day.
09010010 When he and his servant arrived at Gibeah, a procession of prophets met him; the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him, and he joined in their prophesying.
09010011 When all those who had formerly known him saw him prophesying with the prophets, they asked each other, “What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”
09010012 A man who lived there answered, “And who is their father?” So it became a saying: “Is Saul also among the prophets?”
09010013 After Saul stopped prophesying, he went to the high place.
09010014 Now Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where have you been?” “Looking for the donkeys,” he said. “But when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.”
09010015 Saul’s uncle said, “Tell me what Samuel said to you.”
09010016 Saul replied, “He assured us that the donkeys had been found.” But he did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship.
09010017 Samuel summoned the people of Israel to the Lord at Mizpah
09010018 and said to them, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the power of Egypt and all the kingdoms that oppressed you.’
09010019 But you have now rejected your God, who saves you out of all your disasters and calamities. And you have said, ‘No, appoint a king over us.’ So now present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and clans.”
09010020 When Samuel had all Israel come forward by tribes, the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot.
09010021 Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan, and Matri’s clan was taken. Finally Saul son of Kish was taken. But when they looked for him, he was not to be found.
09010022 So they inquired further of the Lord, “Has the man come here yet?” And the Lord said, “Yes, he has hidden himself among the supplies.”
09010023 They ran and brought him out, and as he stood among the people he was a head taller than any of the others.
09010024 Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see the man the Lord has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people.” Then the people shouted, “Long live the king!”
09010025 Samuel explained to the people the rights and duties of kingship. He wrote them down on a scroll and deposited it before the Lord. Then Samuel dismissed the people to go to their own homes.
09010026 Saul also went to his home in Gibeah, accompanied by valiant men whose hearts God had touched.
09010027 But some scoundrels said, “How can this fellow save us?” They despised him and brought him no gifts. But Saul kept silent.
09011001 Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh Gilead. And all the men of Jabesh said to him, “Make a treaty with us, and we will be subject to you.”
09011002 But Nahash the Ammonite replied, “I will make a treaty with you only on the condition that I gouge out the right eye of every one of you and so bring disgrace on all Israel.”
09011003 The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days so we can send messengers throughout Israel; if no one comes to rescue us, we will surrender to you.”
09011004 When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and reported these terms to the people, they all wept aloud.
09011005 Just then Saul was returning from the fields, behind his oxen, and he asked, “What is wrong with everyone? Why are they weeping?” Then they repeated to him what the men of Jabesh had said.
09011006 When Saul heard their words, the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him, and he burned with anger.
09011007 He took a pair of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent the pieces by messengers throughout Israel, proclaiming, “This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not follow Saul and Samuel.” Then the terror of the Lord fell on the people, and they came out together as one.
09011008 When Saul mustered them at Bezek, the men of Israel numbered three hundred thousand and those of Judah thirty thousand.
09011009 They told the messengers who had come, “Say to the men of Jabesh Gilead, ‘By the time the sun is hot tomorrow, you will be rescued.’ ” When the messengers went and reported this to the men of Jabesh, they were elated.
09011010 They said to the Ammonites, “Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you can do to us whatever you like.”
09011011 The next day Saul separated his men into three divisions; during the last watch of the night they broke into the camp of the Ammonites and slaughtered them until the heat of the day. Those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.
09011012 The people then said to Samuel, “Who was it that asked, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Turn these men over to us so that we may put them to death.”
09011013 But Saul said, “No one will be put to death today, for this day the Lord has rescued Israel.”
09011014 Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal and there renew the kingship.”
09011015 So all the people went to Gilgal and made Saul king in the presence of the Lord. There they sacrificed fellowship offerings before the Lord, and Saul and all the Israelites held a great celebration.
09012001 Samuel said to all Israel, “I have listened to everything you said to me and have set a king over you.
09012002 Now you have a king as your leader. As for me, I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you. I have been your leader from my youth until this day.
09012003 Here I stand. Testify against me in the presence of the Lord and his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I cheated? Whom have I oppressed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe to make me shut my eyes? If I have done any of these things, I will make it right.”
09012004 “You have not cheated or oppressed us,” they replied. “You have not taken anything from anyone’s hand.”
09012005 Samuel said to them, “The Lord is witness against you, and also his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.” “He is witness,” they said.
09012006 Then Samuel said to the people, “It is the Lord who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your ancestors up out of Egypt.
09012007 Now then, stand here, because I am going to confront you with evidence before the Lord as to all the righteous acts performed by the Lord for you and your ancestors.
09012008 “After Jacob entered Egypt, they cried to the Lord for help, and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your ancestors out of Egypt and settled them in this place.
09012009 “But they forgot the Lord their God; so he sold them into the hand of Sisera, the commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hands of the Philistines and the king of Moab, who fought against them.
09012010 They cried out to the Lord and said, ‘We have sinned; we have forsaken the Lord and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths. But now deliver us from the hands of our enemies, and we will serve you.’
09012011 Then the Lord sent Jerub-Baal, Barak, Jephthah and Samuel, and he delivered you from the hands of your enemies all around you, so that you lived in safety.
09012012 “But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites was moving against you, you said to me, ‘No, we want a king to rule over us’—even though the Lord your God was your king.
09012013 Now here is the king you have chosen, the one you asked for; see, the Lord has set a king over you.
09012014 If you fear the Lord and serve and obey him and do not rebel against his commands, and if both you and the king who reigns over you follow the Lord your God—good!
09012015 But if you do not obey the Lord, and if you rebel against his commands, his hand will be against you, as it was against your ancestors.
09012016 “Now then, stand still and see this great thing the Lord is about to do before your eyes!
09012017 Is it not wheat harvest now? I will call on the Lord to send thunder and rain. And you will realize what an evil thing you did in the eyes of the Lord when you asked for a king.”
09012018 Then Samuel called on the Lord, and that same day the Lord sent thunder and rain. So all the people stood in awe of the Lord and of Samuel.
09012019 The people all said to Samuel, “Pray to the Lord your God for your servants so that we will not die, for we have added to all our other sins the evil of asking for a king.”
09012020 “Do not be afraid,” Samuel replied. “You have done all this evil; yet do not turn away from the Lord, but serve the Lord with all your heart.
09012021 Do not turn away after useless idols. They can do you no good, nor can they rescue you, because they are useless.
09012022 For the sake of his great name the Lord will not reject his people, because the Lord was pleased to make you his own.
09012023 As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by failing to pray for you. And I will teach you the way that is good and right.
09012024 But be sure to fear the Lord and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you.
09012025 Yet if you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will perish.”
09013001 Saul was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned over Israel forty- two years.
09013002 Saul chose three thousand men from Israel; two thousand were with him at Mikmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. The rest of the men he sent back to their homes.
09013003 Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul had the trumpet blown throughout the land and said, “Let the Hebrews hear!”
09013004 So all Israel heard the news: “Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel has become obnoxious to the Philistines.” And the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.
09013005 The Philistines assembled to fight Israel, with three thousand chariots, six thousand charioteers, and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Mikmash, east of Beth Aven.
09013006 When the Israelites saw that their situation was critical and that their army was hard pressed, they hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in pits and cisterns.
09013007 Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul remained at Gilgal, and all the troops with him were quaking with fear.
09013008 He waited seven days, the time set by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and Saul’s men began to scatter.
09013009 So he said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings.” And Saul offered up the burnt offering.
09013010 Just as he finished making the offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him.
09013011 “What have you done?” asked Samuel. Saul replied, “When I saw that the men were scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Mikmash,
09013012 I thought, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the Lord’s favor.’ So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.”
09013013 “You have done a foolish thing,” Samuel said. “You have not kept the command the Lord your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time.
09013014 But now your kingdom will not endure; the Lord has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him ruler of his people, because you have not kept the Lord’s command.”
09013015 Then Samuel left Gilgal and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin, and Saul counted the men who were with him. They numbered about six hundred.
09013016 Saul and his son Jonathan and the men with them were staying in Gibeah in Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Mikmash.
09013017 Raiding parties went out from the Philistine camp in three detachments. One turned toward Ophrah in the vicinity of Shual,
09013018 another toward Beth Horon, and the third toward the borderland overlooking the Valley of Zeboyim facing the wilderness.
09013019 Not a blacksmith could be found in the whole land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, “Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!”
09013020 So all Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plow points, mattocks, axes and sickles sharpened.
09013021 The price was two-thirds of a shekel for sharpening plow points and mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening forks and axes and for repointing goads.
09013022 So on the day of the battle not a soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear in his hand; only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.
09013023 Now a detachment of Philistines had gone out to the pass at Mikmash.
09014001 One day Jonathan son of Saul said to his young armor-bearer, “Come, let’s go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side.” But he did not tell his father.
09014002 Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron. With him were about six hundred men,
09014003 among whom was Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod. He was a son of Ichabod’s brother Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the Lord’s priest in Shiloh. No one was aware that Jonathan had left.
09014004 On each side of the pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost was a cliff; one was called Bozez and the other Seneh.
09014005 One cliff stood to the north toward Mikmash, the other to the south toward Geba.
09014006 Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer, “Come, let’s go over to the outpost of those uncircumcised men. Perhaps the Lord will act in our behalf. Nothing can hinder the Lord from saving, whether by many or by few.”
09014007 “Do all that you have in mind,” his armor-bearer said. “Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul.”
09014008 Jonathan said, “Come on, then; we will cross over toward them and let them see us.
09014009 If they say to us, ‘Wait there until we come to you,’ we will stay where we are and not go up to them.
09014010 But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ we will climb up, because that will be our sign that the Lord has given them into our hands.”
09014011 So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. “Look!” said the Philistines. “The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in.”
09014012 The men of the outpost shouted to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, “Come up to us and we’ll teach you a lesson.” So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Climb up after me; the Lord has given them into the hand of Israel.”
09014013 Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and killed behind him.
09014014 In that first attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed some twenty men in an area of about half an acre.
09014015 Then panic struck the whole army—those in the camp and field, and those in the outposts and raiding parties—and the ground shook. It was a panic sent by God.
09014016 Saul’s lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions.
09014017 Then Saul said to the men who were with him, “Muster the forces and see who has left us.” When they did, it was Jonathan and his armor-bearer who were not there.
09014018 Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God.” (At that time it was with the Israelites.)
09014019 While Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the Philistine camp increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”
09014020 Then Saul and all his men assembled and went to the battle. They found the Philistines in total confusion, striking each other with their swords.
09014021 Those Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone up with them to their camp went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
09014022 When all the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were on the run, they joined the battle in hot pursuit.
09014023 So on that day the Lord saved Israel, and the battle moved on beyond Beth Aven.
09014024 Now the Israelites were in distress that day, because Saul had bound the people under an oath, saying, “Cursed be anyone who eats food before evening comes, before I have avenged myself on my enemies!” So none of the troops tasted food.
09014025 The entire army entered the woods, and there was honey on the ground.
09014026 When they went into the woods, they saw the honey oozing out; yet no one put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath.
09014027 But Jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath, so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb. He raised his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened.
09014028 Then one of the soldiers told him, “Your father bound the army under a strict oath, saying, ‘Cursed be anyone who eats food today!’ That is why the men are faint.”
09014029 Jonathan said, “My father has made trouble for the country. See how my eyes brightened when I tasted a little of this honey.
09014030 How much better it would have been if the men had eaten today some of the plunder they took from their enemies. Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?”
09014031 That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Mikmash to Aijalon, they were exhausted.
09014032 They pounced on the plunder and, taking sheep, cattle and calves, they butchered them on the ground and ate them, together with the blood.
09014033 Then someone said to Saul, “Look, the men are sinning against the Lord by eating meat that has blood in it.” “You have broken faith,” he said. “Roll a large stone over here at once.”
09014034 Then he said, “Go out among the men and tell them, ‘Each of you bring me your cattle and sheep, and slaughter them here and eat them. Do not sin against the Lord by eating meat with blood still in it.’ ” So everyone brought his ox that night and slaughtered it there.
09014035 Then Saul built an altar to the Lord; it was the first time he had done this.
09014036 Saul said, “Let us go down and pursue the Philistines by night and plunder them till dawn, and let us not leave one of them alive.” “Do whatever seems best to you,” they replied. But the priest said, “Let us inquire of God here.”
09014037 So Saul asked God, “Shall I go down and pursue the Philistines? Will you give them into Israel’s hand?” But God did not answer him that day.
09014038 Saul therefore said, “Come here, all you who are leaders of the army, and let us find out what sin has been committed today.
09014039 As surely as the Lord who rescues Israel lives, even if the guilt lies with my son Jonathan, he must die.” But not one of them said a word.
09014040 Saul then said to all the Israelites, “You stand over there; I and Jonathan my son will stand over here.” “Do what seems best to you,” they replied.
09014041 Then Saul prayed to the Lord, the God of Israel, “Why have you not answered your servant today? If the fault is in me or my son Jonathan, respond with Urim, but if the men of Israel are at fault, respond with Thummim.” Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, and the men were cleared.
09014042 Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son.” And Jonathan was taken.
09014043 Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” So Jonathan told him, “I tasted a little honey with the end of my staff. And now I must die!”
09014044 Saul said, “May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you do not die, Jonathan.”
09014045 But the men said to Saul, “Should Jonathan die—he who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel? Never! As surely as the Lord lives, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he did this today with God’s help.” So the men rescued Jonathan, and he was not put to death.
09014046 Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they withdrew to their own land.
09014047 After Saul had assumed rule over Israel, he fought against their enemies on every side: Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment on them.
09014048 He fought valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of those who had plundered them.
09014049 Saul’s sons were Jonathan, Ishvi and Malki-Shua. The name of his older daughter was Merab, and that of the younger was Michal.
09014050 His wife’s name was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of Saul’s army was Abner son of Ner, and Ner was Saul’s uncle.
09014051 Saul’s father Kish and Abner’s father Ner were sons of Abiel.
09014052 All the days of Saul there was bitter war with the Philistines, and whenever Saul saw a mighty or brave man, he took him into his service.
09015001 Samuel said to Saul, “I am the one the Lord sent to anoint you king over his people Israel; so listen now to the message from the Lord.
09015002 This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt.
09015003 Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.’ ”
09015004 So Saul summoned the men and mustered them at Telaim—two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand from Judah.
09015005 Saul went to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the ravine.
09015006 Then he said to the Kenites, “Go away, leave the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you along with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.
09015007 Then Saul attacked the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt.
09015008 He took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and all his people he totally destroyed with the sword.
09015009 But Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves and lambs—everything that was good. These they were unwilling to destroy completely, but everything that was despised and weak they totally destroyed.
09015010 Then the word of the Lord came to Samuel:
09015011 “I regret that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions.” Samuel was angry, and he cried out to the Lord all that night.
09015012 Early in the morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul, but he was told, “Saul has gone to Carmel. There he has set up a monument in his own honor and has turned and gone on down to Gilgal.”
09015013 When Samuel reached him, Saul said, “The Lord bless you! I have carried out the Lord’s instructions.”
09015014 But Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears? What is this lowing of cattle that I hear?”
09015015 Saul answered, “The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the Lord your God, but we totally destroyed the rest.”
09015016 “Enough!” Samuel said to Saul. “Let me tell you what the Lord said to me last night.” “Tell me,” Saul replied.
09015017 Samuel said, “Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The Lord anointed you king over Israel.
09015018 And he sent you on a mission, saying, ‘Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; wage war against them until you have wiped them out.’
09015019 Why did you not obey the Lord? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the Lord?”
09015020 “But I did obey the Lord,” Saul said. “I went on the mission the Lord assigned me. I completely destroyed the Amalekites and brought back Agag their king.
09015021 The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of what was devoted to God, in order to sacrifice them to the Lord your God at Gilgal.”
09015022 But Samuel replied: “Does the Lord delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the Lord? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams.
09015023 For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, he has rejected you as king.”
09015024 Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned. I violated the Lord’s command and your instructions. I was afraid of the men and so I gave in to them.
09015025 Now I beg you, forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I may worship the Lord.”
09015026 But Samuel said to him, “I will not go back with you. You have rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord has rejected you as king over Israel!”
09015027 As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore.
09015028 Samuel said to him, “The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors—to one better than you.
09015029 He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a human being, that he should change his mind.”
09015030 Saul replied, “I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel; come back with me, so that I may worship the Lord your God.”
09015031 So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the Lord.
09015032 Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites.” Agag came to him in chains. And he thought, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.”
09015033 But Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so will your mother be childless among women.” And Samuel put Agag to death before the Lord at Gilgal.
09015034 Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul.
09015035 Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for him. And the Lord regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel.
09016001 The Lord said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and be on your way; I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem. I have chosen one of his sons to be king.”
09016002 But Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears about it, he will kill me.” The Lord said, “Take a heifer with you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.’
09016003 Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do. You are to anoint for me the one I indicate.”
09016004 Samuel did what the Lord said. When he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders of the town trembled when they met him. They asked, “Do you come in peace?”
09016005 Samuel replied, “Yes, in peace; I have come to sacrifice to the Lord. Consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me.” Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.
09016006 When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, “Surely the Lord’s anointed stands here before the Lord.”
09016007 But the Lord said to Samuel, “Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.”
09016008 Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, “The Lord has not chosen this one either.”
09016009 Jesse then had Shammah pass by, but Samuel said, “Nor has the Lord chosen this one.”
09016010 Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to him, “The Lord has not chosen these.”
09016011 So he asked Jesse, “Are these all the sons you have?” “There is still the youngest,” Jesse answered. “He is tending the sheep.” Samuel said, “Send for him; we will not sit down until he arrives.”
09016012 So he sent for him and had him brought in. He was glowing with health and had a fine appearance and handsome features. Then the Lord said, “Rise and anoint him; this is the one.”
09016013 So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon David. Samuel then went to Ramah.
09016014 Now the Spirit of the Lord had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord tormented him.
09016015 Saul’s attendants said to him, “See, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you.
09016016 Let our lord command his servants here to search for someone who can play the lyre. He will play when the evil spirit from God comes on you, and you will feel better.”
09016017 So Saul said to his attendants, “Find someone who plays well and bring him to me.”
09016018 One of the servants answered, “I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the lyre. He is a brave man and a warrior. He speaks well and is a fine-looking man. And the Lord is with him.”
09016019 Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me your son David, who is with the sheep.”
09016020 So Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them with his son David to Saul.
09016021 David came to Saul and entered his service. Saul liked him very much, and David became one of his armor-bearers.
09016022 Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, “Allow David to remain in my service, for I am pleased with him.”
09016023 Whenever the spirit from God came on Saul, David would take up his lyre and play. Then relief would come to Saul; he would feel better, and the evil spirit would leave him.
09017001 Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war and assembled at Sokoh in Judah. They pitched camp at Ephes Dammim, between Sokoh and Azekah.
09017002 Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah and drew up their battle line to meet the Philistines.
09017003 The Philistines occupied one hill and the Israelites another, with the valley between them.
09017004 A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. His height was six cubits and a span.
09017005 He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels ;
09017006 on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back.
09017007 His spear shaft was like a weaver’s rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. His shield bearer went ahead of him.
09017008 Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me.
09017009 If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us.”
09017010 Then the Philistine said, “This day I defy the armies of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other.”
09017011 On hearing the Philistine’s words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified.
09017012 Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse, who was from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and in Saul’s time he was very old.
09017013 Jesse’s three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war: The firstborn was Eliab; the second, Abinadab; and the third, Shammah.
09017014 David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul,
09017015 but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.
09017016 For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand.
09017017 Now Jesse said to his son David, “Take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp.
09017018 Take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit. See how your brothers are and bring back some assurance from them.
09017019 They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.”
09017020 Early in the morning David left the flock in the care of a shepherd, loaded up and set out, as Jesse had directed. He reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions, shouting the war cry.
09017021 Israel and the Philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other.
09017022 David left his things with the keeper of supplies, ran to the battle lines and asked his brothers how they were.
09017023 As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it.
09017024 Whenever the Israelites saw the man, they all fled from him in great fear.
09017025 Now the Israelites had been saying, “Do you see how this man keeps coming out? He comes out to defy Israel. The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his family from taxes in Israel.”
09017026 David asked the men standing near him, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?”
09017027 They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him, “This is what will be done for the man who kills him.”
09017028 When Eliab, David’s oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he burned with anger at him and asked, “Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is; you came down only to watch the battle.”
09017029 “Now what have I done?” said David. “Can’t I even speak?”
09017030 He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter, and the men answered him as before.
09017031 What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, and Saul sent for him.
09017032 David said to Saul, “Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him.”
09017033 Saul replied, “You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a young man, and he has been a warrior from his youth.”
09017034 But David said to Saul, “Your servant has been keeping his father’s sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock,
09017035 I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it.
09017036 Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God.
09017037 The Lord who rescued me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine.” Saul said to David, “Go, and the Lord be with you.”
09017038 Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic. He put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head.
09017039 David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around, because he was not used to them. “I cannot go in these,” he said to Saul, “because I am not used to them.” So he took them off.
09017040 Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine.
09017041 Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer in front of him, kept coming closer to David.
09017042 He looked David over and saw that he was little more than a boy, glowing with health and handsome, and he despised him.
09017043 He said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
09017044 “Come here,” he said, “and I’ll give your flesh to the birds and the wild animals!”
09017045 David said to the Philistine, “You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
09017046 This day the Lord will deliver you into my hands, and I’ll strike you down and cut off your head. This very day I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds and the wild animals, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel.
09017047 All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the Lord saves; for the battle is the Lord’s, and he will give all of you into our hands.”
09017048 As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him.
09017049 Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground.
09017050 So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him.
09017051 David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine’s sword and drew it from the sheath. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran.
09017052 Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath and to the gates of Ekron. Their dead were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron.
09017053 When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines, they plundered their camp.
09017054 David took the Philistine’s head and brought it to Jerusalem; he put the Philistine’s weapons in his own tent.
09017055 As Saul watched David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is that young man?” Abner replied, “As surely as you live, Your Majesty, I don’t know.”
09017056 The king said, “Find out whose son this young man is.”
09017057 As soon as David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with David still holding the Philistine’s head.
09017058 “Whose son are you, young man?” Saul asked him. David said, “I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem.”
09018001 After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself.
09018002 From that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return home to his family.
09018003 And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself.
09018004 Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even his sword, his bow and his belt.
09018005 Whatever mission Saul sent him on, David was so successful that Saul gave him a high rank in the army. This pleased all the troops, and Saul’s officers as well.
09018006 When the men were returning home after David had killed the Philistine, the women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs and with timbrels and lyres.
09018007 As they danced, they sang: “Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands.”
09018008 Saul was very angry; this refrain displeased him greatly. “They have credited David with tens of thousands,” he thought, “but me with only thousands. What more can he get but the kingdom?”
09018009 And from that time on Saul kept a close eye on David.
09018010 The next day an evil spirit from God came forcefully on Saul. He was prophesying in his house, while David was playing the lyre, as he usually did. Saul had a spear in his hand
09018011 and he hurled it, saying to himself, “I’ll pin David to the wall.” But David eluded him twice.
09018012 Saul was afraid of David, because the Lord was with David but had departed from Saul.
09018013 So he sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men, and David led the troops in their campaigns.
09018014 In everything he did he had great success, because the Lord was with him.
09018015 When Saul saw how successful he was, he was afraid of him.
09018016 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in their campaigns.
09018017 Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you in marriage; only serve me bravely and fight the battles of the Lord.” For Saul said to himself, “I will not raise a hand against him. Let the Philistines do that!”
09018018 But David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my family or my clan in Israel, that I should become the king’s son-in-law?”
09018019 So when the time came for Merab, Saul’s daughter, to be given to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah.
09018020 Now Saul’s daughter Michal was in love with David, and when they told Saul about it, he was pleased.
09018021 “I will give her to him,” he thought, “so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” So Saul said to David, “Now you have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law.”
09018022 Then Saul ordered his attendants: “Speak to David privately and say, ‘Look, the king likes you, and his attendants all love you; now become his son-in-law.’ ”
09018023 They repeated these words to David. But David said, “Do you think it is a small matter to become the king’s son-in-law? I’m only a poor man and little known.”
09018024 When Saul’s servants told him what David had said,
09018025 Saul replied, “Say to David, ‘The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.’ ” Saul’s plan was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines.
09018026 When the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become the king’s son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed,
09018027 David took his men with him and went out and killed two hundred Philistines and brought back their foreskins. They counted out the full number to the king so that David might become the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage.
09018028 When Saul realized that the Lord was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David,
09018029 Saul became still more afraid of him, and he remained his enemy the rest of his days.
09018030 The Philistine commanders continued to go out to battle, and as often as they did, David met with more success than the rest of Saul’s officers, and his name became well known.
09019001 Saul told his son Jonathan and all the attendants to kill David. But Jonathan had taken a great liking to David
09019002 and warned him, “My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Be on your guard tomorrow morning; go into hiding and stay there.
09019003 I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are. I’ll speak to him about you and will tell you what I find out.”
09019004 Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, “Let not the king do wrong to his servant David; he has not wronged you, and what he has done has benefited you greatly.
09019005 He took his life in his hands when he killed the Philistine. The Lord won a great victory for all Israel, and you saw it and were glad. Why then would you do wrong to an innocent man like David by killing him for no reason?”
09019006 Saul listened to Jonathan and took this oath: “As surely as the Lord lives, David will not be put to death.”
09019007 So Jonathan called David and told him the whole conversation. He brought him to Saul, and David was with Saul as before.
09019008 Once more war broke out, and David went out and fought the Philistines. He struck them with such force that they fled before him.
09019009 But an evil spirit from the Lord came on Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand. While David was playing the lyre,
09019010 Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear, but David eluded him as Saul drove the spear into the wall. That night David made good his escape.
09019011 Saul sent men to David’s house to watch it and to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David’s wife, warned him, “If you don’t run for your life tonight, tomorrow you’ll be killed.”
09019012 So Michal let David down through a window, and he fled and escaped.
09019013 Then Michal took an idol and laid it on the bed, covering it with a garment and putting some goats’ hair at the head.
09019014 When Saul sent the men to capture David, Michal said, “He is ill.”
09019015 Then Saul sent the men back to see David and told them, “Bring him up to me in his bed so that I may kill him.”
09019016 But when the men entered, there was the idol in the bed, and at the head was some goats’ hair.
09019017 Saul said to Michal, “Why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy away so that he escaped?” Michal told him, “He said to me, ‘Let me get away. Why should I kill you?’ ”
09019018 When David had fled and made his escape, he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there.
09019019 Word came to Saul: “David is in Naioth at Ramah”;
09019020 so he sent men to capture him. But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing there as their leader, the Spirit of God came on Saul’s men, and they also prophesied.
09019021 Saul was told about it, and he sent more men, and they prophesied too. Saul sent men a third time, and they also prophesied.
09019022 Finally, he himself left for Ramah and went to the great cistern at Seku. And he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” “Over in Naioth at Ramah,” they said.
09019023 So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah. But the Spirit of God came even on him, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth.
09019024 He stripped off his garments, and he too prophesied in Samuel’s presence. He lay naked all that day and all that night. This is why people say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”
09020001 Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, “What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father, that he is trying to kill me?”
09020002 “Never!” Jonathan replied. “You are not going to die! Look, my father doesn’t do anything, great or small, without letting me know. Why would he hide this from me? It isn’t so!”
09020003 But David took an oath and said, “Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself, ‘Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.’ Yet as surely as the Lord lives and as you live, there is only a step between me and death.”
09020004 Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you want me to do, I’ll do for you.”
09020005 So David said, “Look, tomorrow is the New Moon feast, and I am supposed to dine with the king; but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow.
09020006 If your father misses me at all, tell him, ‘David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan.’
09020007 If he says, ‘Very well,’ then your servant is safe. But if he loses his temper, you can be sure that he is determined to harm me.
09020008 As for you, show kindness to your servant, for you have brought him into a covenant with you before the Lord. If I am guilty, then kill me yourself! Why hand me over to your father?”
09020009 “Never!” Jonathan said. “If I had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn’t I tell you?”
09020010 David asked, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?”
09020011 “Come,” Jonathan said, “let’s go out into the field.” So they went there together.
09020012 Then Jonathan said to David, “I swear by the Lord, the God of Israel, that I will surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow! If he is favorably disposed toward you, will I not send you word and let you know?
09020013 But if my father intends to harm you, may the Lord deal with Jonathan, be it ever so severely, if I do not let you know and send you away in peace. May the Lord be with you as he has been with my father.
09020014 But show me unfailing kindness like the Lord’s kindness as long as I live, so that I may not be killed,
09020015 and do not ever cut off your kindness from my family—not even when the Lord has cut off every one of David’s enemies from the face of the earth.”
09020016 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “May the Lord call David’s enemies to account.”
09020017 And Jonathan had David reaffirm his oath out of love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself.
09020018 Then Jonathan said to David, “Tomorrow is the New Moon feast. You will be missed, because your seat will be empty.
09020019 The day after tomorrow, toward evening, go to the place where you hid when this trouble began, and wait by the stone Ezel.
09020020 I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I were shooting at a target.
09020021 Then I will send a boy and say, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I say to him, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them here,’ then come, because, as surely as the Lord lives, you are safe; there is no danger.
09020022 But if I say to the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then you must go, because the Lord has sent you away.
09020023 And about the matter you and I discussed—remember, the Lord is witness between you and me forever.”
09020024 So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon feast came, the king sat down to eat.
09020025 He sat in his customary place by the wall, opposite Jonathan, and Abner sat next to Saul, but David’s place was empty.
09020026 Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, “Something must have happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean—surely he is unclean.”
09020027 But the next day, the second day of the month, David’s place was empty again. Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, “Why hasn’t the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?”
09020028 Jonathan answered, “David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem.
09020029 He said, ‘Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there. If I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away to see my brothers.’ That is why he has not come to the king’s table.”
09020030 Saul’s anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, “You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don’t I know that you have sided with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you?
09020031 As long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send someone to bring him to me, for he must die!”
09020032 “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?” Jonathan asked his father.
09020033 But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David.
09020034 Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day of the feast he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father’s shameful treatment of David.
09020035 In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him,
09020036 and he said to the boy, “Run and find the arrows I shoot.” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
09020037 When the boy came to the place where Jonathan’s arrow had fallen, Jonathan called out after him, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?”
09020038 Then he shouted, “Hurry! Go quickly! Don’t stop!” The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master.
09020039 (The boy knew nothing about all this; only Jonathan and David knew.)
09020040 Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said, “Go, carry them back to town.”
09020041 After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together—but David wept the most.
09020042 Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the Lord, saying, ‘The Lord is witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants forever.’ ” Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the town.
09021001 David went to Nob, to Ahimelek the priest. Ahimelek trembled when he met him, and asked, “Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?”
09021002 David answered Ahimelek the priest, “The king sent me on a mission and said to me, ‘No one is to know anything about the mission I am sending you on.’ As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place.
09021003 Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you can find.”
09021004 But the priest answered David, “I don’t have any ordinary bread on hand; however, there is some consecrated bread here—provided the men have kept themselves from women.”
09021005 David replied, “Indeed women have been kept from us, as usual whenever I set out. The men’s bodies are holy even on missions that are not holy. How much more so today!”
09021006 So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the Lord and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away.
09021007 Now one of Saul’s servants was there that day, detained before the Lord; he was Doeg the Edomite, Saul’s chief shepherd.
09021008 David asked Ahimelek, “Don’t you have a spear or a sword here? I haven’t brought my sword or any other weapon, because the king’s mission was urgent.”
09021009 The priest replied, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it; there is no sword here but that one.” David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”
09021010 That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath.
09021011 But the servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David, the king of the land? Isn’t he the one they sing about in their dances: “ ‘Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands’?”
09021012 David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath.
09021013 So he pretended to be insane in their presence; and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard.
09021014 Achish said to his servants, “Look at the man! He is insane! Why bring him to me?
09021015 Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?”
09022001 David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his father’s household heard about it, they went down to him there.
09022002 All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their commander. About four hundred men were with him.
09022003 From there David went to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab, “Would you let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God will do for me?”
09022004 So he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him as long as David was in the stronghold.
09022005 But the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold. Go into the land of Judah.” So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.
09022006 Now Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. And Saul was seated, spear in hand, under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, with all his officials standing at his side.
09022007 He said to them, “Listen, men of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?
09022008 Is that why you have all conspired against me? No one tells me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is concerned about me or tells me that my son has incited my servant to lie in wait for me, as he does today.”
09022009 But Doeg the Edomite, who was standing with Saul’s officials, said, “I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelek son of Ahitub at Nob.
09022010 Ahimelek inquired of the Lord for him; he also gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”
09022011 Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelek son of Ahitub and all the men of his family, who were the priests at Nob, and they all came to the king.
09022012 Saul said, “Listen now, son of Ahitub.” “Yes, my lord,” he answered.
09022013 Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of God for him, so that he has rebelled against me and lies in wait for me, as he does today?”
09022014 Ahimelek answered the king, “Who of all your servants is as loyal as David, the king’s son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard and highly respected in your household?
09022015 Was that day the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king accuse your servant or any of his father’s family, for your servant knows nothing at all about this whole affair.”
09022016 But the king said, “You will surely die, Ahimelek, you and your whole family.”
09022017 Then the king ordered the guards at his side: “Turn and kill the priests of the Lord, because they too have sided with David. They knew he was fleeing, yet they did not tell me.” But the king’s officials were unwilling to raise a hand to strike the priests of the Lord.
09022018 The king then ordered Doeg, “You turn and strike down the priests.” So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck them down. That day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.
09022019 He also put to the sword Nob, the town of the priests, with its men and women, its children and infants, and its cattle, donkeys and sheep.
09022020 But one son of Ahimelek son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled to join David.
09022021 He told David that Saul had killed the priests of the Lord.
09022022 Then David said to Abiathar, “That day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, I knew he would be sure to tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of your whole family.
09022023 Stay with me; don’t be afraid. The man who wants to kill you is trying to kill me too. You will be safe with me.”
09023001 When David was told, “Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are looting the threshing floors,”
09023002 he inquired of the Lord, saying, “Shall I go and attack these Philistines?” The Lord answered him, “Go, attack the Philistines and save Keilah.”
09023003 But David’s men said to him, “Here in Judah we are afraid. How much more, then, if we go to Keilah against the Philistine forces!”
09023004 Once again David inquired of the Lord, and the Lord answered him, “Go down to Keilah, for I am going to give the Philistines into your hand.”
09023005 So David and his men went to Keilah, fought the Philistines and carried off their livestock. He inflicted heavy losses on the Philistines and saved the people of Keilah.
09023006 (Now Abiathar son of Ahimelek had brought the ephod down with him when he fled to David at Keilah.)
09023007 Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, and he said, “God has delivered him into my hands, for David has imprisoned himself by entering a town with gates and bars.”
09023008 And Saul called up all his forces for battle, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men.
09023009 When David learned that Saul was plotting against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod.”
09023010 David said, “Lord, God of Israel, your servant has heard definitely that Saul plans to come to Keilah and destroy the town on account of me.
09023011 Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me to him? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? Lord, God of Israel, tell your servant.” And the Lord said, “He will.”
09023012 Again David asked, “Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men to Saul?” And the Lord said, “They will.”
09023013 So David and his men, about six hundred in number, left Keilah and kept moving from place to place. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he did not go there.
09023014 David stayed in the wilderness strongholds and in the hills of the Desert of Ziph. Day after day Saul searched for him, but God did not give David into his hands.
09023015 While David was at Horesh in the Desert of Ziph, he learned that Saul had come out to take his life.
09023016 And Saul’s son Jonathan went to David at Horesh and helped him find strength in God.
09023017 “Don’t be afraid,” he said. “My father Saul will not lay a hand on you. You will be king over Israel, and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul knows this.”
09023018 The two of them made a covenant before the Lord. Then Jonathan went home, but David remained at Horesh.
09023019 The Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hakilah, south of Jeshimon?
09023020 Now, Your Majesty, come down whenever it pleases you to do so, and we will be responsible for giving him into your hands.”
09023021 Saul replied, “The Lord bless you for your concern for me.
09023022 Go and get more information. Find out where David usually goes and who has seen him there. They tell me he is very crafty.
09023023 Find out about all the hiding places he uses and come back to me with definite information. Then I will go with you; if he is in the area, I will track him down among all the clans of Judah.”
09023024 So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Desert of Maon, in the Arabah south of Jeshimon.
09023025 Saul and his men began the search, and when David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Desert of Maon. When Saul heard this, he went into the Desert of Maon in pursuit of David.
09023026 Saul was going along one side of the mountain, and David and his men were on the other side, hurrying to get away from Saul. As Saul and his forces were closing in on David and his men to capture them,
09023027 a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Come quickly! The Philistines are raiding the land.”
09023028 Then Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines. That is why they call this place Sela Hammahlekoth.
09023029 And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.
09024001 After Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, “David is in the Desert of En Gedi.”
09024002 So Saul took three thousand able young men from all Israel and set out to look for David and his men near the Crags of the Wild Goats.
09024003 He came to the sheep pens along the way; a cave was there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were far back in the cave.
09024004 The men said, “This is the day the Lord spoke of when he said to you, ‘I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.’ ” Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul’s robe.
09024005 Afterward, David was conscience-stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe.
09024006 He said to his men, “The Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the Lord’s anointed, or lay my hand on him; for he is the anointed of the Lord.”
09024007 With these words David sharply rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. And Saul left the cave and went his way.
09024008 Then David went out of the cave and called out to Saul, “My lord the king!” When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.
09024009 He said to Saul, “Why do you listen when men say, ‘David is bent on harming you’?
09024010 This day you have seen with your own eyes how the Lord delivered you into my hands in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you; I said, ‘I will not lay my hand on my lord, because he is the Lord’s anointed.’
09024011 See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you. See that there is nothing in my hand to indicate that I am guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion. I have not wronged you, but you are hunting me down to take my life.
09024012 May the Lord judge between you and me. And may the Lord avenge the wrongs you have done to me, but my hand will not touch you.
09024013 As the old saying goes, ‘From evildoers come evil deeds,’ so my hand will not touch you.
09024014 “Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Who are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea?
09024015 May the Lord be our judge and decide between us. May he consider my cause and uphold it; may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand.”
09024016 When David finished saying this, Saul asked, “Is that your voice, David my son?” And he wept aloud.
09024017 “You are more righteous than I,” he said. “You have treated me well, but I have treated you badly.
09024018 You have just now told me about the good you did to me; the Lord delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me.
09024019 When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the Lord reward you well for the way you treated me today.
09024020 I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands.
09024021 Now swear to me by the Lord that you will not kill off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father’s family.”
09024022 So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
09025001 Now Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned for him; and they buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David moved down into the Desert of Paran.
09025002 A certain man in Maon, who had property there at Carmel, was very wealthy. He had a thousand goats and three thousand sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel.
09025003 His name was Nabal and his wife’s name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful woman, but her husband was surly and mean in his dealings—he was a Calebite.
09025004 While David was in the wilderness, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep.
09025005 So he sent ten young men and said to them, “Go up to Nabal at Carmel and greet him in my name.
09025006 Say to him: ‘Long life to you! Good health to you and your household! And good health to all that is yours!
09025007 “ ‘Now I hear that it is sheep-shearing time. When your shepherds were with us, we did not mistreat them, and the whole time they were at Carmel nothing of theirs was missing.
09025008 Ask your own servants and they will tell you. Therefore be favorable toward my men, since we come at a festive time. Please give your servants and your son David whatever you can find for them.’ ”
09025009 When David’s men arrived, they gave Nabal this message in David’s name. Then they waited.
09025010 Nabal answered David’s servants, “Who is this David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many servants are breaking away from their masters these days.
09025011 Why should I take my bread and water, and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men coming from who knows where?”
09025012 David’s men turned around and went back. When they arrived, they reported every word.
09025013 David said to his men, “Each of you strap on your sword!” So they did, and David strapped his on as well. About four hundred men went up with David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies.
09025014 One of the servants told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, “David sent messengers from the wilderness to give our master his greetings, but he hurled insults at them.
09025015 Yet these men were very good to us. They did not mistreat us, and the whole time we were out in the fields near them nothing was missing.
09025016 Night and day they were a wall around us the whole time we were herding our sheep near them.
09025017 Now think it over and see what you can do, because disaster is hanging over our master and his whole household. He is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him.”
09025018 Abigail acted quickly. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs of roasted grain, a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys.
09025019 Then she told her servants, “Go on ahead; I’ll follow you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
09025020 As she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, there were David and his men descending toward her, and she met them.
09025021 David had just said, “It’s been useless—all my watching over this fellow’s property in the wilderness so that nothing of his was missing. He has paid me back evil for good.
09025022 May God deal with David, be it ever so severely, if by morning I leave alive one male of all who belong to him!”
09025023 When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down before David with her face to the ground.
09025024 She fell at his feet and said: “Pardon your servant, my lord, and let me speak to you; hear what your servant has to say.
09025025 Please pay no attention, my lord, to that wicked man Nabal. He is just like his name—his name means Fool, and folly goes with him. And as for me, your servant, I did not see the men my lord sent.
09025026 And now, my lord, as surely as the Lord your God lives and as you live, since the Lord has kept you from bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hands, may your enemies and all who are intent on harming my lord be like Nabal.
09025027 And let this gift, which your servant has brought to my lord, be given to the men who follow you.
09025028 “Please forgive your servant’s presumption. The Lord your God will certainly make a lasting dynasty for my lord, because you fight the Lord’s battles, and no wrongdoing will be found in you as long as you live.
09025029 Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life, the life of my lord will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the Lord your God, but the lives of your enemies he will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling.
09025030 When the Lord has fulfilled for my lord every good thing he promised concerning him and has appointed him ruler over Israel,
09025031 my lord will not have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed or of having avenged himself. And when the Lord your God has brought my lord success, remember your servant.”
09025032 David said to Abigail, “Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who has sent you today to meet me.
09025033 May you be blessed for your good judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself with my own hands.
09025034 Otherwise, as surely as the Lord, the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, not one male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by daybreak.”
09025035 Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said, “Go home in peace. I have heard your words and granted your request.”
09025036 When Abigail went to Nabal, he was in the house holding a banquet like that of a king. He was in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing at all until daybreak.
09025037 Then in the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him all these things, and his heart failed him and he became like a stone.
09025038 About ten days later, the Lord struck Nabal and he died.
09025039 When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Praise be to the Lord, who has upheld my cause against Nabal for treating me with contempt. He has kept his servant from doing wrong and has brought Nabal’s wrongdoing down on his own head.” Then David sent word to Abigail, asking her to become his wife.
09025040 His servants went to Carmel and said to Abigail, “David has sent us to you to take you to become his wife.”
09025041 She bowed down with her face to the ground and said, “I am your servant and am ready to serve you and wash the feet of my lord’s servants.”
09025042 Abigail quickly got on a donkey and, attended by her five female servants, went with David’s messengers and became his wife.
09025043 David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both were his wives.
09025044 But Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Paltiel son of Laish, who was from Gallim.
09026001 The Ziphites went to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding on the hill of Hakilah, which faces Jeshimon?”
09026002 So Saul went down to the Desert of Ziph, with his three thousand select Israelite troops, to search there for David.
09026003 Saul made his camp beside the road on the hill of Hakilah facing Jeshimon, but David stayed in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul had followed him there,
09026004 he sent out scouts and learned that Saul had definitely arrived.
09026005 Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the commander of the army, had lain down. Saul was lying inside the camp, with the army encamped around him.
09026006 David then asked Ahimelek the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, “Who will go down into the camp with me to Saul?” “I’ll go with you,” said Abishai.
09026007 So David and Abishai went to the army by night, and there was Saul, lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying around him.
09026008 Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of the spear; I won’t strike him twice.”
09026009 But David said to Abishai, “Don’t destroy him! Who can lay a hand on the Lord’s anointed and be guiltless?
09026010 As surely as the Lord lives,” he said, “the Lord himself will strike him, or his time will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish.
09026011 But the Lord forbid that I should lay a hand on the Lord’s anointed. Now get the spear and water jug that are near his head, and let’s go.”
09026012 So David took the spear and water jug near Saul’s head, and they left. No one saw or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up. They were all sleeping, because the Lord had put them into a deep sleep.
09026013 Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the hill some distance away; there was a wide space between them.
09026014 He called out to the army and to Abner son of Ner, “Aren’t you going to answer me, Abner?” Abner replied, “Who are you who calls to the king?”
09026015 David said, “You’re a man, aren’t you? And who is like you in Israel? Why didn’t you guard your lord the king? Someone came to destroy your lord the king.
09026016 What you have done is not good. As surely as the Lord lives, you and your men must die, because you did not guard your master, the Lord’s anointed. Look around you. Where are the king’s spear and water jug that were near his head?”
09026017 Saul recognized David’s voice and said, “Is that your voice, David my son?” David replied, “Yes it is, my lord the king.”
09026018 And he added, “Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done, and what wrong am I guilty of?
09026019 Now let my lord the king listen to his servant’s words. If the Lord has incited you against me, then may he accept an offering. If, however, people have done it, may they be cursed before the Lord! They have driven me today from my share in the Lord’s inheritance and have said, ‘Go, serve other gods.’
09026020 Now do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of the Lord. The king of Israel has come out to look for a flea—as one hunts a partridge in the mountains.”
09026021 Then Saul said, “I have sinned. Come back, David my son. Because you considered my life precious today, I will not try to harm you again. Surely I have acted like a fool and have been terribly wrong.”
09026022 “Here is the king’s spear,” David answered. “Let one of your young men come over and get it.
09026023 The Lord rewards everyone for their righteousness and faithfulness. The Lord delivered you into my hands today, but I would not lay a hand on the Lord’s anointed.
09026024 As surely as I valued your life today, so may the Lord value my life and deliver me from all trouble.”
09026025 Then Saul said to David, “May you be blessed, David my son; you will do great things and surely triumph.” So David went on his way, and Saul returned home.
09027001 But David thought to himself, “One of these days I will be destroyed by the hand of Saul. The best thing I can do is to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me anywhere in Israel, and I will slip out of his hand.”
09027002 So David and the six hundred men with him left and went over to Achish son of Maok king of Gath.
09027003 David and his men settled in Gath with Achish. Each man had his family with him, and David had his two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of Nabal.
09027004 When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him.
09027005 Then David said to Achish, “If I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be assigned to me in one of the country towns, that I may live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?”
09027006 So on that day Achish gave him Ziklag, and it has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since.
09027007 David lived in Philistine territory a year and four months.
09027008 Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites and the Amalekites. (From ancient times these peoples had lived in the land extending to Shur and Egypt.)
09027009 Whenever David attacked an area, he did not leave a man or woman alive, but took sheep and cattle, donkeys and camels, and clothes. Then he returned to Achish.
09027010 When Achish asked, “Where did you go raiding today?” David would say, “Against the Negev of Judah” or “Against the Negev of Jerahmeel” or “Against the Negev of the Kenites.”
09027011 He did not leave a man or woman alive to be brought to Gath, for he thought, “They might inform on us and say, ‘This is what David did.’ ” And such was his practice as long as he lived in Philistine territory.
09027012 Achish trusted David and said to himself, “He has become so obnoxious to his people, the Israelites, that he will be my servant for life.”
09028001 In those days the Philistines gathered their forces to fight against Israel. Achish said to David, “You must understand that you and your men will accompany me in the army.”
09028002 David said, “Then you will see for yourself what your servant can do.” Achish replied, “Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life.”
09028003 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of Ramah. Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land.
09028004 The Philistines assembled and came and set up camp at Shunem, while Saul gathered all Israel and set up camp at Gilboa.
09028005 When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid; terror filled his heart.
09028006 He inquired of the Lord, but the Lord did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets.
09028007 Saul then said to his attendants, “Find me a woman who is a medium, so I may go and inquire of her.” “There is one in Endor,” they said.
09028008 So Saul disguised himself, putting on other clothes, and at night he and two men went to the woman. “Consult a spirit for me,” he said, “and bring up for me the one I name.”
09028009 But the woman said to him, “Surely you know what Saul has done. He has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why have you set a trap for my life to bring about my death?”
09028010 Saul swore to her by the Lord, “As surely as the Lord lives, you will not be punished for this.”
09028011 Then the woman asked, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” “Bring up Samuel,” he said.
09028012 When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out at the top of her voice and said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!”
09028013 The king said to her, “Don’t be afraid. What do you see?” The woman said, “I see a ghostly figure coming up out of the earth.”
09028014 “What does he look like?” he asked. “An old man wearing a robe is coming up,” she said. Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.
09028015 Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” “I am in great distress,” Saul said. “The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has departed from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do.”
09028016 Samuel said, “Why do you consult me, now that the Lord has departed from you and become your enemy?
09028017 The Lord has done what he predicted through me. The Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighbors—to David.
09028018 Because you did not obey the Lord or carry out his fierce wrath against the Amalekites, the Lord has done this to you today.
09028019 The Lord will deliver both Israel and you into the hands of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The Lord will also give the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.”
09028020 Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, filled with fear because of Samuel’s words. His strength was gone, for he had eaten nothing all that day and all that night.
09028021 When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly shaken, she said, “Look, your servant has obeyed you. I took my life in my hands and did what you told me to do.
09028022 Now please listen to your servant and let me give you some food so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way.”
09028023 He refused and said, “I will not eat.” But his men joined the woman in urging him, and he listened to them. He got up from the ground and sat on the couch.
09028024 The woman had a fattened calf at the house, which she butchered at once. She took some flour, kneaded it and baked bread without yeast.
09028025 Then she set it before Saul and his men, and they ate. That same night they got up and left.
09029001 The Philistines gathered all their forces at Aphek, and Israel camped by the spring in Jezreel.
09029002 As the Philistine rulers marched with their units of hundreds and thousands, David and his men were marching at the rear with Achish.
09029003 The commanders of the Philistines asked, “What about these Hebrews?” Achish replied, “Is this not David, who was an officer of Saul king of Israel? He has already been with me for over a year, and from the day he left Saul until now, I have found no fault in him.”
09029004 But the Philistine commanders were angry with Achish and said, “Send the man back, that he may return to the place you assigned him. He must not go with us into battle, or he will turn against us during the fighting. How better could he regain his master’s favor than by taking the heads of our own men?
09029005 Isn’t this the David they sang about in their dances: “ ‘Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands’?”
09029006 So Achish called David and said to him, “As surely as the Lord lives, you have been reliable, and I would be pleased to have you serve with me in the army. From the day you came to me until today, I have found no fault in you, but the rulers don’t approve of you.
09029007 Now turn back and go in peace; do nothing to displease the Philistine rulers.”
09029008 “But what have I done?” asked David. “What have you found against your servant from the day I came to you until now? Why can’t I go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”
09029009 Achish answered, “I know that you have been as pleasing in my eyes as an angel of God; nevertheless, the Philistine commanders have said, ‘He must not go up with us into battle.’
09029010 Now get up early, along with your master’s servants who have come with you, and leave in the morning as soon as it is light.”
09029011 So David and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the land of the Philistines, and the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
09030001 David and his men reached Ziklag on the third day. Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They had attacked Ziklag and burned it,
09030002 and had taken captive the women and everyone else in it, both young and old. They killed none of them, but carried them off as they went on their way.
09030003 When David and his men reached Ziklag, they found it destroyed by fire and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive.
09030004 So David and his men wept aloud until they had no strength left to weep.
09030005 David’s two wives had been captured—Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
09030006 David was greatly distressed because the men were talking of stoning him; each one was bitter in spirit because of his sons and daughters. But David found strength in the Lord his God.
09030007 Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelek, “Bring me the ephod.” Abiathar brought it to him,
09030008 and David inquired of the Lord, “Shall I pursue this raiding party? Will I overtake them?” “Pursue them,” he answered. “You will certainly overtake them and succeed in the rescue.”
09030009 David and the six hundred men with him came to the Besor Valley, where some stayed behind.
09030010 Two hundred of them were too exhausted to cross the valley, but David and the other four hundred continued the pursuit.
09030011 They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David. They gave him water to drink and food to eat—
09030012 part of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins. He ate and was revived, for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights.
09030013 David asked him, “Who do you belong to? Where do you come from?” He said, “I am an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me when I became ill three days ago.
09030014 We raided the Negev of the Kerethites, some territory belonging to Judah and the Negev of Caleb. And we burned Ziklag.”
09030015 David asked him, “Can you lead me down to this raiding party?” He answered, “Swear to me before God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, and I will take you down to them.”
09030016 He led David down, and there they were, scattered over the countryside, eating, drinking and reveling because of the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from Judah.
09030017 David fought them from dusk until the evening of the next day, and none of them got away, except four hundred young men who rode off on camels and fled.
09030018 David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives.
09030019 Nothing was missing: young or old, boy or girl, plunder or anything else they had taken. David brought everything back.
09030020 He took all the flocks and herds, and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock, saying, “This is David’s plunder.”
09030021 Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow him and who were left behind at the Besor Valley. They came out to meet David and the men with him. As David and his men approached, he asked them how they were.
09030022 But all the evil men and troublemakers among David’s followers said, “Because they did not go out with us, we will not share with them the plunder we recovered. However, each man may take his wife and children and go.”
09030023 David replied, “No, my brothers, you must not do that with what the Lord has given us. He has protected us and delivered into our hands the raiding party that came against us.
09030024 Who will listen to what you say? The share of the man who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle. All will share alike.”
09030025 David made this a statute and ordinance for Israel from that day to this.
09030026 When David reached Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, who were his friends, saying, “Here is a gift for you from the plunder of the Lord’s enemies.”
09030027 David sent it to those who were in Bethel, Ramoth Negev and Jattir;
09030028 to those in Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa
09030029 and Rakal; to those in the towns of the Jerahmeelites and the Kenites;
09030030 to those in Hormah, Bor Ashan, Athak
09030031 and Hebron; and to those in all the other places where he and his men had roamed.
09031001 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; the Israelites fled before them, and many fell dead on Mount Gilboa.
09031002 The Philistines were in hot pursuit of Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua.
09031003 The fighting grew fierce around Saul, and when the archers overtook him, they wounded him critically.
09031004 Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and run me through, or these uncircumcised fellows will come and run me through and abuse me.” But his armor-bearer was terrified and would not do it; so Saul took his own sword and fell on it.
09031005 When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his sword and died with him.
09031006 So Saul and his three sons and his armor-bearer and all his men died together that same day.
09031007 When the Israelites along the valley and those across the Jordan saw that the Israelite army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their towns and fled. And the Philistines came and occupied them.
09031008 The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
09031009 They cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and they sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temple of their idols and among their people.
09031010 They put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths and fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan.
09031011 When the people of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
09031012 all their valiant men marched through the night to Beth Shan. They took down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth Shan and went to Jabesh, where they burned them.
09031013 Then they took their bones and buried them under a tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and they fasted seven days.
10001001 After the death of Saul, David returned from striking down the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days.
10001002 On the third day a man arrived from Saul’s camp with his clothes torn and dust on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him honor.
10001003 “Where have you come from?” David asked him. He answered, “I have escaped from the Israelite camp.”
10001004 “What happened?” David asked. “Tell me.” “The men fled from the battle,” he replied. “Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.”
10001005 Then David said to the young man who brought him the report, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”
10001006 “I happened to be on Mount Gilboa,” the young man said, “and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and their drivers in hot pursuit.
10001007 When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, and I said, ‘What can I do?’
10001008 “He asked me, ‘Who are you?’ “ ‘An Amalekite,’ I answered.
10001009 “Then he said to me, ‘Stand here by me and kill me! I’m in the throes of death, but I’m still alive.’
10001010 “So I stood beside him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band on his arm and have brought them here to my lord.”
10001011 Then David and all the men with him took hold of their clothes and tore them.
10001012 They mourned and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the army of the Lord and for the nation of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.
10001013 David said to the young man who brought him the report, “Where are you from?” “I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite,” he answered.
10001014 David asked him, “Why weren’t you afraid to lift your hand to destroy the Lord’s anointed?”
10001015 Then David called one of his men and said, “Go, strike him down!” So he struck him down, and he died.
10001016 For David had said to him, “Your blood be on your own head. Your own mouth testified against you when you said, ‘I killed the Lord’s anointed.’ ”
10001017 David took up this lament concerning Saul and his son Jonathan,
10001018 and he ordered that the people of Judah be taught this lament of the bow (it is written in the Book of Jashar):
10001019 “A gazelle lies slain on your heights, Israel. How the mighty have fallen!
10001020 “Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines be glad, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice.
10001021 “Mountains of Gilboa, may you have neither dew nor rain, may no showers fall on your terraced fields. For there the shield of the mighty was despised, the shield of Saul—no longer rubbed with oil.
10001022 “From the blood of the slain, from the flesh of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, the sword of Saul did not return unsatisfied.
10001023 Saul and Jonathan— in life they were loved and admired, and in death they were not parted. They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
10001024 “Daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and finery, who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold.
10001025 “How the mighty have fallen in battle! Jonathan lies slain on your heights.
10001026 I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; you were very dear to me. Your love for me was wonderful, more wonderful than that of women.
10001027 “How the mighty have fallen! The weapons of war have perished!”
10002001 In the course of time, David inquired of the Lord. “Shall I go up to one of the towns of Judah?” he asked. The Lord said, “Go up.” David asked, “Where shall I go?” “To Hebron,” the Lord answered.
10002002 So David went up there with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
10002003 David also took the men who were with him, each with his family, and they settled in Hebron and its towns.
10002004 Then the men of Judah came to Hebron, and there they anointed David king over the tribe of Judah. When David was told that it was the men from Jabesh Gilead who had buried Saul,
10002005 he sent messengers to them to say to them, “The Lord bless you for showing this kindness to Saul your master by burying him.
10002006 May the Lord now show you kindness and faithfulness, and I too will show you the same favor because you have done this.
10002007 Now then, be strong and brave, for Saul your master is dead, and the people of Judah have anointed me king over them.”
10002008 Meanwhile, Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ish-Bosheth son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim.
10002009 He made him king over Gilead, Ashuri and Jezreel, and also over Ephraim, Benjamin and all Israel.
10002010 Ish-Bosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he reigned two years. The tribe of Judah, however, remained loyal to David.
10002011 The length of time David was king in Hebron over Judah was seven years and six months.
10002012 Abner son of Ner, together with the men of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon.
10002013 Joab son of Zeruiah and David’s men went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. One group sat down on one side of the pool and one group on the other side.
10002014 Then Abner said to Joab, “Let’s have some of the young men get up and fight hand to hand in front of us.” “All right, let them do it,” Joab said.
10002015 So they stood up and were counted off—twelve men for Benjamin and Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve for David.
10002016 Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his dagger into his opponent’s side, and they fell down together. So that place in Gibeon was called Helkath Hazzurim.
10002017 The battle that day was very fierce, and Abner and the Israelites were defeated by David’s men.
10002018 The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai and Asahel. Now Asahel was as fleet-footed as a wild gazelle.
10002019 He chased Abner, turning neither to the right nor to the left as he pursued him.
10002020 Abner looked behind him and asked, “Is that you, Asahel?” “It is,” he answered.
10002021 Then Abner said to him, “Turn aside to the right or to the left; take on one of the young men and strip him of his weapons.” But Asahel would not stop chasing him.
10002022 Again Abner warned Asahel, “Stop chasing me! Why should I strike you down? How could I look your brother Joab in the face?”
10002023 But Asahel refused to give up the pursuit; so Abner thrust the butt of his spear into Asahel’s stomach, and the spear came out through his back. He fell there and died on the spot. And every man stopped when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died.
10002024 But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and as the sun was setting, they came to the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the way to the wasteland of Gibeon.
10002025 Then the men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner. They formed themselves into a group and took their stand on top of a hill.
10002026 Abner called out to Joab, “Must the sword devour forever? Don’t you realize that this will end in bitterness? How long before you order your men to stop pursuing their fellow Israelites?”
10002027 Joab answered, “As surely as God lives, if you had not spoken, the men would have continued pursuing them until morning.”
10002028 So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the troops came to a halt; they no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight anymore.
10002029 All that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, continued through the morning hours and came to Mahanaim.
10002030 Then Joab stopped pursuing Abner and assembled the whole army. Besides Asahel, nineteen of David’s men were found missing.
10002031 But David’s men had killed three hundred and sixty Benjamites who were with Abner.
10002032 They took Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb at Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night and arrived at Hebron by daybreak.
10003001 The war between the house of Saul and the house of David lasted a long time. David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.
10003002 Sons were born to David in Hebron: His firstborn was Amnon the son of Ahinoam of Jezreel;
10003003 his second, Kileab the son of Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; the third, Absalom the son of Maakah daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
10003004 the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
10003005 and the sixth, Ithream the son of David’s wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron.
10003006 During the war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner had been strengthening his own position in the house of Saul.
10003007 Now Saul had had a concubine named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. And Ish-Bosheth said to Abner, “Why did you sleep with my father’s concubine?”
10003008 Abner was very angry because of what Ish-Bosheth said. So he answered, “Am I a dog’s head—on Judah’s side? This very day I am loyal to the house of your father Saul and to his family and friends. I haven’t handed you over to David. Yet now you accuse me of an offense involving this woman!
10003009 May God deal with Abner, be it ever so severely, if I do not do for David what the Lord promised him on oath
10003010 and transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish David’s throne over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba.”
10003011 Ish-Bosheth did not dare to say another word to Abner, because he was afraid of him.
10003012 Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to say to David, “Whose land is it? Make an agreement with me, and I will help you bring all Israel over to you.”
10003013 “Good,” said David. “I will make an agreement with you. But I demand one thing of you: Do not come into my presence unless you bring Michal daughter of Saul when you come to see me.”
10003014 Then David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, demanding, “Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for the price of a hundred Philistine foreskins.”
10003015 So Ish-Bosheth gave orders and had her taken away from her husband Paltiel son of Laish.
10003016 Her husband, however, went with her, weeping behind her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go back home!” So he went back.
10003017 Abner conferred with the elders of Israel and said, “For some time you have wanted to make David your king.
10003018 Now do it! For the Lord promised David, ‘By my servant David I will rescue my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.’ ”
10003019 Abner also spoke to the Benjamites in person. Then he went to Hebron to tell David everything that Israel and the whole tribe of Benjamin wanted to do.
10003020 When Abner, who had twenty men with him, came to David at Hebron, David prepared a feast for him and his men.
10003021 Then Abner said to David, “Let me go at once and assemble all Israel for my lord the king, so that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may rule over all that your heart desires.” So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.
10003022 Just then David’s men and Joab returned from a raid and brought with them a great deal of plunder. But Abner was no longer with David in Hebron, because David had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.
10003023 When Joab and all the soldiers with him arrived, he was told that Abner son of Ner had come to the king and that the king had sent him away and that he had gone in peace.
10003024 So Joab went to the king and said, “What have you done? Look, Abner came to you. Why did you let him go? Now he is gone!
10003025 You know Abner son of Ner; he came to deceive you and observe your movements and find out everything you are doing.”
10003026 Joab then left David and sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern at Sirah. But David did not know it.
10003027 Now when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into an inner chamber, as if to speak with him privately. And there, to avenge the blood of his brother Asahel, Joab stabbed him in the stomach, and he died.
10003028 Later, when David heard about this, he said, “I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the Lord concerning the blood of Abner son of Ner.
10003029 May his blood fall on the head of Joab and on his whole family! May Joab’s family never be without someone who has a running sore or leprosy or who leans on a crutch or who falls by the sword or who lacks food.”
10003030 (Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.)
10003031 Then David said to Joab and all the people with him, “Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and walk in mourning in front of Abner.” King David himself walked behind the bier.
10003032 They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king wept aloud at Abner’s tomb. All the people wept also.
10003033 The king sang this lament for Abner: “Should Abner have died as the lawless die?
10003034 Your hands were not bound, your feet were not fettered. You fell as one falls before the wicked.” And all the people wept over him again.
10003035 Then they all came and urged David to eat something while it was still day; but David took an oath, saying, “May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets!”
10003036 All the people took note and were pleased; indeed, everything the king did pleased them.
10003037 So on that day all the people there and all Israel knew that the king had no part in the murder of Abner son of Ner.
10003038 Then the king said to his men, “Do you not realize that a commander and a great man has fallen in Israel this day?
10003039 And today, though I am the anointed king, I am weak, and these sons of Zeruiah are too strong for me. May the Lord repay the evildoer according to his evil deeds!”
10004001 When Ish-Bosheth son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost courage, and all Israel became alarmed.
10004002 Now Saul’s son had two men who were leaders of raiding bands. One was named Baanah and the other Rekab; they were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite from the tribe of Benjamin—Beeroth is considered part of Benjamin,
10004003 because the people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim and have resided there as foreigners to this day.
10004004 (Jonathan son of Saul had a son who was lame in both feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled, but as she hurried to leave, he fell and became disabled. His name was Mephibosheth.)
10004005 Now Rekab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, set out for the house of Ish-Bosheth, and they arrived there in the heat of the day while he was taking his noonday rest.
10004006 They went into the inner part of the house as if to get some wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rekab and his brother Baanah slipped away.
10004007 They had gone into the house while he was lying on the bed in his bedroom. After they stabbed and killed him, they cut off his head. Taking it with them, they traveled all night by way of the Arabah.
10004008 They brought the head of Ish-Bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, “Here is the head of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, your enemy, who tried to kill you. This day the Lord has avenged my lord the king against Saul and his offspring.”
10004009 David answered Rekab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, “As surely as the Lord lives, who has delivered me out of every trouble,
10004010 when someone told me, ‘Saul is dead,’ and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and put him to death in Ziklag. That was the reward I gave him for his news!
10004011 How much more—when wicked men have killed an innocent man in his own house and on his own bed—should I not now demand his blood from your hand and rid the earth of you!”
10004012 So David gave an order to his men, and they killed them. They cut off their hands and feet and hung the bodies by the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-Bosheth and buried it in Abner’s tomb at Hebron.
10005001 All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, “We are your own flesh and blood.
10005002 In the past, while Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the Lord said to you, ‘You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.’ ”
10005003 When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, the king made a covenant with them at Hebron before the Lord, and they anointed David king over Israel.
10005004 David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years.
10005005 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.
10005006 The king and his men marched to Jerusalem to attack the Jebusites, who lived there. The Jebusites said to David, “You will not get in here; even the blind and the lame can ward you off.” They thought, “David cannot get in here.”
10005007 Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion—which is the City of David.
10005008 On that day David had said, “Anyone who conquers the Jebusites will have to use the water shaft to reach those ‘lame and blind’ who are David’s enemies. ” That is why they say, “The ‘blind and lame’ will not enter the palace.”
10005009 David then took up residence in the fortress and called it the City of David. He built up the area around it, from the terraces inward.
10005010 And he became more and more powerful, because the Lord God Almighty was with him.
10005011 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent envoys to David, along with cedar logs and carpenters and stonemasons, and they built a palace for David.
10005012 Then David knew that the Lord had established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.
10005013 After he left Hebron, David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem, and more sons and daughters were born to him.
10005014 These are the names of the children born to him there: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
10005015 Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
10005016 Elishama, Eliada and Eliphelet.
10005017 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, they went up in full force to search for him, but David heard about it and went down to the stronghold.
10005018 Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim;
10005019 so David inquired of the Lord, “Shall I go and attack the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hands?” The Lord answered him, “Go, for I will surely deliver the Philistines into your hands.”
10005020 So David went to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He said, “As waters break out, the Lord has broken out against my enemies before me.” So that place was called Baal Perazim.
10005021 The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David and his men carried them off.
10005022 Once more the Philistines came up and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim;
10005023 so David inquired of the Lord, and he answered, “Do not go straight up, but circle around behind them and attack them in front of the poplar trees.
10005024 As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the poplar trees, move quickly, because that will mean the Lord has gone out in front of you to strike the Philistine army.”
10005025 So David did as the Lord commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.
10006001 David again brought together all the able young men of Israel—thirty thousand.
10006002 He and all his men went to Baalah in Judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name, the name of the Lord Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim on the ark.
10006003 They set the ark of God on a new cart and brought it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart
10006004 with the ark of God on it, and Ahio was walking in front of it.
10006005 David and all Israel were celebrating with all their might before the Lord, with castanets, harps, lyres, timbrels, sistrums and cymbals.
10006006 When they came to the threshing floor of Nakon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God, because the oxen stumbled.
10006007 The Lord’s anger burned against Uzzah because of his irreverent act; therefore God struck him down, and he died there beside the ark of God.
10006008 Then David was angry because the Lord’s wrath had broken out against Uzzah, and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah.
10006009 David was afraid of the Lord that day and said, “How can the ark of the Lord ever come to me?”
10006010 He was not willing to take the ark of the Lord to be with him in the City of David. Instead, he took it to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
10006011 The ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for three months, and the Lord blessed him and his entire household.
10006012 Now King David was told, “The Lord has blessed the household of Obed-Edom and everything he has, because of the ark of God.” So David went to bring up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David with rejoicing.
10006013 When those who were carrying the ark of the Lord had taken six steps, he sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf.
10006014 Wearing a linen ephod, David was dancing before the Lord with all his might,
10006015 while he and all Israel were bringing up the ark of the Lord with shouts and the sound of trumpets.
10006016 As the ark of the Lord was entering the City of David, Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. And when she saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord, she despised him in her heart.
10006017 They brought the ark of the Lord and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it, and David sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before the Lord.
10006018 After he had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord Almighty.
10006019 Then he gave a loaf of bread, a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each person in the whole crowd of Israelites, both men and women. And all the people went to their homes.
10006020 When David returned home to bless his household, Michal daughter of Saul came out to meet him and said, “How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today, going around half-naked in full view of the slave girls of his servants as any vulgar fellow would!”
10006021 David said to Michal, “It was before the Lord, who chose me rather than your father or anyone from his house when he appointed me ruler over the Lord’s people Israel—I will celebrate before the Lord.
10006022 I will become even more undignified than this, and I will be humiliated in my own eyes. But by these slave girls you spoke of, I will be held in honor.”
10006023 And Michal daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death.
10007001 After the king was settled in his palace and the Lord had given him rest from all his enemies around him,
10007002 he said to Nathan the prophet, “Here I am, living in a house of cedar, while the ark of God remains in a tent.”
10007003 Nathan replied to the king, “Whatever you have in mind, go ahead and do it, for the Lord is with you.”
10007004 But that night the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying:
10007005 “Go and tell my servant David, ‘This is what the Lord says: Are you the one to build me a house to dwell in?
10007006 I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought the Israelites up out of Egypt to this day. I have been moving from place to place with a tent as my dwelling.
10007007 Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their rulers whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, “Why have you not built me a house of cedar?” ’
10007008 “Now then, tell my servant David, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty says: I took you from the pasture, from tending the flock, and appointed you ruler over my people Israel.
10007009 I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name great, like the names of the greatest men on earth.
10007010 And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning
10007011 and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel. I will also give you rest from all your enemies. “ ‘The Lord declares to you that the Lord himself will establish a house for you:
10007012 When your days are over and you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, your own flesh and blood, and I will establish his kingdom.
10007013 He is the one who will build a house for my Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
10007014 I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will punish him with a rod wielded by men, with floggings inflicted by human hands.
10007015 But my love will never be taken away from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you.
10007016 Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me ; your throne will be established forever.’ ”
10007017 Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation.
10007018 Then King David went in and sat before the Lord, and he said: “Who am I, Sovereign Lord, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?
10007019 And as if this were not enough in your sight, Sovereign Lord, you have also spoken about the future of the house of your servant—and this decree, Sovereign Lord, is for a mere human!
10007020 “What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, Sovereign Lord.
10007021 For the sake of your word and according to your will, you have done this great thing and made it known to your servant.
10007022 “How great you are, Sovereign Lord! There is no one like you, and there is no God but you, as we have heard with our own ears.
10007023 And who is like your people Israel—the one nation on earth that God went out to redeem as a people for himself, and to make a name for himself, and to perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations and their gods from before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt?
10007024 You have established your people Israel as your very own forever, and you, Lord, have become their God.
10007025 “And now, Lord God, keep forever the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house. Do as you promised,
10007026 so that your name will be great forever. Then people will say, ‘The Lord Almighty is God over Israel!’ And the house of your servant David will be established in your sight.
10007027 “Lord Almighty, God of Israel, you have revealed this to your servant, saying, ‘I will build a house for you.’ So your servant has found courage to pray this prayer to you.
10007028 Sovereign Lord, you are God! Your covenant is trustworthy, and you have promised these good things to your servant.
10007029 Now be pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever in your sight; for you, Sovereign Lord, have spoken, and with your blessing the house of your servant will be blessed forever.”
10008001 In the course of time, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and he took Metheg Ammah from the control of the Philistines.
10008002 David also defeated the Moabites. He made them lie down on the ground and measured them off with a length of cord. Every two lengths of them were put to death, and the third length was allowed to live. So the Moabites became subject to David and brought him tribute.
10008003 Moreover, David defeated Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah, when he went to restore his monument at the Euphrates River.
10008004 David captured a thousand of his chariots, seven thousand charioteers and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He hamstrung all but a hundred of the chariot horses.
10008005 When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand of them.
10008006 He put garrisons in the Aramean kingdom of Damascus, and the Arameans became subject to him and brought tribute. The Lord gave David victory wherever he went.
10008007 David took the gold shields that belonged to the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
10008008 From Tebah and Berothai, towns that belonged to Hadadezer, King David took a great quantity of bronze.
10008009 When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer,
10008010 he sent his son Joram to King David to greet him and congratulate him on his victory in battle over Hadadezer, who had been at war with Tou. Joram brought with him articles of silver, of gold and of bronze.
10008011 King David dedicated these articles to the Lord, as he had done with the silver and gold from all the nations he had subdued:
10008012 Edom and Moab, the Ammonites and the Philistines, and Amalek. He also dedicated the plunder taken from Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
10008013 And David became famous after he returned from striking down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
10008014 He put garrisons throughout Edom, and all the Edomites became subject to David. The Lord gave David victory wherever he went.
10008015 David reigned over all Israel, doing what was just and right for all his people.
10008016 Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder;
10008017 Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelek son of Abiathar were priests; Seraiah was secretary;
10008018 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites; and David’s sons were priests.
10009001 David asked, “Is there anyone still left of the house of Saul to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan’s sake?”
10009002 Now there was a servant of Saul’s household named Ziba. They summoned him to appear before David, and the king said to him, “Are you Ziba?” “At your service,” he replied.
10009003 The king asked, “Is there no one still alive from the house of Saul to whom I can show God’s kindness?” Ziba answered the king, “There is still a son of Jonathan; he is lame in both feet.”
10009004 “Where is he?” the king asked. Ziba answered, “He is at the house of Makir son of Ammiel in Lo Debar.”
10009005 So King David had him brought from Lo Debar, from the house of Makir son of Ammiel.
10009006 When Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, he bowed down to pay him honor. David said, “Mephibosheth!” “At your service,” he replied.
10009007 “Don’t be afraid,” David said to him, “for I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table.”
10009008 Mephibosheth bowed down and said, “What is your servant, that you should notice a dead dog like me?”
10009009 Then the king summoned Ziba, Saul’s steward, and said to him, “I have given your master’s grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family.
10009010 You and your sons and your servants are to farm the land for him and bring in the crops, so that your master’s grandson may be provided for. And Mephibosheth, grandson of your master, will always eat at my table.” (Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.)
10009011 Then Ziba said to the king, “Your servant will do whatever my lord the king commands his servant to do.” So Mephibosheth ate at David’s table like one of the king’s sons.
10009012 Mephibosheth had a young son named Mika, and all the members of Ziba’s household were servants of Mephibosheth.
10009013 And Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, because he always ate at the king’s table; he was lame in both feet.
10010001 In the course of time, the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun succeeded him as king.
10010002 David thought, “I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father. When David’s men came to the land of the Ammonites,
10010003 the Ammonite commanders said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think David is honoring your father by sending envoys to you to express sympathy? Hasn’t David sent them to you only to explore the city and spy it out and overthrow it?”
10010004 So Hanun seized David’s envoys, shaved off half of each man’s beard, cut off their garments at the buttocks, and sent them away.
10010005 When David was told about this, he sent messengers to meet the men, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, “Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back.”
10010006 When the Ammonites realized that they had become obnoxious to David, they hired twenty thousand Aramean foot soldiers from Beth Rehob and Zobah, as well as the king of Maakah with a thousand men, and also twelve thousand men from Tob.
10010007 On hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men.
10010008 The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance of their city gate, while the Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maakah were by themselves in the open country.
10010009 Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him; so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans.
10010010 He put the rest of the men under the command of Abishai his brother and deployed them against the Ammonites.
10010011 Joab said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to come to my rescue; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come to rescue you.
10010012 Be strong, and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. The Lord will do what is good in his sight.”
10010013 Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans, and they fled before him.
10010014 When the Ammonites realized that the Arameans were fleeing, they fled before Abishai and went inside the city. So Joab returned from fighting the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem.
10010015 After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they regrouped.
10010016 Hadadezer had Arameans brought from beyond the Euphrates River; they went to Helam, with Shobak the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them.
10010017 When David was told of this, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan and went to Helam. The Arameans formed their battle lines to meet David and fought against him.
10010018 But they fled before Israel, and David killed seven hundred of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers. He also struck down Shobak the commander of their army, and he died there.
10010019 When all the kings who were vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been routed by Israel, they made peace with the Israelites and became subject to them. So the Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore.
10011001 In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war, David sent Joab out with the king’s men and the whole Israelite army. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained in Jerusalem.
10011002 One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very beautiful,
10011003 and David sent someone to find out about her. The man said, “She is Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.”
10011004 Then David sent messengers to get her. She came to him, and he slept with her. (Now she was purifying herself from her monthly uncleanness.) Then she went back home.
10011005 The woman conceived and sent word to David, saying, “I am pregnant.”
10011006 So David sent this word to Joab: “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” And Joab sent him to David.
10011007 When Uriah came to him, David asked him how Joab was, how the soldiers were and how the war was going.
10011008 Then David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” So Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the king was sent after him.
10011009 But Uriah slept at the entrance to the palace with all his master’s servants and did not go down to his house.
10011010 David was told, “Uriah did not go home.” So he asked Uriah, “Haven’t you just come from a military campaign? Why didn’t you go home?”
10011011 Uriah said to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in tents, and my commander Joab and my lord’s men are camped in the open country. How could I go to my house to eat and drink and make love to my wife? As surely as you live, I will not do such a thing!”
10011012 Then David said to him, “Stay here one more day, and tomorrow I will send you back.” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next.
10011013 At David’s invitation, he ate and drank with him, and David made him drunk. But in the evening Uriah went out to sleep on his mat among his master’s servants; he did not go home.
10011014 In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah.
10011015 In it he wrote, “Put Uriah out in front where the fighting is fiercest. Then withdraw from him so he will be struck down and die.”
10011016 So while Joab had the city under siege, he put Uriah at a place where he knew the strongest defenders were.
10011017 When the men of the city came out and fought against Joab, some of the men in David’s army fell; moreover, Uriah the Hittite died.
10011018 Joab sent David a full account of the battle.
10011019 He instructed the messenger: “When you have finished giving the king this account of the battle,
10011020 the king’s anger may flare up, and he may ask you, ‘Why did you get so close to the city to fight? Didn’t you know they would shoot arrows from the wall?
10011021 Who killed Abimelek son of Jerub-Besheth ? Didn’t a woman drop an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you get so close to the wall?’ If he asks you this, then say to him, ‘Moreover, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.’ ”
10011022 The messenger set out, and when he arrived he told David everything Joab had sent him to say.
10011023 The messenger said to David, “The men overpowered us and came out against us in the open, but we drove them back to the entrance of the city gate.
10011024 Then the archers shot arrows at your servants from the wall, and some of the king’s men died. Moreover, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.”
10011025 David told the messenger, “Say this to Joab: ‘Don’t let this upset you; the sword devours one as well as another. Press the attack against the city and destroy it.’ Say this to encourage Joab.”
10011026 When Uriah’s wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him.
10011027 After the time of mourning was over, David had her brought to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing David had done displeased the Lord.
10012001 The Lord sent Nathan to David. When he came to him, he said, “There were two men in a certain town, one rich and the other poor.
10012002 The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle,
10012003 but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food, drank from his cup and even slept in his arms. It was like a daughter to him.
10012004 “Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him.”
10012005 David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan, “As surely as the Lord lives, the man who did this must die!
10012006 He must pay for that lamb four times over, because he did such a thing and had no pity.”
10012007 Then Nathan said to David, “You are the man! This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul.
10012008 I gave your master’s house to you, and your master’s wives into your arms. I gave you all Israel and Judah. And if all this had been too little, I would have given you even more.
10012009 Why did you despise the word of the Lord by doing what is evil in his eyes? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own. You killed him with the sword of the Ammonites.
10012010 Now, therefore, the sword will never depart from your house, because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.’
10012011 “This is what the Lord says: ‘Out of your own household I am going to bring calamity on you. Before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to one who is close to you, and he will sleep with your wives in broad daylight.
10012012 You did it in secret, but I will do this thing in broad daylight before all Israel.’ ”
10012013 Then David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the Lord.” Nathan replied, “The Lord has taken away your sin. You are not going to die.
10012014 But because by doing this you have shown utter contempt for the Lord, the son born to you will die.”
10012015 After Nathan had gone home, the Lord struck the child that Uriah’s wife had borne to David, and he became ill.
10012016 David pleaded with God for the child. He fasted and spent the nights lying in sackcloth on the ground.
10012017 The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he refused, and he would not eat any food with them.
10012018 On the seventh day the child died. David’s attendants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they thought, “While the child was still living, he wouldn’t listen to us when we spoke to him. How can we now tell him the child is dead? He may do something desperate.”
10012019 David noticed that his attendants were whispering among themselves, and he realized the child was dead. “Is the child dead?” he asked. “Yes,” they replied, “he is dead.”
10012020 Then David got up from the ground. After he had washed, put on lotions and changed his clothes, he went into the house of the Lord and worshiped. Then he went to his own house, and at his request they served him food, and he ate.
10012021 His attendants asked him, “Why are you acting this way? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but now that the child is dead, you get up and eat!”
10012022 He answered, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept. I thought, ‘Who knows? The Lord may be gracious to me and let the child live.’
10012023 But now that he is dead, why should I go on fasting? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.”
10012024 Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and he went to her and made love to her. She gave birth to a son, and they named him Solomon. The Lord loved him;
10012025 and because the Lord loved him, he sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah.
10012026 Meanwhile Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured the royal citadel.
10012027 Joab then sent messengers to David, saying, “I have fought against Rabbah and taken its water supply.
10012028 Now muster the rest of the troops and besiege the city and capture it. Otherwise I will take the city, and it will be named after me.”
10012029 So David mustered the entire army and went to Rabbah, and attacked and captured it.
10012030 David took the crown from their king’s head, and it was placed on his own head. It weighed a talent of gold, and it was set with precious stones. David took a great quantity of plunder from the city
10012031 and brought out the people who were there, consigning them to labor with saws and with iron picks and axes, and he made them work at brickmaking. David did this to all the Ammonite towns. Then he and his entire army returned to Jerusalem.
10013001 In the course of time, Amnon son of David fell in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of Absalom son of David.
10013002 Amnon became so obsessed with his sister Tamar that he made himself ill. She was a virgin, and it seemed impossible for him to do anything to her.
10013003 Now Amnon had an adviser named Jonadab son of Shimeah, David’s brother. Jonadab was a very shrewd man.
10013004 He asked Amnon, “Why do you, the king’s son, look so haggard morning after morning? Won’t you tell me?” Amnon said to him, “I’m in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.”
10013005 “Go to bed and pretend to be ill,” Jonadab said. “When your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘I would like my sister Tamar to come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I may watch her and then eat it from her hand.’ ”
10013006 So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him, “I would like my sister Tamar to come and make some special bread in my sight, so I may eat from her hand.”
10013007 David sent word to Tamar at the palace: “Go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some food for him.”
10013008 So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took some dough, kneaded it, made the bread in his sight and baked it.
10013009 Then she took the pan and served him the bread, but he refused to eat. “Send everyone out of here,” Amnon said. So everyone left him.
10013010 Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food here into my bedroom so I may eat from your hand.” And Tamar took the bread she had prepared and brought it to her brother Amnon in his bedroom.
10013011 But when she took it to him to eat, he grabbed her and said, “Come to bed with me, my sister.”
10013012 “No, my brother!” she said to him. “Don’t force me! Such a thing should not be done in Israel! Don’t do this wicked thing.
10013013 What about me? Where could I get rid of my disgrace? And what about you? You would be like one of the wicked fools in Israel. Please speak to the king; he will not keep me from being married to you.”
10013014 But he refused to listen to her, and since he was stronger than she, he raped her.
10013015 Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her. Amnon said to her, “Get up and get out!”
10013016 “No!” she said to him. “Sending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me.” But he refused to listen to her.
10013017 He called his personal servant and said, “Get this woman out of my sight and bolt the door after her.”
10013018 So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her. She was wearing an ornate robe, for this was the kind of garment the virgin daughters of the king wore.
10013019 Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the ornate robe she was wearing. She put her hands on her head and went away, weeping aloud as she went.
10013020 Her brother Absalom said to her, “Has that Amnon, your brother, been with you? Be quiet for now, my sister; he is your brother. Don’t take this thing to heart.” And Tamar lived in her brother Absalom’s house, a desolate woman.
10013021 When King David heard all this, he was furious.
10013022 And Absalom never said a word to Amnon, either good or bad; he hated Amnon because he had disgraced his sister Tamar.
10013023 Two years later, when Absalom’s sheepshearers were at Baal Hazor near the border of Ephraim, he invited all the king’s sons to come there.
10013024 Absalom went to the king and said, “Your servant has had shearers come. Will the king and his attendants please join me?”
10013025 “No, my son,” the king replied. “All of us should not go; we would only be a burden to you.” Although Absalom urged him, he still refused to go but gave him his blessing.
10013026 Then Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon come with us.” The king asked him, “Why should he go with you?”
10013027 But Absalom urged him, so he sent with him Amnon and the rest of the king’s sons.
10013028 Absalom ordered his men, “Listen! When Amnon is in high spirits from drinking wine and I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon down,’ then kill him. Don’t be afraid. Haven’t I given you this order? Be strong and brave.”
10013029 So Absalom’s men did to Amnon what Absalom had ordered. Then all the king’s sons got up, mounted their mules and fled.
10013030 While they were on their way, the report came to David: “Absalom has struck down all the king’s sons; not one of them is left.”
10013031 The king stood up, tore his clothes and lay down on the ground; and all his attendants stood by with their clothes torn.
10013032 But Jonadab son of Shimeah, David’s brother, said, “My lord should not think that they killed all the princes; only Amnon is dead. This has been Absalom’s express intention ever since the day Amnon raped his sister Tamar.
10013033 My lord the king should not be concerned about the report that all the king’s sons are dead. Only Amnon is dead.”
10013034 Meanwhile, Absalom had fled. Now the man standing watch looked up and saw many people on the road west of him, coming down the side of the hill. The watchman went and told the king, “I see men in the direction of Horonaim, on the side of the hill.”
10013035 Jonadab said to the king, “See, the king’s sons have come; it has happened just as your servant said.”
10013036 As he finished speaking, the king’s sons came in, wailing loudly. The king, too, and all his attendants wept very bitterly.
10013037 Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. But King David mourned many days for his son.
10013038 After Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he stayed there three years.
10013039 And King David longed to go to Absalom, for he was consoled concerning Amnon’s death.
10014001 Joab son of Zeruiah knew that the king’s heart longed for Absalom.
10014002 So Joab sent someone to Tekoa and had a wise woman brought from there. He said to her, “Pretend you are in mourning. Dress in mourning clothes, and don’t use any cosmetic lotions. Act like a woman who has spent many days grieving for the dead.
10014003 Then go to the king and speak these words to him.” And Joab put the words in her mouth.
10014004 When the woman from Tekoa went to the king, she fell with her face to the ground to pay him honor, and she said, “Help me, Your Majesty!”
10014005 The king asked her, “What is troubling you?” She said, “I am a widow; my husband is dead.
10014006 I your servant had two sons. They got into a fight with each other in the field, and no one was there to separate them. One struck the other and killed him.
10014007 Now the whole clan has risen up against your servant; they say, ‘Hand over the one who struck his brother down, so that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed; then we will get rid of the heir as well.’ They would put out the only burning coal I have left, leaving my husband neither name nor descendant on the face of the earth.”
10014008 The king said to the woman, “Go home, and I will issue an order in your behalf.”
10014009 But the woman from Tekoa said to him, “Let my lord the king pardon me and my family, and let the king and his throne be without guilt.”
10014010 The king replied, “If anyone says anything to you, bring them to me, and they will not bother you again.”
10014011 She said, “Then let the king invoke the Lord his God to prevent the avenger of blood from adding to the destruction, so that my son will not be destroyed.” “As surely as the Lord lives,” he said, “not one hair of your son’s head will fall to the ground.”
10014012 Then the woman said, “Let your servant speak a word to my lord the king.” “Speak,” he replied.
10014013 The woman said, “Why then have you devised a thing like this against the people of God? When the king says this, does he not convict himself, for the king has not brought back his banished son?
10014014 Like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be recovered, so we must die. But that is not what God desires; rather, he devises ways so that a banished person does not remain banished from him.
10014015 “And now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. Your servant thought, ‘I will speak to the king; perhaps he will grant his servant’s request.
10014016 Perhaps the king will agree to deliver his servant from the hand of the man who is trying to cut off both me and my son from God’s inheritance.’
10014017 “And now your servant says, ‘May the word of my lord the king secure my inheritance, for my lord the king is like an angel of God in discerning good and evil. May the Lord your God be with you.’ ”
10014018 Then the king said to the woman, “Don’t keep from me the answer to what I am going to ask you.” “Let my lord the king speak,” the woman said.
10014019 The king asked, “Isn’t the hand of Joab with you in all this?” The woman answered, “As surely as you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything my lord the king says. Yes, it was your servant Joab who instructed me to do this and who put all these words into the mouth of your servant.
10014020 Your servant Joab did this to change the present situation. My lord has wisdom like that of an angel of God—he knows everything that happens in the land.”
10014021 The king said to Joab, “Very well, I will do it. Go, bring back the young man Absalom.”
10014022 Joab fell with his face to the ground to pay him honor, and he blessed the king. Joab said, “Today your servant knows that he has found favor in your eyes, my lord the king, because the king has granted his servant’s request.”
10014023 Then Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.
10014024 But the king said, “He must go to his own house; he must not see my face.” So Absalom went to his own house and did not see the face of the king.
10014025 In all Israel there was not a man so highly praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom. From the top of his head to the sole of his foot there was no blemish in him.
10014026 Whenever he cut the hair of his head—he used to cut his hair once a year because it became too heavy for him—he would weigh it, and its weight was two hundred shekels by the royal standard.
10014027 Three sons and a daughter were born to Absalom. His daughter’s name was Tamar, and she became a beautiful woman.
10014028 Absalom lived two years in Jerusalem without seeing the king’s face.
10014029 Then Absalom sent for Joab in order to send him to the king, but Joab refused to come to him. So he sent a second time, but he refused to come.
10014030 Then he said to his servants, “Look, Joab’s field is next to mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.
10014031 Then Joab did go to Absalom’s house, and he said to him, “Why have your servants set my field on fire?”
10014032 Absalom said to Joab, “Look, I sent word to you and said, ‘Come here so I can send you to the king to ask, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me if I were still there!” ’ Now then, I want to see the king’s face, and if I am guilty of anything, let him put me to death.”
10014033 So Joab went to the king and told him this. Then the king summoned Absalom, and he came in and bowed down with his face to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.
10015001 In the course of time, Absalom provided himself with a chariot and horses and with fifty men to run ahead of him.
10015002 He would get up early and stand by the side of the road leading to the city gate. Whenever anyone came with a complaint to be placed before the king for a decision, Absalom would call out to him, “What town are you from?” He would answer, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.”
10015003 Then Absalom would say to him, “Look, your claims are valid and proper, but there is no representative of the king to hear you.”
10015004 And Absalom would add, “If only I were appointed judge in the land! Then everyone who has a complaint or case could come to me and I would see that they receive justice.”
10015005 Also, whenever anyone approached him to bow down before him, Absalom would reach out his hand, take hold of him and kiss him.
10015006 Absalom behaved in this way toward all the Israelites who came to the king asking for justice, and so he stole the hearts of the people of Israel.
10015007 At the end of four years, Absalom said to the king, “Let me go to Hebron and fulfill a vow I made to the Lord.
10015008 While your servant was living at Geshur in Aram, I made this vow: ‘If the Lord takes me back to Jerusalem, I will worship the Lord in Hebron. ’ ”
10015009 The king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he went to Hebron.
10015010 Then Absalom sent secret messengers throughout the tribes of Israel to say, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpets, then say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron.’ ”
10015011 Two hundred men from Jerusalem had accompanied Absalom. They had been invited as guests and went quite innocently, knowing nothing about the matter.
10015012 While Absalom was offering sacrifices, he also sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, to come from Giloh, his hometown. And so the conspiracy gained strength, and Absalom’s following kept on increasing.
10015013 A messenger came and told David, “The hearts of the people of Israel are with Absalom.”
10015014 Then David said to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem, “Come! We must flee, or none of us will escape from Absalom. We must leave immediately, or he will move quickly to overtake us and bring ruin on us and put the city to the sword.”
10015015 The king’s officials answered him, “Your servants are ready to do whatever our lord the king chooses.”
10015016 The king set out, with his entire household following him; but he left ten concubines to take care of the palace.
10015017 So the king set out, with all the people following him, and they halted at the edge of the city.
10015018 All his men marched past him, along with all the Kerethites and Pelethites; and all the six hundred Gittites who had accompanied him from Gath marched before the king.
10015019 The king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why should you come along with us? Go back and stay with King Absalom. You are a foreigner, an exile from your homeland.
10015020 You came only yesterday. And today shall I make you wander about with us, when I do not know where I am going? Go back, and take your people with you. May the Lord show you kindness and faithfulness.”
10015021 But Ittai replied to the king, “As surely as the Lord lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether it means life or death, there will your servant be.”
10015022 David said to Ittai, “Go ahead, march on.” So Ittai the Gittite marched on with all his men and the families that were with him.
10015023 The whole countryside wept aloud as all the people passed by. The king also crossed the Kidron Valley, and all the people moved on toward the wilderness.
10015024 Zadok was there, too, and all the Levites who were with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had finished leaving the city.
10015025 Then the king said to Zadok, “Take the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the Lord’s eyes, he will bring me back and let me see it and his dwelling place again.
10015026 But if he says, ‘I am not pleased with you,’ then I am ready; let him do to me whatever seems good to him.”
10015027 The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Do you understand? Go back to the city with my blessing. Take your son Ahimaaz with you, and also Abiathar’s son Jonathan. You and Abiathar return with your two sons.
10015028 I will wait at the fords in the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.”
10015029 So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem and stayed there.
10015030 But David continued up the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went; his head was covered and he was barefoot. All the people with him covered their heads too and were weeping as they went up.
10015031 Now David had been told, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” So David prayed, “Lord, turn Ahithophel’s counsel into foolishness.”
10015032 When David arrived at the summit, where people used to worship God, Hushai the Arkite was there to meet him, his robe torn and dust on his head.
10015033 David said to him, “If you go with me, you will be a burden to me.
10015034 But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, ‘Your Majesty, I will be your servant; I was your father’s servant in the past, but now I will be your servant,’ then you can help me by frustrating Ahithophel’s advice.
10015035 Won’t the priests Zadok and Abiathar be there with you? Tell them anything you hear in the king’s palace.
10015036 Their two sons, Ahimaaz son of Zadok and Jonathan son of Abiathar, are there with them. Send them to me with anything you hear.”
10015037 So Hushai, David’s confidant, arrived at Jerusalem as Absalom was entering the city.
10016001 When David had gone a short distance beyond the summit, there was Ziba, the steward of Mephibosheth, waiting to meet him. He had a string of donkeys saddled and loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred cakes of raisins, a hundred cakes of figs and a skin of wine.
10016002 The king asked Ziba, “Why have you brought these?” Ziba answered, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride on, the bread and fruit are for the men to eat, and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the wilderness.”
10016003 The king then asked, “Where is your master’s grandson?” Ziba said to him, “He is staying in Jerusalem, because he thinks, ‘Today the Israelites will restore to me my grandfather’s kingdom.’ ”
10016004 Then the king said to Ziba, “All that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours.” “I humbly bow,” Ziba said. “May I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king.”
10016005 As King David approached Bahurim, a man from the same clan as Saul’s family came out from there. His name was Shimei son of Gera, and he cursed as he came out.
10016006 He pelted David and all the king’s officials with stones, though all the troops and the special guard were on David’s right and left.
10016007 As he cursed, Shimei said, “Get out, get out, you murderer, you scoundrel!
10016008 The Lord has repaid you for all the blood you shed in the household of Saul, in whose place you have reigned. The Lord has given the kingdom into the hands of your son Absalom. You have come to ruin because you are a murderer!”
10016009 Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head.”
10016010 But the king said, “What does this have to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the Lord said to him, ‘Curse David,’ who can ask, ‘Why do you do this?’ ”
10016011 David then said to Abishai and all his officials, “My son, my own flesh and blood, is trying to kill me. How much more, then, this Benjamite! Leave him alone; let him curse, for the Lord has told him to.
10016012 It may be that the Lord will look upon my misery and restore to me his covenant blessing instead of his curse today.”
10016013 So David and his men continued along the road while Shimei was going along the hillside opposite him, cursing as he went and throwing stones at him and showering him with dirt.
10016014 The king and all the people with him arrived at their destination exhausted. And there he refreshed himself.
10016015 Meanwhile, Absalom and all the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him.
10016016 Then Hushai the Arkite, David’s confidant, went to Absalom and said to him, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”
10016017 Absalom said to Hushai, “So this is the love you show your friend? If he’s your friend, why didn’t you go with him?”
10016018 Hushai said to Absalom, “No, the one chosen by the Lord, by these people, and by all the men of Israel—his I will be, and I will remain with him.
10016019 Furthermore, whom should I serve? Should I not serve the son? Just as I served your father, so I will serve you.”
10016020 Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give us your advice. What should we do?”
10016021 Ahithophel answered, “Sleep with your father’s concubines whom he left to take care of the palace. Then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself obnoxious to your father, and the hands of everyone with you will be more resolute.”
10016022 So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he slept with his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.
10016023 Now in those days the advice Ahithophel gave was like that of one who inquires of God. That was how both David and Absalom regarded all of Ahithophel’s advice.
10017001 Ahithophel said to Absalom, “I would choose twelve thousand men and set out tonight in pursuit of David.
10017002 I would attack him while he is weary and weak. I would strike him with terror, and then all the people with him will flee. I would strike down only the king
10017003 and bring all the people back to you. The death of the man you seek will mean the return of all; all the people will be unharmed.”
10017004 This plan seemed good to Absalom and to all the elders of Israel.
10017005 But Absalom said, “Summon also Hushai the Arkite, so we can hear what he has to say as well.”
10017006 When Hushai came to him, Absalom said, “Ahithophel has given this advice. Should we do what he says? If not, give us your opinion.”
10017007 Hushai replied to Absalom, “The advice Ahithophel has given is not good this time.
10017008 You know your father and his men; they are fighters, and as fierce as a wild bear robbed of her cubs. Besides, your father is an experienced fighter; he will not spend the night with the troops.
10017009 Even now, he is hidden in a cave or some other place. If he should attack your troops first, whoever hears about it will say, ‘There has been a slaughter among the troops who follow Absalom.’
10017010 Then even the bravest soldier, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will melt with fear, for all Israel knows that your father is a fighter and that those with him are brave.
10017011 “So I advise you: Let all Israel, from Dan to Beersheba—as numerous as the sand on the seashore—be gathered to you, with you yourself leading them into battle.
10017012 Then we will attack him wherever he may be found, and we will fall on him as dew settles on the ground. Neither he nor any of his men will be left alive.
10017013 If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it down to the valley until not so much as a pebble is left.”
10017014 Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Arkite is better than that of Ahithophel.” For the Lord had determined to frustrate the good advice of Ahithophel in order to bring disaster on Absalom.
10017015 Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, “Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the elders of Israel to do such and such, but I have advised them to do so and so.
10017016 Now send a message at once and tell David, ‘Do not spend the night at the fords in the wilderness; cross over without fail, or the king and all the people with him will be swallowed up.’ ”
10017017 Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En Rogel. A female servant was to go and inform them, and they were to go and tell King David, for they could not risk being seen entering the city.
10017018 But a young man saw them and told Absalom. So the two of them left at once and went to the house of a man in Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard, and they climbed down into it.
10017019 His wife took a covering and spread it out over the opening of the well and scattered grain over it. No one knew anything about it.
10017020 When Absalom’s men came to the woman at the house, they asked, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” The woman answered them, “They crossed over the brook.” The men searched but found no one, so they returned to Jerusalem.
10017021 After they had gone, the two climbed out of the well and went to inform King David. They said to him, “Set out and cross the river at once; Ahithophel has advised such and such against you.”
10017022 So David and all the people with him set out and crossed the Jordan. By daybreak, no one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.
10017023 When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and set out for his house in his hometown. He put his house in order and then hanged himself. So he died and was buried in his father’s tomb.
10017024 David went to Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel.
10017025 Absalom had appointed Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Amasa was the son of Jether, an Ishmaelite who had married Abigail , the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah the mother of Joab.
10017026 The Israelites and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.
10017027 When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Makir son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim
10017028 brought bedding and bowls and articles of pottery. They also brought wheat and barley, flour and roasted grain, beans and lentils,
10017029 honey and curds, sheep, and cheese from cows’ milk for David and his people to eat. For they said, “The people have become exhausted and hungry and thirsty in the wilderness.”
10018001 David mustered the men who were with him and appointed over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.
10018002 David sent out his troops, a third under the command of Joab, a third under Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. The king told the troops, “I myself will surely march out with you.”
10018003 But the men said, “You must not go out; if we are forced to flee, they won’t care about us. Even if half of us die, they won’t care; but you are worth ten thousand of us. It would be better now for you to give us support from the city.”
10018004 The king answered, “I will do whatever seems best to you.” So the king stood beside the gate while all his men marched out in units of hundreds and of thousands.
10018005 The king commanded Joab, Abishai and Ittai, “Be gentle with the young man Absalom for my sake.” And all the troops heard the king giving orders concerning Absalom to each of the commanders.
10018006 David’s army marched out of the city to fight Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.
10018007 There Israel’s troops were routed by David’s men, and the casualties that day were great—twenty thousand men.
10018008 The battle spread out over the whole countryside, and the forest swallowed up more men that day than the sword.
10018009 Now Absalom happened to meet David’s men. He was riding his mule, and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak, Absalom’s hair got caught in the tree. He was left hanging in midair, while the mule he was riding kept on going.
10018010 When one of the men saw what had happened, he told Joab, “I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree.”
10018011 Joab said to the man who had told him this, “What! You saw him? Why didn’t you strike him to the ground right there? Then I would have had to give you ten shekels of silver and a warrior’s belt.”
10018012 But the man replied, “Even if a thousand shekels were weighed out into my hands, I would not lay a hand on the king’s son. In our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘Protect the young man Absalom for my sake. ’
10018013 And if I had put my life in jeopardy —and nothing is hidden from the king—you would have kept your distance from me.”
10018014 Joab said, “I’m not going to wait like this for you.” So he took three javelins in his hand and plunged them into Absalom’s heart while Absalom was still alive in the oak tree.
10018015 And ten of Joab’s armor-bearers surrounded Absalom, struck him and killed him.
10018016 Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and the troops stopped pursuing Israel, for Joab halted them.
10018017 They took Absalom, threw him into a big pit in the forest and piled up a large heap of rocks over him. Meanwhile, all the Israelites fled to their homes.
10018018 During his lifetime Absalom had taken a pillar and erected it in the King’s Valley as a monument to himself, for he thought, “I have no son to carry on the memory of my name.” He named the pillar after himself, and it is called Absalom’s Monument to this day.
10018019 Now Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, “Let me run and take the news to the king that the Lord has vindicated him by delivering him from the hand of his enemies.”
10018020 “You are not the one to take the news today,” Joab told him. “You may take the news another time, but you must not do so today, because the king’s son is dead.”
10018021 Then Joab said to a Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” The Cushite bowed down before Joab and ran off.
10018022 Ahimaaz son of Zadok again said to Joab, “Come what may, please let me run behind the Cushite.” But Joab replied, “My son, why do you want to go? You don’t have any news that will bring you a reward.”
10018023 He said, “Come what may, I want to run.” So Joab said, “Run!” Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and outran the Cushite.
10018024 While David was sitting between the inner and outer gates, the watchman went up to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked out, he saw a man running alone.
10018025 The watchman called out to the king and reported it. The king said, “If he is alone, he must have good news.” And the runner came closer and closer.
10018026 Then the watchman saw another runner, and he called down to the gatekeeper, “Look, another man running alone!” The king said, “He must be bringing good news, too.”
10018027 The watchman said, “It seems to me that the first one runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok.” “He’s a good man,” the king said. “He comes with good news.”
10018028 Then Ahimaaz called out to the king, “All is well!” He bowed down before the king with his face to the ground and said, “Praise be to the Lord your God! He has delivered up those who lifted their hands against my lord the king.”
10018029 The king asked, “Is the young man Absalom safe?” Ahimaaz answered, “I saw great confusion just as Joab was about to send the king’s servant and me, your servant, but I don’t know what it was.”
10018030 The king said, “Stand aside and wait here.” So he stepped aside and stood there.
10018031 Then the Cushite arrived and said, “My lord the king, hear the good news! The Lord has vindicated you today by delivering you from the hand of all who rose up against you.”
10018032 The king asked the Cushite, “Is the young man Absalom safe?” The Cushite replied, “May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up to harm you be like that young man.”
10018033 The king was shaken. He went up to the room over the gateway and wept. As he went, he said: “O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you—O Absalom, my son, my son!”
10019001 Joab was told, “The king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.”
10019002 And for the whole army the victory that day was turned into mourning, because on that day the troops heard it said, “The king is grieving for his son.”
10019003 The men stole into the city that day as men steal in who are ashamed when they flee from battle.
10019004 The king covered his face and cried aloud, “O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!”
10019005 Then Joab went into the house to the king and said, “Today you have humiliated all your men, who have just saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and the lives of your wives and concubines.
10019006 You love those who hate you and hate those who love you. You have made it clear today that the commanders and their men mean nothing to you. I see that you would be pleased if Absalom were alive today and all of us were dead.
10019007 Now go out and encourage your men. I swear by the Lord that if you don’t go out, not a man will be left with you by nightfall. This will be worse for you than all the calamities that have come on you from your youth till now.”
10019008 So the king got up and took his seat in the gateway. When the men were told, “The king is sitting in the gateway,” they all came before him. Meanwhile, the Israelites had fled to their homes.
10019009 Throughout the tribes of Israel, all the people were arguing among themselves, saying, “The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies; he is the one who rescued us from the hand of the Philistines. But now he has fled the country to escape from Absalom;
10019010 and Absalom, whom we anointed to rule over us, has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?”
10019011 King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests: “Ask the elders of Judah, ‘Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his palace, since what is being said throughout Israel has reached the king at his quarters?
10019012 You are my relatives, my own flesh and blood. So why should you be the last to bring back the king?’
10019013 And say to Amasa, ‘Are you not my own flesh and blood? May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you are not the commander of my army for life in place of Joab.’ ”
10019014 He won over the hearts of the men of Judah so that they were all of one mind. They sent word to the king, “Return, you and all your men.”
10019015 Then the king returned and went as far as the Jordan. Now the men of Judah had come to Gilgal to go out and meet the king and bring him across the Jordan.
10019016 Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David.
10019017 With him were a thousand Benjamites, along with Ziba, the steward of Saul’s household, and his fifteen sons and twenty servants. They rushed to the Jordan, where the king was.
10019018 They crossed at the ford to take the king’s household over and to do whatever he wished. When Shimei son of Gera crossed the Jordan, he fell prostrate before the king
10019019 and said to him, “May my lord not hold me guilty. Do not remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. May the king put it out of his mind.
10019020 For I your servant know that I have sinned, but today I have come here as the first from the tribes of Joseph to come down and meet my lord the king.”
10019021 Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said, “Shouldn’t Shimei be put to death for this? He cursed the Lord’s anointed.”
10019022 David replied, “What does this have to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? What right do you have to interfere? Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? Don’t I know that today I am king over Israel?”
10019023 So the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” And the king promised him on oath.
10019024 Mephibosheth, Saul’s grandson, also went down to meet the king. He had not taken care of his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned safely.
10019025 When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, “Why didn’t you go with me, Mephibosheth?”
10019026 He said, “My lord the king, since I your servant am lame, I said, ‘I will have my donkey saddled and will ride on it, so I can go with the king.’ But Ziba my servant betrayed me.
10019027 And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king. My lord the king is like an angel of God; so do whatever you wish.
10019028 All my grandfather’s descendants deserved nothing but death from my lord the king, but you gave your servant a place among those who eat at your table. So what right do I have to make any more appeals to the king?”
10019029 The king said to him, “Why say more? I order you and Ziba to divide the land.”
10019030 Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let him take everything, now that my lord the king has returned home safely.”
10019031 Barzillai the Gileadite also came down from Rogelim to cross the Jordan with the king and to send him on his way from there.
10019032 Now Barzillai was very old, eighty years of age. He had provided for the king during his stay in Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man.
10019033 The king said to Barzillai, “Cross over with me and stay with me in Jerusalem, and I will provide for you.”
10019034 But Barzillai answered the king, “How many more years will I live, that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king?
10019035 I am now eighty years old. Can I tell the difference between what is enjoyable and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats and drinks? Can I still hear the voices of male and female singers? Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?
10019036 Your servant will cross over the Jordan with the king for a short distance, but why should the king reward me in this way?
10019037 Let your servant return, that I may die in my own town near the tomb of my father and mother. But here is your servant Kimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king. Do for him whatever you wish.”
10019038 The king said, “Kimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him whatever you wish. And anything you desire from me I will do for you.”
10019039 So all the people crossed the Jordan, and then the king crossed over. The king kissed Barzillai and bid him farewell, and Barzillai returned to his home.
10019040 When the king crossed over to Gilgal, Kimham crossed with him. All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel had taken the king over.
10019041 Soon all the men of Israel were coming to the king and saying to him, “Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, steal the king away and bring him and his household across the Jordan, together with all his men?”
10019042 All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “We did this because the king is closely related to us. Why are you angry about it? Have we eaten any of the king’s provisions? Have we taken anything for ourselves?”
10019043 Then the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, “We have ten shares in the king; so we have a greater claim on David than you have. Why then do you treat us with contempt? Weren’t we the first to speak of bringing back our king?” But the men of Judah pressed their claims even more forcefully than the men of Israel.
10020001 Now a troublemaker named Sheba son of Bikri, a Benjamite, happened to be there. He sounded the trumpet and shouted, “We have no share in David, no part in Jesse’s son! Every man to his tent, Israel!”
10020002 So all the men of Israel deserted David to follow Sheba son of Bikri. But the men of Judah stayed by their king all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
10020003 When David returned to his palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines he had left to take care of the palace and put them in a house under guard. He provided for them but had no sexual relations with them. They were kept in confinement till the day of their death, living as widows.
10020004 Then the king said to Amasa, “Summon the men of Judah to come to me within three days, and be here yourself.”
10020005 But when Amasa went to summon Judah, he took longer than the time the king had set for him.
10020006 David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba son of Bikri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your master’s men and pursue him, or he will find fortified cities and escape from us.”
10020007 So Joab’s men and the Kerethites and Pelethites and all the mighty warriors went out under the command of Abishai. They marched out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bikri.
10020008 While they were at the great rock in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was wearing his military tunic, and strapped over it at his waist was a belt with a dagger in its sheath. As he stepped forward, it dropped out of its sheath.
10020009 Joab said to Amasa, “How are you, my brother?” Then Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
10020010 Amasa was not on his guard against the dagger in Joab’s hand, and Joab plunged it into his belly, and his intestines spilled out on the ground. Without being stabbed again, Amasa died. Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bikri.
10020011 One of Joab’s men stood beside Amasa and said, “Whoever favors Joab, and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab!”
10020012 Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road, and the man saw that all the troops came to a halt there. When he realized that everyone who came up to Amasa stopped, he dragged him from the road into a field and threw a garment over him.
10020013 After Amasa had been removed from the road, everyone went on with Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bikri.
10020014 Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel Beth Maakah and through the entire region of the Bikrites, who gathered together and followed him.
10020015 All the troops with Joab came and besieged Sheba in Abel Beth Maakah. They built a siege ramp up to the city, and it stood against the outer fortifications. While they were battering the wall to bring it down,
10020016 a wise woman called from the city, “Listen! Listen! Tell Joab to come here so I can speak to him.”
10020017 He went toward her, and she asked, “Are you Joab?” “I am,” he answered. She said, “Listen to what your servant has to say.” “I’m listening,” he said.
10020018 She continued, “Long ago they used to say, ‘Get your answer at Abel,’ and that settled it.
10020019 We are the peaceful and faithful in Israel. You are trying to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel. Why do you want to swallow up the Lord’s inheritance?”
10020020 “Far be it from me!” Joab replied, “Far be it from me to swallow up or destroy!
10020021 That is not the case. A man named Sheba son of Bikri, from the hill country of Ephraim, has lifted up his hand against the king, against David. Hand over this one man, and I’ll withdraw from the city.” The woman said to Joab, “His head will be thrown to you from the wall.”
10020022 Then the woman went to all the people with her wise advice, and they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bikri and threw it to Joab. So he sounded the trumpet, and his men dispersed from the city, each returning to his home. And Joab went back to the king in Jerusalem.
10020023 Joab was over Israel’s entire army; Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites;
10020024 Adoniram was in charge of forced labor; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder;
10020025 Sheva was secretary; Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
10020026 and Ira the Jairite was David’s priest.
10021001 During the reign of David, there was a famine for three successive years; so David sought the face of the Lord. The Lord said, “It is on account of Saul and his blood-stained house; it is because he put the Gibeonites to death.”
10021002 The king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not a part of Israel but were survivors of the Amorites; the Israelites had sworn to spare them, but Saul in his zeal for Israel and Judah had tried to annihilate them.)
10021003 David asked the Gibeonites, “What shall I do for you? How shall I make atonement so that you will bless the Lord’s inheritance?”
10021004 The Gibeonites answered him, “We have no right to demand silver or gold from Saul or his family, nor do we have the right to put anyone in Israel to death.” “What do you want me to do for you?” David asked.
10021005 They answered the king, “As for the man who destroyed us and plotted against us so that we have been decimated and have no place anywhere in Israel,
10021006 let seven of his male descendants be given to us to be killed and their bodies exposed before the Lord at Gibeah of Saul—the Lord’s chosen one.” So the king said, “I will give them to you.”
10021007 The king spared Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath before the Lord between David and Jonathan son of Saul.
10021008 But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Aiah’s daughter Rizpah, whom she had borne to Saul, together with the five sons of Saul’s daughter Merab, whom she had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite.
10021009 He handed them over to the Gibeonites, who killed them and exposed their bodies on a hill before the Lord. All seven of them fell together; they were put to death during the first days of the harvest, just as the barley harvest was beginning.
10021010 Rizpah daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning of the harvest till the rain poured down from the heavens on the bodies, she did not let the birds touch them by day or the wild animals by night.
10021011 When David was told what Aiah’s daughter Rizpah, Saul’s concubine, had done,
10021012 he went and took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the citizens of Jabesh Gilead. (They had stolen their bodies from the public square at Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hung them after they struck Saul down on Gilboa.)
10021013 David brought the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from there, and the bones of those who had been killed and exposed were gathered up.
10021014 They buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the tomb of Saul’s father Kish, at Zela in Benjamin, and did everything the king commanded. After that, God answered prayer in behalf of the land.
10021015 Once again there was a battle between the Philistines and Israel. David went down with his men to fight against the Philistines, and he became exhausted.
10021016 And Ishbi-Benob, one of the descendants of Rapha, whose bronze spearhead weighed three hundred shekels and who was armed with a new sword, said he would kill David.
10021017 But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to David’s rescue; he struck the Philistine down and killed him. Then David’s men swore to him, saying, “Never again will you go out with us to battle, so that the lamp of Israel will not be extinguished.”
10021018 In the course of time, there was another battle with the Philistines, at Gob. At that time Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Saph, one of the descendants of Rapha.
10021019 In another battle with the Philistines at Gob, Elhanan son of Jair the Bethlehemite killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite, who had a spear with a shaft like a weaver’s rod.
10021020 In still another battle, which took place at Gath, there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He also was descended from Rapha.
10021021 When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimeah, David’s brother, killed him.
10021022 These four were descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men.
10022001 David sang to the Lord the words of this song when the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.
10022002 He said: “The Lord is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer;
10022003 my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation. He is my stronghold, my refuge and my savior— from violent people you save me.
10022004 “I called to the Lord, who is worthy of praise, and have been saved from my enemies.
10022005 The waves of death swirled about me; the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.
10022006 The cords of the grave coiled around me; the snares of death confronted me.
10022007 “In my distress I called to the Lord; I called out to my God. From his temple he heard my voice; my cry came to his ears.
10022008 The earth trembled and quaked, the foundations of the heavens shook; they trembled because he was angry.
10022009 Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it.
10022010 He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under his feet.
10022011 He mounted the cherubim and flew; he soared on the wings of the wind.
10022012 He made darkness his canopy around him— the dark rain clouds of the sky.
10022013 Out of the brightness of his presence bolts of lightning blazed forth.
10022014 The Lord thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded.
10022015 He shot his arrows and scattered the enemy, with great bolts of lightning he routed them.
10022016 The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at the rebuke of the Lord, at the blast of breath from his nostrils.
10022017 “He reached down from on high and took hold of me; he drew me out of deep waters.
10022018 He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from my foes, who were too strong for me.
10022019 They confronted me in the day of my disaster, but the Lord was my support.
10022020 He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me.
10022021 “The Lord has dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.
10022022 For I have kept the ways of the Lord; I am not guilty of turning from my God.
10022023 All his laws are before me; I have not turned away from his decrees.
10022024 I have been blameless before him and have kept myself from sin.
10022025 The Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness in his sight.
10022026 “To the faithful you show yourself faithful, to the blameless you show yourself blameless,
10022027 to the pure you show yourself pure, but to the devious you show yourself shrewd.
10022028 You save the humble, but your eyes are on the haughty to bring them low.
10022029 You, Lord, are my lamp; the Lord turns my darkness into light.
10022030 With your help I can advance against a troop ; with my God I can scale a wall.
10022031 “As for God, his way is perfect: The Lord’s word is flawless; he shields all who take refuge in him.
10022032 For who is God besides the Lord? And who is the Rock except our God?
10022033 It is God who arms me with strength and keeps my way secure.
10022034 He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he causes me to stand on the heights.
10022035 He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
10022036 You make your saving help my shield; your help has made me great.
10022037 You provide a broad path for my feet, so that my ankles do not give way.
10022038 “I pursued my enemies and crushed them; I did not turn back till they were destroyed.
10022039 I crushed them completely, and they could not rise; they fell beneath my feet.
10022040 You armed me with strength for battle; you humbled my adversaries before me.
10022041 You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed my foes.
10022042 They cried for help, but there was no one to save them— to the Lord, but he did not answer.
10022043 I beat them as fine as the dust of the earth; I pounded and trampled them like mud in the streets.
10022044 “You have delivered me from the attacks of the peoples; you have preserved me as the head of nations. People I did not know now serve me,
10022045 foreigners cower before me; as soon as they hear of me, they obey me.
10022046 They all lose heart; they come trembling from their strongholds.
10022047 “The Lord lives! Praise be to my Rock! Exalted be my God, the Rock, my Savior!
10022048 He is the God who avenges me, who puts the nations under me,
10022049 who sets me free from my enemies. You exalted me above my foes; from a violent man you rescued me.
10022050 Therefore I will praise you, Lord, among the nations; I will sing the praises of your name.
10022051 “He gives his king great victories; he shows unfailing kindness to his anointed, to David and his descendants forever.”
10023001 These are the last words of David: “The inspired utterance of David son of Jesse, the utterance of the man exalted by the Most High, the man anointed by the God of Jacob, the hero of Israel’s songs:
10023002 “The Spirit of the Lord spoke through me; his word was on my tongue.
10023003 The God of Israel spoke, the Rock of Israel said to me: ‘When one rules over people in righteousness, when he rules in the fear of God,
10023004 he is like the light of morning at sunrise on a cloudless morning, like the brightness after rain that brings grass from the earth.’
10023005 “If my house were not right with God, surely he would not have made with me an everlasting covenant, arranged and secured in every part; surely he would not bring to fruition my salvation and grant me my every desire.
10023006 But evil men are all to be cast aside like thorns, which are not gathered with the hand.
10023007 Whoever touches thorns uses a tool of iron or the shaft of a spear; they are burned up where they lie.”
10023008 These are the names of David’s mighty warriors: Josheb-Basshebeth, a Tahkemonite, was chief of the Three; he raised his spear against eight hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter.
10023009 Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite. As one of the three mighty warriors, he was with David when they taunted the Philistines gathered at Pas Dammim for battle. Then the Israelites retreated,
10023010 but Eleazar stood his ground and struck down the Philistines till his hand grew tired and froze to the sword. The Lord brought about a great victory that day. The troops returned to Eleazar, but only to strip the dead.
10023011 Next to him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines banded together at a place where there was a field full of lentils, Israel’s troops fled from them.
10023012 But Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field. He defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the Lord brought about a great victory.
10023013 During harvest time, three of the thirty chief warriors came down to David at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
10023014 At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.
10023015 David longed for water and said, “Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!”
10023016 So the three mighty warriors broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the Lord.
10023017 “Far be it from me, Lord, to do this!” he said. “Is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives?” And David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty warriors.
10023018 Abishai the brother of Joab son of Zeruiah was chief of the Three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three.
10023019 Was he not held in greater honor than the Three? He became their commander, even though he was not included among them.
10023020 Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, performed great exploits. He struck down Moab’s two mightiest warriors. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.
10023021 And he struck down a huge Egyptian. Although the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear.
10023022 Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty warriors.
10023023 He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
10023024 Among the Thirty were: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem,
10023025 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
10023026 Helez the Paltite, Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa,
10023027 Abiezer from Anathoth, Sibbekai the Hushathite,
10023028 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
10023029 Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah in Benjamin,
10023030 Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai from the ravines of Gaash,
10023031 Abi-Albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
10023032 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan
10023033 son of Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam son of Sharar the Hararite,
10023034 Eliphelet son of Ahasbai the Maakathite, Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
10023035 Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
10023036 Igal son of Nathan from Zobah, the son of Hagri,
10023037 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah,
10023038 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite
10023039 and Uriah the Hittite. There were thirty-seven in all.
10024001 Again the anger of the Lord burned against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, “Go and take a census of Israel and Judah.”
10024002 So the king said to Joab and the army commanders with him, “Go throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and enroll the fighting men, so that I may know how many there are.”
10024003 But Joab replied to the king, “May the Lord your God multiply the troops a hundred times over, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?”
10024004 The king’s word, however, overruled Joab and the army commanders; so they left the presence of the king to enroll the fighting men of Israel.
10024005 After crossing the Jordan, they camped near Aroer, south of the town in the gorge, and then went through Gad and on to Jazer.
10024006 They went to Gilead and the region of Tahtim Hodshi, and on to Dan Jaan and around toward Sidon.
10024007 Then they went toward the fortress of Tyre and all the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites. Finally, they went on to Beersheba in the Negev of Judah.
10024008 After they had gone through the entire land, they came back to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
10024009 Joab reported the number of the fighting men to the king: In Israel there were eight hundred thousand able-bodied men who could handle a sword, and in Judah five hundred thousand.
10024010 David was conscience-stricken after he had counted the fighting men, and he said to the Lord, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done. Now, Lord, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing.”
10024011 Before David got up the next morning, the word of the Lord had come to Gad the prophet, David’s seer:
10024012 “Go and tell David, ‘This is what the Lord says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.’ ”
10024013 So Gad went to David and said to him, “Shall there come on you three years of famine in your land? Or three months of fleeing from your enemies while they pursue you? Or three days of plague in your land? Now then, think it over and decide how I should answer the one who sent me.”
10024014 David said to Gad, “I am in deep distress. Let us fall into the hands of the Lord, for his mercy is great; but do not let me fall into human hands.”
10024015 So the Lord sent a plague on Israel from that morning until the end of the time designated, and seventy thousand of the people from Dan to Beersheba died.
10024016 When the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the Lord relented concerning the disaster and said to the angel who was afflicting the people, “Enough! Withdraw your hand.” The angel of the Lord was then at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
10024017 When David saw the angel who was striking down the people, he said to the Lord, “I have sinned; I, the shepherd, have done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? Let your hand fall on me and my family.”
10024018 On that day Gad went to David and said to him, “Go up and build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”
10024019 So David went up, as the Lord had commanded through Gad.
10024020 When Araunah looked and saw the king and his officials coming toward him, he went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground.
10024021 Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” “To buy your threshing floor,” David answered, “so I can build an altar to the Lord, that the plague on the people may be stopped.”
10024022 Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take whatever he wishes and offer it up. Here are oxen for the burnt offering, and here are threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood.
10024023 Your Majesty, Araunah gives all this to the king.” Araunah also said to him, “May the Lord your God accept you.”
10024024 But the king replied to Araunah, “No, I insist on paying you for it. I will not sacrifice to the Lord my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen and paid fifty shekels of silver for them.
10024025 David built an altar to the Lord there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then the Lord answered his prayer in behalf of the land, and the plague on Israel was stopped.
11001001 When King David was very old, he could not keep warm even when they put covers over him.
11001002 So his attendants said to him, “Let us look for a young virgin to serve the king and take care of him. She can lie beside him so that our lord the king may keep warm.”
11001003 Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful young woman and found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
11001004 The woman was very beautiful; she took care of the king and waited on him, but the king had no sexual relations with her.
11001005 Now Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, put himself forward and said, “I will be king.” So he got chariots and horses ready, with fifty men to run ahead of him.
11001006 (His father had never rebuked him by asking, “Why do you behave as you do?” He was also very handsome and was born next after Absalom.)
11001007 Adonijah conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they gave him their support.
11001008 But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei and Rei and David’s special guard did not join Adonijah.
11001009 Adonijah then sacrificed sheep, cattle and fattened calves at the Stone of Zoheleth near En Rogel. He invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the royal officials of Judah,
11001010 but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the special guard or his brother Solomon.
11001011 Then Nathan asked Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother, “Have you not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has become king, and our lord David knows nothing about it?
11001012 Now then, let me advise you how you can save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.
11001013 Go in to King David and say to him, ‘My lord the king, did you not swear to me your servant: “Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne”? Why then has Adonijah become king?’
11001014 While you are still there talking to the king, I will come in and add my word to what you have said.”
11001015 So Bathsheba went to see the aged king in his room, where Abishag the Shunammite was attending him.
11001016 Bathsheba bowed down, prostrating herself before the king. “What is it you want?” the king asked.
11001017 She said to him, “My lord, you yourself swore to me your servant by the Lord your God: ‘Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne.’
11001018 But now Adonijah has become king, and you, my lord the king, do not know about it.
11001019 He has sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep, and has invited all the king’s sons, Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army, but he has not invited Solomon your servant.
11001020 My lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to learn from you who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
11001021 Otherwise, as soon as my lord the king is laid to rest with his ancestors, I and my son Solomon will be treated as criminals.”
11001022 While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived.
11001023 And the king was told, “Nathan the prophet is here.” So he went before the king and bowed with his face to the ground.
11001024 Nathan said, “Have you, my lord the king, declared that Adonijah shall be king after you, and that he will sit on your throne?
11001025 Today he has gone down and sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep. He has invited all the king’s sons, the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest. Right now they are eating and drinking with him and saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’
11001026 But me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon he did not invite.
11001027 Is this something my lord the king has done without letting his servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”
11001028 Then King David said, “Call in Bathsheba.” So she came into the king’s presence and stood before him.
11001029 The king then took an oath: “As surely as the Lord lives, who has delivered me out of every trouble,
11001030 I will surely carry out this very day what I swore to you by the Lord, the God of Israel: Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne in my place.”
11001031 Then Bathsheba bowed down with her face to the ground, prostrating herself before the king, and said, “May my lord King David live forever!”
11001032 King David said, “Call in Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet and Benaiah son of Jehoiada.” When they came before the king,
11001033 he said to them: “Take your lord’s servants with you and have Solomon my son mount my own mule and take him down to Gihon.
11001034 There have Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel. Blow the trumpet and shout, ‘Long live King Solomon!’
11001035 Then you are to go up with him, and he is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place. I have appointed him ruler over Israel and Judah.”
11001036 Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king, “Amen! May the Lord, the God of my lord the king, so declare it.
11001037 As the Lord was with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon to make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord King David!”
11001038 So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon mount King David’s mule, and they escorted him to Gihon.
11001039 Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the sacred tent and anointed Solomon. Then they sounded the trumpet and all the people shouted, “Long live King Solomon!”
11001040 And all the people went up after him, playing pipes and rejoicing greatly, so that the ground shook with the sound.
11001041 Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they were finishing their feast. On hearing the sound of the trumpet, Joab asked, “What’s the meaning of all the noise in the city?”
11001042 Even as he was speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. Adonijah said, “Come in. A worthy man like you must be bringing good news.”
11001043 “Not at all!” Jonathan answered. “Our lord King David has made Solomon king.
11001044 The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and they have put him on the king’s mule,
11001045 and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon. From there they have gone up cheering, and the city resounds with it. That’s the noise you hear.
11001046 Moreover, Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne.
11001047 Also, the royal officials have come to congratulate our lord King David, saying, ‘May your God make Solomon’s name more famous than yours and his throne greater than yours!’ And the king bowed in worship on his bed
11001048 and said, ‘Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who has allowed my eyes to see a successor on my throne today.’ ”
11001049 At this, all Adonijah’s guests rose in alarm and dispersed.
11001050 But Adonijah, in fear of Solomon, went and took hold of the horns of the altar.
11001051 Then Solomon was told, “Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon and is clinging to the horns of the altar. He says, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.’ ”
11001052 Solomon replied, “If he shows himself to be worthy, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground; but if evil is found in him, he will die.”
11001053 Then King Solomon sent men, and they brought him down from the altar. And Adonijah came and bowed down to King Solomon, and Solomon said, “Go to your home.”
11002001 When the time drew near for David to die, he gave a charge to Solomon his son.
11002002 “I am about to go the way of all the earth,” he said. “So be strong, act like a man,
11002003 and observe what the Lord your God requires: Walk in obedience to him, and keep his decrees and commands, his laws and regulations, as written in the Law of Moses. Do this so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you go
11002004 and that the Lord may keep his promise to me: ‘If your descendants watch how they live, and if they walk faithfully before me with all their heart and soul, you will never fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel.’
11002005 “Now you yourself know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me—what he did to the two commanders of Israel’s armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He killed them, shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle, and with that blood he stained the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet.
11002006 Deal with him according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace.
11002007 “But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table. They stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom.
11002008 “And remember, you have with you Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, who called down bitter curses on me the day I went to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the Lord: ‘I will not put you to death by the sword.’
11002009 But now, do not consider him innocent. You are a man of wisdom; you will know what to do to him. Bring his gray head down to the grave in blood.”
11002010 Then David rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David.
11002011 He had reigned forty years over Israel—seven years in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem.
11002012 So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his rule was firmly established.
11002013 Now Adonijah, the son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother. Bathsheba asked him, “Do you come peacefully?” He answered, “Yes, peacefully.”
11002014 Then he added, “I have something to say to you.” “You may say it,” she replied.
11002015 “As you know,” he said, “the kingdom was mine. All Israel looked to me as their king. But things changed, and the kingdom has gone to my brother; for it has come to him from the Lord.
11002016 Now I have one request to make of you. Do not refuse me.” “You may make it,” she said.
11002017 So he continued, “Please ask King Solomon—he will not refuse you—to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.”
11002018 “Very well,” Bathsheba replied, “I will speak to the king for you.”
11002019 When Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah, the king stood up to meet her, bowed down to her and sat down on his throne. He had a throne brought for the king’s mother, and she sat down at his right hand.
11002020 “I have one small request to make of you,” she said. “Do not refuse me.” The king replied, “Make it, my mother; I will not refuse you.”
11002021 So she said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given in marriage to your brother Adonijah.”
11002022 King Solomon answered his mother, “Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? You might as well request the kingdom for him—after all, he is my older brother—yes, for him and for Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah!”
11002023 Then King Solomon swore by the Lord: “May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if Adonijah does not pay with his life for this request!
11002024 And now, as surely as the Lord lives—he who has established me securely on the throne of my father David and has founded a dynasty for me as he promised—Adonijah shall be put to death today!”
11002025 So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck down Adonijah and he died.
11002026 To Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go back to your fields in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not put you to death now, because you carried the ark of the Sovereign Lord before my father David and shared all my father’s hardships.”
11002027 So Solomon removed Abiathar from the priesthood of the Lord, fulfilling the word the Lord had spoken at Shiloh about the house of Eli.
11002028 When the news reached Joab, who had conspired with Adonijah though not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the Lord and took hold of the horns of the altar.
11002029 King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the tent of the Lord and was beside the altar. Then Solomon ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada, “Go, strike him down!”
11002030 So Benaiah entered the tent of the Lord and said to Joab, “The king says, ‘Come out!’ ” But he answered, “No, I will die here.” Benaiah reported to the king, “This is how Joab answered me.”
11002031 Then the king commanded Benaiah, “Do as he says. Strike him down and bury him, and so clear me and my whole family of the guilt of the innocent blood that Joab shed.
11002032 The Lord will repay him for the blood he shed, because without my father David knowing it he attacked two men and killed them with the sword. Both of them—Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel’s army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah’s army—were better men and more upright than he.
11002033 May the guilt of their blood rest on the head of Joab and his descendants forever. But on David and his descendants, his house and his throne, may there be the Lord’s peace forever.”
11002034 So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck down Joab and killed him, and he was buried at his home out in the country.
11002035 The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab’s position and replaced Abiathar with Zadok the priest.
11002036 Then the king sent for Shimei and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but do not go anywhere else.
11002037 The day you leave and cross the Kidron Valley, you can be sure you will die; your blood will be on your own head.”
11002038 Shimei answered the king, “What you say is good. Your servant will do as my lord the king has said.” And Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a long time.
11002039 But three years later, two of Shimei’s slaves ran off to Achish son of Maakah, king of Gath, and Shimei was told, “Your slaves are in Gath.”
11002040 At this, he saddled his donkey and went to Achish at Gath in search of his slaves. So Shimei went away and brought the slaves back from Gath.
11002041 When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned,
11002042 the king summoned Shimei and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the Lord and warn you, ‘On the day you leave to go anywhere else, you can be sure you will die’? At that time you said to me, ‘What you say is good. I will obey.’
11002043 Why then did you not keep your oath to the Lord and obey the command I gave you?”
11002044 The king also said to Shimei, “You know in your heart all the wrong you did to my father David. Now the Lord will repay you for your wrongdoing.
11002045 But King Solomon will be blessed, and David’s throne will remain secure before the Lord forever.”
11002046 Then the king gave the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down and he died. The kingdom was now established in Solomon’s hands.
11003001 Solomon made an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt and married his daughter. He brought her to the City of David until he finished building his palace and the temple of the Lord, and the wall around Jerusalem.
11003002 The people, however, were still sacrificing at the high places, because a temple had not yet been built for the Name of the Lord.
11003003 Solomon showed his love for the Lord by walking according to the instructions given him by his father David, except that he offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places.
11003004 The king went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices, for that was the most important high place, and Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.
11003005 At Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon during the night in a dream, and God said, “Ask for whatever you want me to give you.”
11003006 Solomon answered, “You have shown great kindness to your servant, my father David, because he was faithful to you and righteous and upright in heart. You have continued this great kindness to him and have given him a son to sit on his throne this very day.
11003007 “Now, Lord my God, you have made your servant king in place of my father David. But I am only a little child and do not know how to carry out my duties.
11003008 Your servant is here among the people you have chosen, a great people, too numerous to count or number.
11003009 So give your servant a discerning heart to govern your people and to distinguish between right and wrong. For who is able to govern this great people of yours?”
11003010 The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for this.
11003011 So God said to him, “Since you have asked for this and not for long life or wealth for yourself, nor have asked for the death of your enemies but for discernment in administering justice,
11003012 I will do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and discerning heart, so that there will never have been anyone like you, nor will there ever be.
11003013 Moreover, I will give you what you have not asked for—both wealth and honor—so that in your lifetime you will have no equal among kings.
11003014 And if you walk in obedience to me and keep my decrees and commands as David your father did, I will give you a long life.”
11003015 Then Solomon awoke—and he realized it had been a dream. He returned to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the Lord’s covenant and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then he gave a feast for all his court.
11003016 Now two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him.
11003017 One of them said, “Pardon me, my lord. This woman and I live in the same house, and I had a baby while she was there with me.
11003018 The third day after my child was born, this woman also had a baby. We were alone; there was no one in the house but the two of us.
11003019 “During the night this woman’s son died because she lay on him.
11003020 So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while I your servant was asleep. She put him by her breast and put her dead son by my breast.
11003021 The next morning, I got up to nurse my son—and he was dead! But when I looked at him closely in the morning light, I saw that it wasn’t the son I had borne.”
11003022 The other woman said, “No! The living one is my son; the dead one is yours.” But the first one insisted, “No! The dead one is yours; the living one is mine.” And so they argued before the king.
11003023 The king said, “This one says, ‘My son is alive and your son is dead,’ while that one says, ‘No! Your son is dead and mine is alive.’ ”
11003024 Then the king said, “Bring me a sword.” So they brought a sword for the king.
11003025 He then gave an order: “Cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other.”
11003026 The woman whose son was alive was deeply moved out of love for her son and said to the king, “Please, my lord, give her the living baby! Don’t kill him!” But the other said, “Neither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two!”
11003027 Then the king gave his ruling: “Give the living baby to the first woman. Do not kill him; she is his mother.”
11003028 When all Israel heard the verdict the king had given, they held the king in awe, because they saw that he had wisdom from God to administer justice.
11004001 So King Solomon ruled over all Israel.
11004002 And these were his chief officials: Azariah son of Zadok—the priest;
11004003 Elihoreph and Ahijah, sons of Shisha—secretaries; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud—recorder;
11004004 Benaiah son of Jehoiada—commander in chief; Zadok and Abiathar—priests;
11004005 Azariah son of Nathan—in charge of the district governors; Zabud son of Nathan—a priest and adviser to the king;
11004006 Ahishar—palace administrator; Adoniram son of Abda—in charge of forced labor.
11004007 Solomon had twelve district governors over all Israel, who supplied provisions for the king and the royal household. Each one had to provide supplies for one month in the year.
11004008 These are their names: Ben-Hur—in the hill country of Ephraim;
11004009 Ben-Deker—in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh and Elon Bethhanan;
11004010 Ben-Hesed—in Arubboth (Sokoh and all the land of Hepher were his);
11004011 Ben-Abinadab—in Naphoth Dor (he was married to Taphath daughter of Solomon);
11004012 Baana son of Ahilud—in Taanach and Megiddo, and in all of Beth Shan next to Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth Shan to Abel Meholah across to Jokmeam;
11004013 Ben-Geber—in Ramoth Gilead (the settlements of Jair son of Manasseh in Gilead were his, as well as the region of Argob in Bashan and its sixty large walled cities with bronze gate bars);
11004014 Ahinadab son of Iddo—in Mahanaim;
11004015 Ahimaaz—in Naphtali (he had married Basemath daughter of Solomon);
11004016 Baana son of Hushai—in Asher and in Aloth;
11004017 Jehoshaphat son of Paruah—in Issachar;
11004018 Shimei son of Ela—in Benjamin;
11004019 Geber son of Uri—in Gilead (the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and the country of Og king of Bashan). He was the only governor over the district.
11004020 The people of Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand on the seashore; they ate, they drank and they were happy.
11004021 And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. These countries brought tribute and were Solomon’s subjects all his life.
11004022 Solomon’s daily provisions were thirty cors of the finest flour and sixty cors of meal,
11004023 ten head of stall-fed cattle, twenty of pasture-fed cattle and a hundred sheep and goats, as well as deer, gazelles, roebucks and choice fowl.
11004024 For he ruled over all the kingdoms west of the Euphrates River, from Tiphsah to Gaza, and had peace on all sides.
11004025 During Solomon’s lifetime Judah and Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, lived in safety, everyone under their own vine and under their own fig tree.
11004026 Solomon had four thousand stalls for chariot horses, and twelve thousand horses.
11004027 The district governors, each in his month, supplied provisions for King Solomon and all who came to the king’s table. They saw to it that nothing was lacking.
11004028 They also brought to the proper place their quotas of barley and straw for the chariot horses and the other horses.
11004029 God gave Solomon wisdom and very great insight, and a breadth of understanding as measureless as the sand on the seashore.
11004030 Solomon’s wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the people of the East, and greater than all the wisdom of Egypt.
11004031 He was wiser than anyone else, including Ethan the Ezrahite—wiser than Heman, Kalkol and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame spread to all the surrounding nations.
11004032 He spoke three thousand proverbs and his songs numbered a thousand and five.
11004033 He spoke about plant life, from the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of walls. He also spoke about animals and birds, reptiles and fish.
11004034 From all nations people came to listen to Solomon’s wisdom, sent by all the kings of the world, who had heard of his wisdom.
11005001 When Hiram king of Tyre heard that Solomon had been anointed king to succeed his father David, he sent his envoys to Solomon, because he had always been on friendly terms with David.
11005002 Solomon sent back this message to Hiram:
11005003 “You know that because of the wars waged against my father David from all sides, he could not build a temple for the Name of the Lord his God until the Lord put his enemies under his feet.
11005004 But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side, and there is no adversary or disaster.
11005005 I intend, therefore, to build a temple for the Name of the Lord my God, as the Lord told my father David, when he said, ‘Your son whom I will put on the throne in your place will build the temple for my Name.’
11005006 “So give orders that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me. My men will work with yours, and I will pay you for your men whatever wages you set. You know that we have no one so skilled in felling timber as the Sidonians.”
11005007 When Hiram heard Solomon’s message, he was greatly pleased and said, “Praise be to the Lord today, for he has given David a wise son to rule over this great nation.”
11005008 So Hiram sent word to Solomon: “I have received the message you sent me and will do all you want in providing the cedar and juniper logs.
11005009 My men will haul them down from Lebanon to the Mediterranean Sea, and I will float them as rafts by sea to the place you specify. There I will separate them and you can take them away. And you are to grant my wish by providing food for my royal household.”
11005010 In this way Hiram kept Solomon supplied with all the cedar and juniper logs he wanted,
11005011 and Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand cors of wheat as food for his household, in addition to twenty thousand baths of pressed olive oil. Solomon continued to do this for Hiram year after year.
11005012 The Lord gave Solomon wisdom, just as he had promised him. There were peaceful relations between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty.
11005013 King Solomon conscripted laborers from all Israel—thirty thousand men.
11005014 He sent them off to Lebanon in shifts of ten thousand a month, so that they spent one month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor.
11005015 Solomon had seventy thousand carriers and eighty thousand stonecutters in the hills,
11005016 as well as thirty-three hundred foremen who supervised the project and directed the workers.
11005017 At the king’s command they removed from the quarry large blocks of high-grade stone to provide a foundation of dressed stone for the temple.
11005018 The craftsmen of Solomon and Hiram and workers from Byblos cut and prepared the timber and stone for the building of the temple.
11006001 In the four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites came out of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, the second month, he began to build the temple of the Lord.
11006002 The temple that King Solomon built for the Lord was sixty cubits long, twenty wide and thirty high.
11006003 The portico at the front of the main hall of the temple extended the width of the temple, that is twenty cubits, and projected ten cubits from the front of the temple.
11006004 He made narrow windows high up in the temple walls.
11006005 Against the walls of the main hall and inner sanctuary he built a structure around the building, in which there were side rooms.
11006006 The lowest floor was five cubits wide, the middle floor six cubits and the third floor seven. He made offset ledges around the outside of the temple so that nothing would be inserted into the temple walls.
11006007 In building the temple, only blocks dressed at the quarry were used, and no hammer, chisel or any other iron tool was heard at the temple site while it was being built.
11006008 The entrance to the lowest floor was on the south side of the temple; a stairway led up to the middle level and from there to the third.
11006009 So he built the temple and completed it, roofing it with beams and cedar planks.
11006010 And he built the side rooms all along the temple. The height of each was five cubits, and they were attached to the temple by beams of cedar.
11006011 The word of the Lord came to Solomon:
11006012 “As for this temple you are building, if you follow my decrees, observe my laws and keep all my commands and obey them, I will fulfill through you the promise I gave to David your father.
11006013 And I will live among the Israelites and will not abandon my people Israel.”
11006014 So Solomon built the temple and completed it.
11006015 He lined its interior walls with cedar boards, paneling them from the floor of the temple to the ceiling, and covered the floor of the temple with planks of juniper.
11006016 He partitioned off twenty cubits at the rear of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling to form within the temple an inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place.
11006017 The main hall in front of this room was forty cubits long.
11006018 The inside of the temple was cedar, carved with gourds and open flowers. Everything was cedar; no stone was to be seen.
11006019 He prepared the inner sanctuary within the temple to set the ark of the covenant of the Lord there.
11006020 The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty wide and twenty high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold, and he also overlaid the altar of cedar.
11006021 Solomon covered the inside of the temple with pure gold, and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, which was overlaid with gold.
11006022 So he overlaid the whole interior with gold. He also overlaid with gold the altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary.
11006023 For the inner sanctuary he made a pair of cherubim out of olive wood, each ten cubits high.
11006024 One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing five cubits—ten cubits from wing tip to wing tip.
11006025 The second cherub also measured ten cubits, for the two cherubim were identical in size and shape.
11006026 The height of each cherub was ten cubits.
11006027 He placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple, with their wings spread out. The wing of one cherub touched one wall, while the wing of the other touched the other wall, and their wings touched each other in the middle of the room.
11006028 He overlaid the cherubim with gold.
11006029 On the walls all around the temple, in both the inner and outer rooms, he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers.
11006030 He also covered the floors of both the inner and outer rooms of the temple with gold.
11006031 For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors out of olive wood that were one fifth of the width of the sanctuary.
11006032 And on the two olive-wood doors he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid the cherubim and palm trees with hammered gold.
11006033 In the same way, for the entrance to the main hall he made doorframes out of olive wood that were one fourth of the width of the hall.
11006034 He also made two doors out of juniper wood, each having two leaves that turned in sockets.
11006035 He carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers on them and overlaid them with gold hammered evenly over the carvings.
11006036 And he built the inner courtyard of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams.
11006037 The foundation of the temple of the Lord was laid in the fourth year, in the month of Ziv.
11006038 In the eleventh year in the month of Bul, the eighth month, the temple was finished in all its details according to its specifications. He had spent seven years building it.
11007001 It took Solomon thirteen years, however, to complete the construction of his palace.
11007002 He built the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon a hundred cubits long, fifty wide and thirty high, with four rows of cedar columns supporting trimmed cedar beams.
11007003 It was roofed with cedar above the beams that rested on the columns—forty-five beams, fifteen to a row.
11007004 Its windows were placed high in sets of three, facing each other.
11007005 All the doorways had rectangular frames; they were in the front part in sets of three, facing each other.
11007006 He made a colonnade fifty cubits long and thirty wide. In front of it was a portico, and in front of that were pillars and an overhanging roof.
11007007 He built the throne hall, the Hall of Justice, where he was to judge, and he covered it with cedar from floor to ceiling.
11007008 And the palace in which he was to live, set farther back, was similar in design. Solomon also made a palace like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had married.
11007009 All these structures, from the outside to the great courtyard and from foundation to eaves, were made of blocks of high-grade stone cut to size and smoothed on their inner and outer faces.
11007010 The foundations were laid with large stones of good quality, some measuring ten cubits and some eight.
11007011 Above were high-grade stones, cut to size, and cedar beams.
11007012 The great courtyard was surrounded by a wall of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams, as was the inner courtyard of the temple of the Lord with its portico.
11007013 King Solomon sent to Tyre and brought Huram,
11007014 whose mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali and whose father was from Tyre and a skilled craftsman in bronze. Huram was filled with wisdom, with understanding and with knowledge to do all kinds of bronze work. He came to King Solomon and did all the work assigned to him.
11007015 He cast two bronze pillars, each eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference.
11007016 He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; each capital was five cubits high.
11007017 A network of interwoven chains adorned the capitals on top of the pillars, seven for each capital.
11007018 He made pomegranates in two rows encircling each network to decorate the capitals on top of the pillars. He did the same for each capital.
11007019 The capitals on top of the pillars in the portico were in the shape of lilies, four cubits high.
11007020 On the capitals of both pillars, above the bowl-shaped part next to the network, were the two hundred pomegranates in rows all around.
11007021 He erected the pillars at the portico of the temple. The pillar to the south he named Jakin and the one to the north Boaz.
11007022 The capitals on top were in the shape of lilies. And so the work on the pillars was completed.
11007023 He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it.
11007024 Below the rim, gourds encircled it—ten to a cubit. The gourds were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea.
11007025 The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center.
11007026 It was a handbreadth in thickness, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held two thousand baths.
11007027 He also made ten movable stands of bronze; each was four cubits long, four wide and three high.
11007028 This is how the stands were made: They had side panels attached to uprights.
11007029 On the panels between the uprights were lions, bulls and cherubim—and on the uprights as well. Above and below the lions and bulls were wreaths of hammered work.
11007030 Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and each had a basin resting on four supports, cast with wreaths on each side.
11007031 On the inside of the stand there was an opening that had a circular frame one cubit deep. This opening was round, and with its basework it measured a cubit and a half. Around its opening there was engraving. The panels of the stands were square, not round.
11007032 The four wheels were under the panels, and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand. The diameter of each wheel was a cubit and a half.
11007033 The wheels were made like chariot wheels; the axles, rims, spokes and hubs were all of cast metal.
11007034 Each stand had four handles, one on each corner, projecting from the stand.
11007035 At the top of the stand there was a circular band half a cubit deep. The supports and panels were attached to the top of the stand.
11007036 He engraved cherubim, lions and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and on the panels, in every available space, with wreaths all around.
11007037 This is the way he made the ten stands. They were all cast in the same molds and were identical in size and shape.
11007038 He then made ten bronze basins, each holding forty baths and measuring four cubits across, one basin to go on each of the ten stands.
11007039 He placed five of the stands on the south side of the temple and five on the north. He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner of the temple.
11007040 He also made the pots and shovels and sprinkling bowls. So Huram finished all the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the temple of the Lord:
11007041 the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; the two sets of network decorating the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;
11007042 the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars);
11007043 the ten stands with their ten basins;
11007044 the Sea and the twelve bulls under it;
11007045 the pots, shovels and sprinkling bowls. All these objects that Huram made for King Solomon for the temple of the Lord were of burnished bronze.
11007046 The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Sukkoth and Zarethan.
11007047 Solomon left all these things unweighed, because there were so many; the weight of the bronze was not determined.
11007048 Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in the Lord’s temple: the golden altar; the golden table on which was the bread of the Presence;
11007049 the lampstands of pure gold (five on the right and five on the left, in front of the inner sanctuary); the gold floral work and lamps and tongs;
11007050 the pure gold basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers; and the gold sockets for the doors of the innermost room, the Most Holy Place, and also for the doors of the main hall of the temple.
11007051 When all the work King Solomon had done for the temple of the Lord was finished, he brought in the things his father David had dedicated—the silver and gold and the furnishings—and he placed them in the treasuries of the Lord’s temple.
11008001 Then King Solomon summoned into his presence at Jerusalem the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite families, to bring up the ark of the Lord’s covenant from Zion, the City of David.
11008002 All the Israelites came together to King Solomon at the time of the festival in the month of Ethanim, the seventh month.
11008003 When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the priests took up the ark,
11008004 and they brought up the ark of the Lord and the tent of meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. The priests and Levites carried them up,
11008005 and King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted.
11008006 The priests then brought the ark of the Lord’s covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim.
11008007 The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its carrying poles.
11008008 These poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are still there today.
11008009 There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt.
11008010 When the priests withdrew from the Holy Place, the cloud filled the temple of the Lord.
11008011 And the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord filled his temple.
11008012 Then Solomon said, “The Lord has said that he would dwell in a dark cloud;
11008013 I have indeed built a magnificent temple for you, a place for you to dwell forever.”
11008014 While the whole assembly of Israel was standing there, the king turned around and blessed them.
11008015 Then he said: “Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who with his own hand has fulfilled what he promised with his own mouth to my father David. For he said,
11008016 ‘Since the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built so that my Name might be there, but I have chosen David to rule my people Israel.’
11008017 “My father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of the Lord, the God of Israel.
11008018 But the Lord said to my father David, ‘You did well to have it in your heart to build a temple for my Name.
11008019 Nevertheless, you are not the one to build the temple, but your son, your own flesh and blood—he is the one who will build the temple for my Name.’
11008020 “The Lord has kept the promise he made: I have succeeded David my father and now I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the Lord promised, and I have built the temple for the Name of the Lord, the God of Israel.
11008021 I have provided a place there for the ark, in which is the covenant of the Lord that he made with our ancestors when he brought them out of Egypt.”
11008022 Then Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in front of the whole assembly of Israel, spread out his hands toward heaven
11008023 and said: “Lord, the God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven above or on earth below—you who keep your covenant of love with your servants who continue wholeheartedly in your way.
11008024 You have kept your promise to your servant David my father; with your mouth you have promised and with your hand you have fulfilled it—as it is today.
11008025 “Now Lord, the God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father the promises you made to him when you said, ‘You shall never fail to have a successor to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your descendants are careful in all they do to walk before me faithfully as you have done.’
11008026 And now, God of Israel, let your word that you promised your servant David my father come true.
11008027 “But will God really dwell on earth? The heavens, even the highest heaven, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built!
11008028 Yet give attention to your servant’s prayer and his plea for mercy, Lord my God. Hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is praying in your presence this day.
11008029 May your eyes be open toward this temple night and day, this place of which you said, ‘My Name shall be there,’ so that you will hear the prayer your servant prays toward this place.
11008030 Hear the supplication of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven, your dwelling place, and when you hear, forgive.
11008031 “When anyone wrongs their neighbor and is required to take an oath and they come and swear the oath before your altar in this temple,
11008032 then hear from heaven and act. Judge between your servants, condemning the guilty by bringing down on their heads what they have done, and vindicating the innocent by treating them in accordance with their innocence.
11008033 “When your people Israel have been defeated by an enemy because they have sinned against you, and when they turn back to you and give praise to your name, praying and making supplication to you in this temple,
11008034 then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them back to the land you gave to their ancestors.
11008035 “When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you, and when they pray toward this place and give praise to your name and turn from their sin because you have afflicted them,
11008036 then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them the right way to live, and send rain on the land you gave your people for an inheritance.
11008037 “When famine or plague comes to the land, or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers, or when an enemy besieges them in any of their cities, whatever disaster or disease may come,
11008038 and when a prayer or plea is made by anyone among your people Israel—being aware of the afflictions of their own hearts, and spreading out their hands toward this temple—
11008039 then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Forgive and act; deal with everyone according to all they do, since you know their hearts (for you alone know every human heart),
11008040 so that they will fear you all the time they live in the land you gave our ancestors.
11008041 “As for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of your name—
11008042 for they will hear of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm—when they come and pray toward this temple,
11008043 then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel, and may know that this house I have built bears your Name.
11008044 “When your people go to war against their enemies, wherever you send them, and when they pray to the Lord toward the city you have chosen and the temple I have built for your Name,
11008045 then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause.
11008046 “When they sin against you—for there is no one who does not sin—and you become angry with them and give them over to their enemies, who take them captive to their own lands, far away or near;
11008047 and if they have a change of heart in the land where they are held captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their captors and say, ‘We have sinned, we have done wrong, we have acted wickedly’;
11008048 and if they turn back to you with all their heart and soul in the land of their enemies who took them captive, and pray to you toward the land you gave their ancestors, toward the city you have chosen and the temple I have built for your Name;
11008049 then from heaven, your dwelling place, hear their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause.
11008050 And forgive your people, who have sinned against you; forgive all the offenses they have committed against you, and cause their captors to show them mercy;
11008051 for they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out of Egypt, out of that iron-smelting furnace.
11008052 “May your eyes be open to your servant’s plea and to the plea of your people Israel, and may you listen to them whenever they cry out to you.
11008053 For you singled them out from all the nations of the world to be your own inheritance, just as you declared through your servant Moses when you, Sovereign Lord, brought our ancestors out of Egypt.”
11008054 When Solomon had finished all these prayers and supplications to the Lord, he rose from before the altar of the Lord, where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out toward heaven.
11008055 He stood and blessed the whole assembly of Israel in a loud voice, saying:
11008056 “Praise be to the Lord, who has given rest to his people Israel just as he promised. Not one word has failed of all the good promises he gave through his servant Moses.
11008057 May the Lord our God be with us as he was with our ancestors; may he never leave us nor forsake us.
11008058 May he turn our hearts to him, to walk in obedience to him and keep the commands, decrees and laws he gave our ancestors.
11008059 And may these words of mine, which I have prayed before the Lord, be near to the Lord our God day and night, that he may uphold the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel according to each day’s need,
11008060 so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the Lord is God and that there is no other.
11008061 And may your hearts be fully committed to the Lord our God, to live by his decrees and obey his commands, as at this time.”
11008062 Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the Lord.
11008063 Solomon offered a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the Lord: twenty-two thousand cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the temple of the Lord.
11008064 On that same day the king consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the Lord, and there he offered burnt offerings, grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings, because the bronze altar that stood before the Lord was too small to hold the burnt offerings, the grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings.
11008065 So Solomon observed the festival at that time, and all Israel with him—a vast assembly, people from Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt. They celebrated it before the Lord our God for seven days and seven days more, fourteen days in all.
11008066 On the following day he sent the people away. They blessed the king and then went home, joyful and glad in heart for all the good things the Lord had done for his servant David and his people Israel.
11009001 When Solomon had finished building the temple of the Lord and the royal palace, and had achieved all he had desired to do,
11009002 the Lord appeared to him a second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.
11009003 The Lord said to him: “I have heard the prayer and plea you have made before me; I have consecrated this temple, which you have built, by putting my Name there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.
11009004 “As for you, if you walk before me faithfully with integrity of heart and uprightness, as David your father did, and do all I command and observe my decrees and laws,
11009005 I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father when I said, ‘You shall never fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel.’
11009006 “But if you or your descendants turn away from me and do not observe the commands and decrees I have given you and go off to serve other gods and worship them,
11009007 then I will cut off Israel from the land I have given them and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. Israel will then become a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples.
11009008 This temple will become a heap of rubble. All who pass by will be appalled and will scoff and say, ‘Why has the Lord done such a thing to this land and to this temple?’
11009009 People will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken the Lord their God, who brought their ancestors out of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them—that is why the Lord brought all this disaster on them.’ ”
11009010 At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon built these two buildings—the temple of the Lord and the royal palace—
11009011 King Solomon gave twenty towns in Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre, because Hiram had supplied him with all the cedar and juniper and gold he wanted.
11009012 But when Hiram went from Tyre to see the towns that Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them.
11009013 “What kind of towns are these you have given me, my brother?” he asked. And he called them the Land of Kabul, a name they have to this day.
11009014 Now Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents of gold.
11009015 Here is the account of the forced labor King Solomon conscripted to build the Lord’s temple, his own palace, the terraces, the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, Megiddo and Gezer.
11009016 (Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. He had set it on fire. He killed its Canaanite inhabitants and then gave it as a wedding gift to his daughter, Solomon’s wife.
11009017 And Solomon rebuilt Gezer.) He built up Lower Beth Horon,
11009018 Baalath, and Tadmor in the desert, within his land,
11009019 as well as all his store cities and the towns for his chariots and for his horses —whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon and throughout all the territory he ruled.
11009020 There were still people left from the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites (these peoples were not Israelites).
11009021 Solomon conscripted the descendants of all these peoples remaining in the land—whom the Israelites could not exterminate —to serve as slave labor, as it is to this day.
11009022 But Solomon did not make slaves of any of the Israelites; they were his fighting men, his government officials, his officers, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and charioteers.
11009023 They were also the chief officials in charge of Solomon’s projects—550 officials supervising those who did the work.
11009024 After Pharaoh’s daughter had come up from the City of David to the palace Solomon had built for her, he constructed the terraces.
11009025 Three times a year Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar he had built for the Lord, burning incense before the Lord along with them, and so fulfilled the temple obligations.
11009026 King Solomon also built ships at Ezion Geber, which is near Elath in Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea.
11009027 And Hiram sent his men—sailors who knew the sea—to serve in the fleet with Solomon’s men.
11009028 They sailed to Ophir and brought back 420 talents of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.
11010001 When the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon and his relationship to the Lord, she came to test Solomon with hard questions.
11010002 Arriving at Jerusalem with a very great caravan—with camels carrying spices, large quantities of gold, and precious stones—she came to Solomon and talked with him about all that she had on her mind.
11010003 Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too hard for the king to explain to her.
11010004 When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon and the palace he had built,
11010005 the food on his table, the seating of his officials, the attending servants in their robes, his cupbearers, and the burnt offerings he made at the temple of the Lord, she was overwhelmed.
11010006 She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true.
11010007 But I did not believe these things until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half was told me; in wisdom and wealth you have far exceeded the report I heard.
11010008 How happy your people must be! How happy your officials, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!
11010009 Praise be to the Lord your God, who has delighted in you and placed you on the throne of Israel. Because of the Lord’s eternal love for Israel, he has made you king to maintain justice and righteousness.”
11010010 And she gave the king 120 talents of gold, large quantities of spices, and precious stones. Never again were so many spices brought in as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
11010011 (Hiram’s ships brought gold from Ophir; and from there they brought great cargoes of almugwood and precious stones.
11010012 The king used the almugwood to make supports for the temple of the Lord and for the royal palace, and to make harps and lyres for the musicians. So much almugwood has never been imported or seen since that day.)
11010013 King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for, besides what he had given her out of his royal bounty. Then she left and returned with her retinue to her own country.
11010014 The weight of the gold that Solomon received yearly was 666 talents,
11010015 not including the revenues from merchants and traders and from all the Arabian kings and the governors of the territories.
11010016 King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of gold went into each shield.
11010017 He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold, with three minas of gold in each shield. The king put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon.
11010018 Then the king made a great throne covered with ivory and overlaid with fine gold.
11010019 The throne had six steps, and its back had a rounded top. On both sides of the seat were armrests, with a lion standing beside each of them.
11010020 Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like it had ever been made for any other kingdom.
11010021 All King Solomon’s goblets were gold, and all the household articles in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Nothing was made of silver, because silver was considered of little value in Solomon’s days.
11010022 The king had a fleet of trading ships at sea along with the ships of Hiram. Once every three years it returned, carrying gold, silver and ivory, and apes and baboons.
11010023 King Solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth.
11010024 The whole world sought audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had put in his heart.
11010025 Year after year, everyone who came brought a gift—articles of silver and gold, robes, weapons and spices, and horses and mules.
11010026 Solomon accumulated chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses, which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.
11010027 The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills.
11010028 Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue —the royal merchants purchased them from Kue at the current price.
11010029 They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. They also exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and of the Arameans.
11011001 King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh’s daughter—Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites.
11011002 They were from nations about which the Lord had told the Israelites, “You must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods.” Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love.
11011003 He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray.
11011004 As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the Lord his God, as the heart of David his father had been.
11011005 He followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molek the detestable god of the Ammonites.
11011006 So Solomon did evil in the eyes of the Lord; he did not follow the Lord completely, as David his father had done.
11011007 On a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable god of Moab, and for Molek the detestable god of the Ammonites.
11011008 He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods.
11011009 The Lord became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice.
11011010 Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the Lord’s command.
11011011 So the Lord said to Solomon, “Since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees, which I commanded you, I will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates.
11011012 Nevertheless, for the sake of David your father, I will not do it during your lifetime. I will tear it out of the hand of your son.
11011013 Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom from him, but will give him one tribe for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.”
11011014 Then the Lord raised up against Solomon an adversary, Hadad the Edomite, from the royal line of Edom.
11011015 Earlier when David was fighting with Edom, Joab the commander of the army, who had gone up to bury the dead, had struck down all the men in Edom.
11011016 Joab and all the Israelites stayed there for six months, until they had destroyed all the men in Edom.
11011017 But Hadad, still only a boy, fled to Egypt with some Edomite officials who had served his father.
11011018 They set out from Midian and went to Paran. Then taking people from Paran with them, they went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house and land and provided him with food.
11011019 Pharaoh was so pleased with Hadad that he gave him a sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes, in marriage.
11011020 The sister of Tahpenes bore him a son named Genubath, whom Tahpenes brought up in the royal palace. There Genubath lived with Pharaoh’s own children.
11011021 While he was in Egypt, Hadad heard that David rested with his ancestors and that Joab the commander of the army was also dead. Then Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let me go, that I may return to my own country.”
11011022 “What have you lacked here that you want to go back to your own country?” Pharaoh asked. “Nothing,” Hadad replied, “but do let me go!”
11011023 And God raised up against Solomon another adversary, Rezon son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah.
11011024 When David destroyed Zobah’s army, Rezon gathered a band of men around him and became their leader; they went to Damascus, where they settled and took control.
11011025 Rezon was Israel’s adversary as long as Solomon lived, adding to the trouble caused by Hadad. So Rezon ruled in Aram and was hostile toward Israel.
11011026 Also, Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against the king. He was one of Solomon’s officials, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, and his mother was a widow named Zeruah.
11011027 Here is the account of how he rebelled against the king: Solomon had built the terraces and had filled in the gap in the wall of the city of David his father.
11011028 Now Jeroboam was a man of standing, and when Solomon saw how well the young man did his work, he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the tribes of Joseph.
11011029 About that time Jeroboam was going out of Jerusalem, and Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh met him on the way, wearing a new cloak. The two of them were alone out in the country,
11011030 and Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces.
11011031 Then he said to Jeroboam, “Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘See, I am going to tear the kingdom out of Solomon’s hand and give you ten tribes.
11011032 But for the sake of my servant David and the city of Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, he will have one tribe.
11011033 I will do this because they have forsaken me and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Molek the god of the Ammonites, and have not walked in obedience to me, nor done what is right in my eyes, nor kept my decrees and laws as David, Solomon’s father, did.
11011034 “ ‘But I will not take the whole kingdom out of Solomon’s hand; I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David my servant, whom I chose and who obeyed my commands and decrees.
11011035 I will take the kingdom from his son’s hands and give you ten tribes.
11011036 I will give one tribe to his son so that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I chose to put my Name.
11011037 However, as for you, I will take you, and you will rule over all that your heart desires; you will be king over Israel.
11011038 If you do whatever I command you and walk in obedience to me and do what is right in my eyes by obeying my decrees and commands, as David my servant did, I will be with you. I will build you a dynasty as enduring as the one I built for David and will give Israel to you.
11011039 I will humble David’s descendants because of this, but not forever.’ ”
11011040 Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam fled to Egypt, to Shishak the king, and stayed there until Solomon’s death.
11011041 As for the other events of Solomon’s reign—all he did and the wisdom he displayed—are they not written in the book of the annals of Solomon?
11011042 Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
11011043 Then he rested with his ancestors and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son succeeded him as king.
11012001 Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone there to make him king.
11012002 When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this (he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), he returned from Egypt.
11012003 So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and the whole assembly of Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him:
11012004 “Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.”
11012005 Rehoboam answered, “Go away for three days and then come back to me.” So the people went away.
11012006 Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. “How would you advise me to answer these people?” he asked.
11012007 They replied, “If today you will be a servant to these people and serve them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants.”
11012008 But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him.
11012009 He asked them, “What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?”
11012010 The young men who had grown up with him replied, “These people have said to you, ‘Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter.’ Now tell them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist.
11012011 My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.’ ”
11012012 Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, “Come back to me in three days.”
11012013 The king answered the people harshly. Rejecting the advice given him by the elders,
11012014 he followed the advice of the young men and said, “My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.”
11012015 So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from the Lord, to fulfill the word the Lord had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite.
11012016 When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king: “What share do we have in David, what part in Jesse’s son? To your tents, Israel! Look after your own house, David!” So the Israelites went home.
11012017 But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam still ruled over them.
11012018 King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram, who was in charge of forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam, however, managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.
11012019 So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
11012020 When all the Israelites heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David.
11012021 When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mustered all Judah and the tribe of Benjamin—a hundred and eighty thousand able young men—to go to war against Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam son of Solomon.
11012022 But this word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God:
11012023 “Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, to all Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people,
11012024 ‘This is what the Lord says: Do not go up to fight against your brothers, the Israelites. Go home, every one of you, for this is my doing.’ ” So they obeyed the word of the Lord and went home again, as the Lord had ordered.
11012025 Then Jeroboam fortified Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. From there he went out and built up Peniel.
11012026 Jeroboam thought to himself, “The kingdom will now likely revert to the house of David.
11012027 If these people go up to offer sacrifices at the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem, they will again give their allegiance to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah. They will kill me and return to King Rehoboam.”
11012028 After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves. He said to the people, “It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.”
11012029 One he set up in Bethel, and the other in Dan.
11012030 And this thing became a sin; the people came to worship the one at Bethel and went as far as Dan to worship the other.
11012031 Jeroboam built shrines on high places and appointed priests from all sorts of people, even though they were not Levites.
11012032 He instituted a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the festival held in Judah, and offered sacrifices on the altar. This he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves he had made. And at Bethel he also installed priests at the high places he had made.
11012033 On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a month of his own choosing, he offered sacrifices on the altar he had built at Bethel. So he instituted the festival for the Israelites and went up to the altar to make offerings.
11013001 By the word of the Lord a man of God came from Judah to Bethel, as Jeroboam was standing by the altar to make an offering.
11013002 By the word of the Lord he cried out against the altar: “Altar, altar! This is what the Lord says: ‘A son named Josiah will be born to the house of David. On you he will sacrifice the priests of the high places who make offerings here, and human bones will be burned on you.’ ”
11013003 That same day the man of God gave a sign: “This is the sign the Lord has declared: The altar will be split apart and the ashes on it will be poured out.”
11013004 When King Jeroboam heard what the man of God cried out against the altar at Bethel, he stretched out his hand from the altar and said, “Seize him!” But the hand he stretched out toward the man shriveled up, so that he could not pull it back.
11013005 Also, the altar was split apart and its ashes poured out according to the sign given by the man of God by the word of the Lord.
11013006 Then the king said to the man of God, “Intercede with the Lord your God and pray for me that my hand may be restored.” So the man of God interceded with the Lord, and the king’s hand was restored and became as it was before.
11013007 The king said to the man of God, “Come home with me for a meal, and I will give you a gift.”
11013008 But the man of God answered the king, “Even if you were to give me half your possessions, I would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water here.
11013009 For I was commanded by the word of the Lord: ‘You must not eat bread or drink water or return by the way you came.’ ”
11013010 So he took another road and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel.
11013011 Now there was a certain old prophet living in Bethel, whose sons came and told him all that the man of God had done there that day. They also told their father what he had said to the king.
11013012 Their father asked them, “Which way did he go?” And his sons showed him which road the man of God from Judah had taken.
11013013 So he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” And when they had saddled the donkey for him, he mounted it
11013014 and rode after the man of God. He found him sitting under an oak tree and asked, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” “I am,” he replied.
11013015 So the prophet said to him, “Come home with me and eat.”
11013016 The man of God said, “I cannot turn back and go with you, nor can I eat bread or drink water with you in this place.
11013017 I have been told by the word of the Lord: ‘You must not eat bread or drink water there or return by the way you came.’ ”
11013018 The old prophet answered, “I too am a prophet, as you are. And an angel said to me by the word of the Lord: ‘Bring him back with you to your house so that he may eat bread and drink water.’ ” (But he was lying to him.)
11013019 So the man of God returned with him and ate and drank in his house.
11013020 While they were sitting at the table, the word of the Lord came to the old prophet who had brought him back.
11013021 He cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, “This is what the Lord says: ‘You have defied the word of the Lord and have not kept the command the Lord your God gave you.
11013022 You came back and ate bread and drank water in the place where he told you not to eat or drink. Therefore your body will not be buried in the tomb of your ancestors.’ ”
11013023 When the man of God had finished eating and drinking, the prophet who had brought him back saddled his donkey for him.
11013024 As he went on his way, a lion met him on the road and killed him, and his body was left lying on the road, with both the donkey and the lion standing beside it.
11013025 Some people who passed by saw the body lying there, with the lion standing beside the body, and they went and reported it in the city where the old prophet lived.
11013026 When the prophet who had brought him back from his journey heard of it, he said, “It is the man of God who defied the word of the Lord. The Lord has given him over to the lion, which has mauled him and killed him, as the word of the Lord had warned him.”
11013027 The prophet said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me,” and they did so.
11013028 Then he went out and found the body lying on the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion had neither eaten the body nor mauled the donkey.
11013029 So the prophet picked up the body of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back to his own city to mourn for him and bury him.
11013030 Then he laid the body in his own tomb, and they mourned over him and said, “Alas, my brother!”
11013031 After burying him, he said to his sons, “When I die, bury me in the grave where the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
11013032 For the message he declared by the word of the Lord against the altar in Bethel and against all the shrines on the high places in the towns of Samaria will certainly come true.”
11013033 Even after this, Jeroboam did not change his evil ways, but once more appointed priests for the high places from all sorts of people. Anyone who wanted to become a priest he consecrated for the high places.
11013034 This was the sin of the house of Jeroboam that led to its downfall and to its destruction from the face of the earth.
11014001 At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill,
11014002 and Jeroboam said to his wife, “Go, disguise yourself, so you won’t be recognized as the wife of Jeroboam. Then go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is there—the one who told me I would be king over this people.
11014003 Take ten loaves of bread with you, some cakes and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy.”
11014004 So Jeroboam’s wife did what he said and went to Ahijah’s house in Shiloh. Now Ahijah could not see; his sight was gone because of his age.
11014005 But the Lord had told Ahijah, “Jeroboam’s wife is coming to ask you about her son, for he is ill, and you are to give her such and such an answer. When she arrives, she will pretend to be someone else.”
11014006 So when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps at the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why this pretense? I have been sent to you with bad news.
11014007 Go, tell Jeroboam that this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘I raised you up from among the people and appointed you ruler over my people Israel.
11014008 I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you, but you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commands and followed me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes.
11014009 You have done more evil than all who lived before you. You have made for yourself other gods, idols made of metal; you have aroused my anger and turned your back on me.
11014010 “ ‘Because of this, I am going to bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam. I will cut off from Jeroboam every last male in Israel—slave or free. I will burn up the house of Jeroboam as one burns dung, until it is all gone.
11014011 Dogs will eat those belonging to Jeroboam who die in the city, and the birds will feed on those who die in the country. The Lord has spoken!’
11014012 “As for you, go back home. When you set foot in your city, the boy will die.
11014013 All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He is the only one belonging to Jeroboam who will be buried, because he is the only one in the house of Jeroboam in whom the Lord, the God of Israel, has found anything good.
11014014 “The Lord will raise up for himself a king over Israel who will cut off the family of Jeroboam. Even now this is beginning to happen.
11014015 And the Lord will strike Israel, so that it will be like a reed swaying in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that he gave to their ancestors and scatter them beyond the Euphrates River, because they aroused the Lord’s anger by making Asherah poles.
11014016 And he will give Israel up because of the sins Jeroboam has committed and has caused Israel to commit.”
11014017 Then Jeroboam’s wife got up and left and went to Tirzah. As soon as she stepped over the threshold of the house, the boy died.
11014018 They buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, as the Lord had said through his servant the prophet Ahijah.
11014019 The other events of Jeroboam’s reign, his wars and how he ruled, are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.
11014020 He reigned for twenty-two years and then rested with his ancestors. And Nadab his son succeeded him as king.
11014021 Rehoboam son of Solomon was king in Judah. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel in which to put his Name. His mother’s name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite.
11014022 Judah did evil in the eyes of the Lord. By the sins they committed they stirred up his jealous anger more than those who were before them had done.
11014023 They also set up for themselves high places, sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree.
11014024 There were even male shrine prostitutes in the land; the people engaged in all the detestable practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites.
11014025 In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem.
11014026 He carried off the treasures of the temple of the Lord and the treasures of the royal palace. He took everything, including all the gold shields Solomon had made.
11014027 So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.
11014028 Whenever the king went to the Lord’s temple, the guards bore the shields, and afterward they returned them to the guardroom.
11014029 As for the other events of Rehoboam’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
11014030 There was continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.
11014031 And Rehoboam rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. His mother’s name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite. And Abijah his son succeeded him as king.
11015001 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam son of Nebat, Abijah became king of Judah,
11015002 and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother’s name was Maakah daughter of Abishalom.
11015003 He committed all the sins his father had done before him; his heart was not fully devoted to the Lord his God, as the heart of David his forefather had been.
11015004 Nevertheless, for David’s sake the Lord his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem by raising up a son to succeed him and by making Jerusalem strong.
11015005 For David had done what was right in the eyes of the Lord and had not failed to keep any of the Lord’s commands all the days of his life—except in the case of Uriah the Hittite.
11015006 There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam throughout Abijah’s lifetime.
11015007 As for the other events of Abijah’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
11015008 And Abijah rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. And Asa his son succeeded him as king.
11015009 In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa became king of Judah,
11015010 and he reigned in Jerusalem forty-one years. His grandmother’s name was Maakah daughter of Abishalom.
11015011 Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done.
11015012 He expelled the male shrine prostitutes from the land and got rid of all the idols his ancestors had made.
11015013 He even deposed his grandmother Maakah from her position as queen mother, because she had made a repulsive image for the worship of Asherah. Asa cut it down and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
11015014 Although he did not remove the high places, Asa’s heart was fully committed to the Lord all his life.
11015015 He brought into the temple of the Lord the silver and gold and the articles that he and his father had dedicated.
11015016 There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their reigns.
11015017 Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah.
11015018 Asa then took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the Lord’s temple and of his own palace. He entrusted it to his officials and sent them to Ben-Hadad son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, the king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus.
11015019 “Let there be a treaty between me and you,” he said, “as there was between my father and your father. See, I am sending you a gift of silver and gold. Now break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will withdraw from me.”
11015020 Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of Israel. He conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maakah and all Kinnereth in addition to Naphtali.
11015021 When Baasha heard this, he stopped building Ramah and withdrew to Tirzah.
11015022 Then King Asa issued an order to all Judah—no one was exempt—and they carried away from Ramah the stones and timber Baasha had been using there. With them King Asa built up Geba in Benjamin, and also Mizpah.
11015023 As for all the other events of Asa’s reign, all his achievements, all he did and the cities he built, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? In his old age, however, his feet became diseased.
11015024 Then Asa rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of his father David. And Jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king.
11015025 Nadab son of Jeroboam became king of Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years.
11015026 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, following the ways of his father and committing the same sin his father had caused Israel to commit.
11015027 Baasha son of Ahijah from the tribe of Issachar plotted against him, and he struck him down at Gibbethon, a Philistine town, while Nadab and all Israel were besieging it.
11015028 Baasha killed Nadab in the third year of Asa king of Judah and succeeded him as king.
11015029 As soon as he began to reign, he killed Jeroboam’s whole family. He did not leave Jeroboam anyone that breathed, but destroyed them all, according to the word of the Lord given through his servant Ahijah the Shilonite.
11015030 This happened because of the sins Jeroboam had committed and had caused Israel to commit, and because he aroused the anger of the Lord, the God of Israel.
11015031 As for the other events of Nadab’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
11015032 There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their reigns.
11015033 In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah became king of all Israel in Tirzah, and he reigned twenty-four years.
11015034 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, following the ways of Jeroboam and committing the same sin Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit.
11016001 Then the word of the Lord came to Jehu son of Hanani concerning Baasha:
11016002 “I lifted you up from the dust and appointed you ruler over my people Israel, but you followed the ways of Jeroboam and caused my people Israel to sin and to arouse my anger by their sins.
11016003 So I am about to wipe out Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat.
11016004 Dogs will eat those belonging to Baasha who die in the city, and birds will feed on those who die in the country.”
11016005 As for the other events of Baasha’s reign, what he did and his achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
11016006 Baasha rested with his ancestors and was buried in Tirzah. And Elah his son succeeded him as king.
11016007 Moreover, the word of the Lord came through the prophet Jehu son of Hanani to Baasha and his house, because of all the evil he had done in the eyes of the Lord, arousing his anger by the things he did, becoming like the house of Jeroboam—and also because he destroyed it.
11016008 In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel, and he reigned in Tirzah two years.
11016009 Zimri, one of his officials, who had command of half his chariots, plotted against him. Elah was in Tirzah at the time, getting drunk in the home of Arza, the palace administrator at Tirzah.
11016010 Zimri came in, struck him down and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah. Then he succeeded him as king.
11016011 As soon as he began to reign and was seated on the throne, he killed off Baasha’s whole family. He did not spare a single male, whether relative or friend.
11016012 So Zimri destroyed the whole family of Baasha, in accordance with the word of the Lord spoken against Baasha through the prophet Jehu—
11016013 because of all the sins Baasha and his son Elah had committed and had caused Israel to commit, so that they aroused the anger of the Lord, the God of Israel, by their worthless idols.
11016014 As for the other events of Elah’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
11016015 In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned in Tirzah seven days. The army was encamped near Gibbethon, a Philistine town.
11016016 When the Israelites in the camp heard that Zimri had plotted against the king and murdered him, they proclaimed Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that very day there in the camp.
11016017 Then Omri and all the Israelites with him withdrew from Gibbethon and laid siege to Tirzah.
11016018 When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the royal palace and set the palace on fire around him. So he died,
11016019 because of the sins he had committed, doing evil in the eyes of the Lord and following the ways of Jeroboam and committing the same sin Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit.
11016020 As for the other events of Zimri’s reign, and the rebellion he carried out, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
11016021 Then the people of Israel were split into two factions; half supported Tibni son of Ginath for king, and the other half supported Omri.
11016022 But Omri’s followers proved stronger than those of Tibni son of Ginath. So Tibni died and Omri became king.
11016023 In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned twelve years, six of them in Tirzah.
11016024 He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver and built a city on the hill, calling it Samaria, after Shemer, the name of the former owner of the hill.
11016025 But Omri did evil in the eyes of the Lord and sinned more than all those before him.
11016026 He followed completely the ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat, committing the same sin Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit, so that they aroused the anger of the Lord, the God of Israel, by their worthless idols.
11016027 As for the other events of Omri’s reign, what he did and the things he achieved, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
11016028 Omri rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria. And Ahab his son succeeded him as king.
11016029 In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab son of Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria over Israel twenty-two years.
11016030 Ahab son of Omri did more evil in the eyes of the Lord than any of those before him.
11016031 He not only considered it trivial to commit the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, but he also married Jezebel daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and began to serve Baal and worship him.
11016032 He set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal that he built in Samaria.
11016033 Ahab also made an Asherah pole and did more to arouse the anger of the Lord, the God of Israel, than did all the kings of Israel before him.
11016034 In Ahab’s time, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundations at the cost of his firstborn son Abiram, and he set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, in accordance with the word of the Lord spoken by Joshua son of Nun.
11017001 Now Elijah the Tishbite, from Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, “As the Lord, the God of Israel, lives, whom I serve, there will be neither dew nor rain in the next few years except at my word.”
11017002 Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah:
11017003 “Leave here, turn eastward and hide in the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan.
11017004 You will drink from the brook, and I have directed the ravens to supply you with food there.”
11017005 So he did what the Lord had told him. He went to the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan, and stayed there.
11017006 The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook.
11017007 Some time later the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land.
11017008 Then the word of the Lord came to him:
11017009 “Go at once to Zarephath in the region of Sidon and stay there. I have directed a widow there to supply you with food.”
11017010 So he went to Zarephath. When he came to the town gate, a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to her and asked, “Would you bring me a little water in a jar so I may have a drink?”
11017011 As she was going to get it, he called, “And bring me, please, a piece of bread.”
11017012 “As surely as the Lord your God lives,” she replied, “I don’t have any bread—only a handful of flour in a jar and a little olive oil in a jug. I am gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son, that we may eat it—and die.”
11017013 Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go home and do as you have said. But first make a small loaf of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me, and then make something for yourself and your son.
11017014 For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the Lord sends rain on the land.’ ”
11017015 She went away and did as Elijah had told her. So there was food every day for Elijah and for the woman and her family.
11017016 For the jar of flour was not used up and the jug of oil did not run dry, in keeping with the word of the Lord spoken by Elijah.
11017017 Some time later the son of the woman who owned the house became ill. He grew worse and worse, and finally stopped breathing.
11017018 She said to Elijah, “What do you have against me, man of God? Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?”
11017019 “Give me your son,” Elijah replied. He took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his bed.
11017020 Then he cried out to the Lord, “Lord my God, have you brought tragedy even on this widow I am staying with, by causing her son to die?”
11017021 Then he stretched himself out on the boy three times and cried out to the Lord, “Lord my God, let this boy’s life return to him!”
11017022 The Lord heard Elijah’s cry, and the boy’s life returned to him, and he lived.
11017023 Elijah picked up the child and carried him down from the room into the house. He gave him to his mother and said, “Look, your son is alive!”
11017024 Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the Lord from your mouth is the truth.”
11018001 After a long time, in the third year, the word of the Lord came to Elijah: “Go and present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the land.”
11018002 So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria,
11018003 and Ahab had summoned Obadiah, his palace administrator. (Obadiah was a devout believer in the Lord.
11018004 While Jezebel was killing off the Lord’s prophets, Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them in two caves, fifty in each, and had supplied them with food and water.)
11018005 Ahab had said to Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs and valleys. Maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive so we will not have to kill any of our animals.”
11018006 So they divided the land they were to cover, Ahab going in one direction and Obadiah in another.
11018007 As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down to the ground, and said, “Is it really you, my lord Elijah?”
11018008 “Yes,” he replied. “Go tell your master, ‘Elijah is here.’ ”
11018009 “What have I done wrong,” asked Obadiah, “that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be put to death?
11018010 As surely as the Lord your God lives, there is not a nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to look for you. And whenever a nation or kingdom claimed you were not there, he made them swear they could not find you.
11018011 But now you tell me to go to my master and say, ‘Elijah is here.’
11018012 I don’t know where the Spirit of the Lord may carry you when I leave you. If I go and tell Ahab and he doesn’t find you, he will kill me. Yet I your servant have worshiped the Lord since my youth.
11018013 Haven’t you heard, my lord, what I did while Jezebel was killing the prophets of the Lord? I hid a hundred of the Lord’s prophets in two caves, fifty in each, and supplied them with food and water.
11018014 And now you tell me to go to my master and say, ‘Elijah is here.’ He will kill me!”
11018015 Elijah said, “As the Lord Almighty lives, whom I serve, I will surely present myself to Ahab today.”
11018016 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
11018017 When he saw Elijah, he said to him, “Is that you, you troubler of Israel?”
11018018 “I have not made trouble for Israel,” Elijah replied. “But you and your father’s family have. You have abandoned the Lord’s commands and have followed the Baals.
11018019 Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. And bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table.”
11018020 So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel.
11018021 Elijah went before the people and said, “How long will you waver between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him.” But the people said nothing.
11018022 Then Elijah said to them, “I am the only one of the Lord’s prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets.
11018023 Get two bulls for us. Let Baal’s prophets choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it.
11018024 Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the Lord. The god who answers by fire—he is God.” Then all the people said, “What you say is good.”
11018025 Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one of the bulls and prepare it first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire.”
11018026 So they took the bull given them and prepared it. Then they called on the name of Baal from morning till noon. “Baal, answer us!” they shouted. But there was no response; no one answered. And they danced around the altar they had made.
11018027 At noon Elijah began to taunt them. “Shout louder!” he said. “Surely he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling. Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened.”
11018028 So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until their blood flowed.
11018029 Midday passed, and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention.
11018030 Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come here to me.” They came to him, and he repaired the altar of the Lord, which had been torn down.
11018031 Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob, to whom the word of the Lord had come, saying, “Your name shall be Israel.”
11018032 With the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord, and he dug a trench around it large enough to hold two seahs of seed.
11018033 He arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces and laid it on the wood. Then he said to them, “Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood.”
11018034 “Do it again,” he said, and they did it again. “Do it a third time,” he ordered, and they did it the third time.
11018035 The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench.
11018036 At the time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed: “Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command.
11018037 Answer me, Lord, answer me, so these people will know that you, Lord, are God, and that you are turning their hearts back again.”
11018038 Then the fire of the Lord fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench.
11018039 When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, “The Lord—he is God! The Lord—he is God!”
11018040 Then Elijah commanded them, “Seize the prophets of Baal. Don’t let anyone get away!” They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there.
11018041 And Elijah said to Ahab, “Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain.”
11018042 So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees.
11018043 “Go and look toward the sea,” he told his servant. And he went up and looked. “There is nothing there,” he said. Seven times Elijah said, “Go back.”
11018044 The seventh time the servant reported, “A cloud as small as a man’s hand is rising from the sea.” So Elijah said, “Go and tell Ahab, ‘Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.’ ”
11018045 Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain started falling and Ahab rode off to Jezreel.
11018046 The power of the Lord came on Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.
11019001 Now Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.
11019002 So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say, “May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them.”
11019003 Elijah was afraid and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there,
11019004 while he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness. He came to a broom bush, sat down under it and prayed that he might die. “I have had enough, Lord,” he said. “Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors.”
11019005 Then he lay down under the bush and fell asleep. All at once an angel touched him and said, “Get up and eat.”
11019006 He looked around, and there by his head was some bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank and then lay down again.
11019007 The angel of the Lord came back a second time and touched him and said, “Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you.”
11019008 So he got up and ate and drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God.
11019009 There he went into a cave and spent the night. And the word of the Lord came to him: “What are you doing here, Elijah?”
11019010 He replied, “I have been very zealous for the Lord God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, torn down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too.”
11019011 The Lord said, “Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord, for the Lord is about to pass by.” Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake.
11019012 After the earthquake came a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper.
11019013 When Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave. Then a voice said to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”
11019014 He replied, “I have been very zealous for the Lord God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, torn down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too.”
11019015 The Lord said to him, “Go back the way you came, and go to the Desert of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael king over Aram.
11019016 Also, anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet.
11019017 Jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death any who escape the sword of Jehu.
11019018 Yet I reserve seven thousand in Israel—all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal and whose mouths have not kissed him.”
11019019 So Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, and he himself was driving the twelfth pair. Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him.
11019020 Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah. “Let me kiss my father and mother goodbye,” he said, “and then I will come with you.” “Go back,” Elijah replied. “What have I done to you?”
11019021 So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his servant.
11020001 Now Ben-Hadad king of Aram mustered his entire army. Accompanied by thirty-two kings with their horses and chariots, he went up and besieged Samaria and attacked it.
11020002 He sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, saying, “This is what Ben-Hadad says:
11020003 ‘Your silver and gold are mine, and the best of your wives and children are mine.’ ”
11020004 The king of Israel answered, “Just as you say, my lord the king. I and all I have are yours.”
11020005 The messengers came again and said, “This is what Ben-Hadad says: ‘I sent to demand your silver and gold, your wives and your children.
11020006 But about this time tomorrow I am going to send my officials to search your palace and the houses of your officials. They will seize everything you value and carry it away.’ ”
11020007 The king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land and said to them, “See how this man is looking for trouble! When he sent for my wives and my children, my silver and my gold, I did not refuse him.”
11020008 The elders and the people all answered, “Don’t listen to him or agree to his demands.”
11020009 So he replied to Ben-Hadad’s messengers, “Tell my lord the king, ‘Your servant will do all you demanded the first time, but this demand I cannot meet.’ ” They left and took the answer back to Ben-Hadad.
11020010 Then Ben-Hadad sent another message to Ahab: “May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if enough dust remains in Samaria to give each of my men a handful.”
11020011 The king of Israel answered, “Tell him: ‘One who puts on his armor should not boast like one who takes it off.’ ”
11020012 Ben-Hadad heard this message while he and the kings were drinking in their tents, and he ordered his men: “Prepare to attack.” So they prepared to attack the city.
11020013 Meanwhile a prophet came to Ahab king of Israel and announced, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Do you see this vast army? I will give it into your hand today, and then you will know that I am the Lord.’ ”
11020014 “But who will do this?” asked Ahab. The prophet replied, “This is what the Lord says: ‘The junior officers under the provincial commanders will do it.’ ” “And who will start the battle?” he asked. The prophet answered, “You will.”
11020015 So Ahab summoned the 232 junior officers under the provincial commanders. Then he assembled the rest of the Israelites, 7,000 in all.
11020016 They set out at noon while Ben-Hadad and the 32 kings allied with him were in their tents getting drunk.
11020017 The junior officers under the provincial commanders went out first. Now Ben-Hadad had dispatched scouts, who reported, “Men are advancing from Samaria.”
11020018 He said, “If they have come out for peace, take them alive; if they have come out for war, take them alive.”
11020019 The junior officers under the provincial commanders marched out of the city with the army behind them
11020020 and each one struck down his opponent. At that, the Arameans fled, with the Israelites in pursuit. But Ben-Hadad king of Aram escaped on horseback with some of his horsemen.
11020021 The king of Israel advanced and overpowered the horses and chariots and inflicted heavy losses on the Arameans.
11020022 Afterward, the prophet came to the king of Israel and said, “Strengthen your position and see what must be done, because next spring the king of Aram will attack you again.”
11020023 Meanwhile, the officials of the king of Aram advised him, “Their gods are gods of the hills. That is why they were too strong for us. But if we fight them on the plains, surely we will be stronger than they.
11020024 Do this: Remove all the kings from their commands and replace them with other officers.
11020025 You must also raise an army like the one you lost—horse for horse and chariot for chariot—so we can fight Israel on the plains. Then surely we will be stronger than they.” He agreed with them and acted accordingly.
11020026 The next spring Ben-Hadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.
11020027 When the Israelites were also mustered and given provisions, they marched out to meet them. The Israelites camped opposite them like two small flocks of goats, while the Arameans covered the countryside.
11020028 The man of God came up and told the king of Israel, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Because the Arameans think the Lord is a god of the hills and not a god of the valleys, I will deliver this vast army into your hands, and you will know that I am the Lord.’ ”
11020029 For seven days they camped opposite each other, and on the seventh day the battle was joined. The Israelites inflicted a hundred thousand casualties on the Aramean foot soldiers in one day.
11020030 The rest of them escaped to the city of Aphek, where the wall collapsed on twenty-seven thousand of them. And Ben-Hadad fled to the city and hid in an inner room.
11020031 His officials said to him, “Look, we have heard that the kings of Israel are merciful. Let us go to the king of Israel with sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads. Perhaps he will spare your life.”
11020032 Wearing sackcloth around their waists and ropes around their heads, they went to the king of Israel and said, “Your servant Ben-Hadad says: ‘Please let me live.’ ” The king answered, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”
11020033 The men took this as a good sign and were quick to pick up his word. “Yes, your brother Ben-Hadad!” they said. “Go and get him,” the king said. When Ben-Hadad came out, Ahab had him come up into his chariot.
11020034 “I will return the cities my father took from your father,” Ben-Hadad offered. “You may set up your own market areas in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.” Ahab said, “On the basis of a treaty I will set you free.” So he made a treaty with him, and let him go.
11020035 By the word of the Lord one of the company of the prophets said to his companion, “Strike me with your weapon,” but he refused.
11020036 So the prophet said, “Because you have not obeyed the Lord, as soon as you leave me a lion will kill you.” And after the man went away, a lion found him and killed him.
11020037 The prophet found another man and said, “Strike me, please.” So the man struck him and wounded him.
11020038 Then the prophet went and stood by the road waiting for the king. He disguised himself with his headband down over his eyes.
11020039 As the king passed by, the prophet called out to him, “Your servant went into the thick of the battle, and someone came to me with a captive and said, ‘Guard this man. If he is missing, it will be your life for his life, or you must pay a talent of silver.’
11020040 While your servant was busy here and there, the man disappeared.” “That is your sentence,” the king of Israel said. “You have pronounced it yourself.”
11020041 Then the prophet quickly removed the headband from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets.
11020042 He said to the king, “This is what the Lord says: ‘You have set free a man I had determined should die. Therefore it is your life for his life, your people for his people.’ ”
11020043 Sullen and angry, the king of Israel went to his palace in Samaria.
11021001 Some time later there was an incident involving a vineyard belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite. The vineyard was in Jezreel, close to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
11021002 Ahab said to Naboth, “Let me have your vineyard to use for a vegetable garden, since it is close to my palace. In exchange I will give you a better vineyard or, if you prefer, I will pay you whatever it is worth.”
11021003 But Naboth replied, “The Lord forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my ancestors.”
11021004 So Ahab went home, sullen and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my ancestors.” He lay on his bed sulking and refused to eat.
11021005 His wife Jezebel came in and asked him, “Why are you so sullen? Why won’t you eat?”
11021006 He answered her, “Because I said to Naboth the Jezreelite, ‘Sell me your vineyard; or if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard in its place.’ But he said, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’ ”
11021007 Jezebel his wife said, “Is this how you act as king over Israel? Get up and eat! Cheer up. I’ll get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”
11021008 So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, placed his seal on them, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth’s city with him.
11021009 In those letters she wrote: “Proclaim a day of fasting and seat Naboth in a prominent place among the people.
11021010 But seat two scoundrels opposite him and have them bring charges that he has cursed both God and the king. Then take him out and stone him to death.”
11021011 So the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth’s city did as Jezebel directed in the letters she had written to them.
11021012 They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth in a prominent place among the people.
11021013 Then two scoundrels came and sat opposite him and brought charges against Naboth before the people, saying, “Naboth has cursed both God and the king.” So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death.
11021014 Then they sent word to Jezebel: “Naboth has been stoned to death.”
11021015 As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, “Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite that he refused to sell you. He is no longer alive, but dead.”
11021016 When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up and went down to take possession of Naboth’s vineyard.
11021017 Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite:
11021018 “Go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who rules in Samaria. He is now in Naboth’s vineyard, where he has gone to take possession of it.
11021019 Say to him, ‘This is what the Lord says: Have you not murdered a man and seized his property?’ Then say to him, ‘This is what the Lord says: In the place where dogs licked up Naboth’s blood, dogs will lick up your blood—yes, yours!’ ”
11021020 Ahab said to Elijah, “So you have found me, my enemy!” “I have found you,” he answered, “because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of the Lord.
11021021 He says, ‘I am going to bring disaster on you. I will wipe out your descendants and cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel—slave or free.
11021022 I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and that of Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have aroused my anger and have caused Israel to sin.’
11021023 “And also concerning Jezebel the Lord says: ‘Dogs will devour Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.’
11021024 “Dogs will eat those belonging to Ahab who die in the city, and the birds will feed on those who die in the country.”
11021025 (There was never anyone like Ahab, who sold himself to do evil in the eyes of the Lord, urged on by Jezebel his wife.
11021026 He behaved in the vilest manner by going after idols, like the Amorites the Lord drove out before Israel.)
11021027 When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and fasted. He lay in sackcloth and went around meekly.
11021028 Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite:
11021029 “Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself, I will not bring this disaster in his day, but I will bring it on his house in the days of his son.”
11022001 For three years there was no war between Aram and Israel.
11022002 But in the third year Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to see the king of Israel.
11022003 The king of Israel had said to his officials, “Don’t you know that Ramoth Gilead belongs to us and yet we are doing nothing to retake it from the king of Aram?”
11022004 So he asked Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth Gilead?” Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”
11022005 But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “First seek the counsel of the Lord.”
11022006 So the king of Israel brought together the prophets—about four hundred men—and asked them, “Shall I go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?” “Go,” they answered, “for the Lord will give it into the king’s hand.”
11022007 But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no longer a prophet of the Lord here whom we can inquire of?”
11022008 The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, “There is still one prophet through whom we can inquire of the Lord, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.” “The king should not say such a thing,” Jehoshaphat replied.
11022009 So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.”
11022010 Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.
11022011 Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns and he declared, “This is what the Lord says: ‘With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.’ ”
11022012 All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. “Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious,” they said, “for the Lord will give it into the king’s hand.”
11022013 The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, “Look, the other prophets without exception are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably.”
11022014 But Micaiah said, “As surely as the Lord lives, I can tell him only what the Lord tells me.”
11022015 When he arrived, the king asked him, “Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or not?” “Attack and be victorious,” he answered, “for the Lord will give it into the king’s hand.”
11022016 The king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?”
11022017 Then Micaiah answered, “I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the Lord said, ‘These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.’ ”
11022018 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?”
11022019 Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the multitudes of heaven standing around him on his right and on his left.
11022020 And the Lord said, ‘Who will entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?’ “One suggested this, and another that.
11022021 Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the Lord and said, ‘I will entice him.’
11022022 “ ‘By what means?’ the Lord asked. “ ‘I will go out and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,’ he said. “ ‘You will succeed in enticing him,’ said the Lord. ‘Go and do it.’
11022023 “So now the Lord has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours. The Lord has decreed disaster for you.”
11022024 Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. “Which way did the spirit from the Lord go when he went from me to speak to you?” he asked.
11022025 Micaiah replied, “You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room.”
11022026 The king of Israel then ordered, “Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king’s son
11022027 and say, ‘This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.’ ”
11022028 Micaiah declared, “If you ever return safely, the Lord has not spoken through me.” Then he added, “Mark my words, all you people!”
11022029 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.
11022030 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
11022031 Now the king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, “Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.”
11022032 When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, “Surely this is the king of Israel.” So they turned to attack him, but when Jehoshaphat cried out,
11022033 the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel and stopped pursuing him.
11022034 But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The king told his chariot driver, “Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I’ve been wounded.”
11022035 All day long the battle raged, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. The blood from his wound ran onto the floor of the chariot, and that evening he died.
11022036 As the sun was setting, a cry spread through the army: “Every man to his town. Every man to his land!”
11022037 So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried him there.
11022038 They washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria (where the prostitutes bathed), and the dogs licked up his blood, as the word of the Lord had declared.
11022039 As for the other events of Ahab’s reign, including all he did, the palace he built and adorned with ivory, and the cities he fortified, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
11022040 Ahab rested with his ancestors. And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king.
11022041 Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
11022042 Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
11022043 In everything he followed the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them; he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord. The high places, however, were not removed, and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.
11022044 Jehoshaphat was also at peace with the king of Israel.
11022045 As for the other events of Jehoshaphat’s reign, the things he achieved and his military exploits, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
11022046 He rid the land of the rest of the male shrine prostitutes who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa.
11022047 There was then no king in Edom; a provincial governor ruled.
11022048 Now Jehoshaphat built a fleet of trading ships to go to Ophir for gold, but they never set sail—they were wrecked at Ezion Geber.
11022049 At that time Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my men sail with yours,” but Jehoshaphat refused.
11022050 Then Jehoshaphat rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of David his father. And Jehoram his son succeeded him as king.
11022051 Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years.
11022052 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, because he followed the ways of his father and mother and of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin.
11022053 He served and worshiped Baal and aroused the anger of the Lord, the God of Israel, just as his father had done.
12001001 After Ahab’s death, Moab rebelled against Israel.
12001002 Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers, saying to them, “Go and consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this injury.”
12001003 But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Go up and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going off to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?’
12001004 Therefore this is what the Lord says: ‘You will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!’ ” So Elijah went.
12001005 When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, “Why have you come back?”
12001006 “A man came to meet us,” they replied. “And he said to us, ‘Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, “This is what the Lord says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending messengers to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!” ’ ”
12001007 The king asked them, “What kind of man was it who came to meet you and told you this?”
12001008 They replied, “He had a garment of hair and had a leather belt around his waist.” The king said, “That was Elijah the Tishbite.”
12001009 Then he sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men. The captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, “Man of God, the king says, ‘Come down!’ ”
12001010 Elijah answered the captain, “If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!” Then fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men.
12001011 At this the king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men. The captain said to him, “Man of God, this is what the king says, ‘Come down at once!’ ”
12001012 “If I am a man of God,” Elijah replied, “may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!” Then the fire of God fell from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.
12001013 So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. This third captain went up and fell on his knees before Elijah. “Man of God,” he begged, “please have respect for my life and the lives of these fifty men, your servants!
12001014 See, fire has fallen from heaven and consumed the first two captains and all their men. But now have respect for my life!”
12001015 The angel of the Lord said to Elijah, “Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.” So Elijah got up and went down with him to the king.
12001016 He told the king, “This is what the Lord says: Is it because there is no God in Israel for you to consult that you have sent messengers to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Because you have done this, you will never leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!”
12001017 So he died, according to the word of the Lord that Elijah had spoken. Because Ahaziah had no son, Joram succeeded him as king in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah.
12001018 As for all the other events of Ahaziah’s reign, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
12002001 When the Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal.
12002002 Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here; the Lord has sent me to Bethel.” But Elisha said, “As surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel.
12002003 The company of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and asked, “Do you know that the Lord is going to take your master from you today?” “Yes, I know,” Elisha replied, “so be quiet.”
12002004 Then Elijah said to him, “Stay here, Elisha; the Lord has sent me to Jericho.” And he replied, “As surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you.” So they went to Jericho.
12002005 The company of the prophets at Jericho went up to Elisha and asked him, “Do you know that the Lord is going to take your master from you today?” “Yes, I know,” he replied, “so be quiet.”
12002006 Then Elijah said to him, “Stay here; the Lord has sent me to the Jordan.” And he replied, “As surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you.” So the two of them walked on.
12002007 Fifty men from the company of the prophets went and stood at a distance, facing the place where Elijah and Elisha had stopped at the Jordan.
12002008 Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up and struck the water with it. The water divided to the right and to the left, and the two of them crossed over on dry ground.
12002009 When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?” “Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit,” Elisha replied.
12002010 “You have asked a difficult thing,” Elijah said, “yet if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours—otherwise, it will not.”
12002011 As they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind.
12002012 Elisha saw this and cried out, “My father! My father! The chariots and horsemen of Israel!” And Elisha saw him no more. Then he took hold of his garment and tore it in two.
12002013 Elisha then picked up Elijah’s cloak that had fallen from him and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.
12002014 He took the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and struck the water with it. “Where now is the Lord, the God of Elijah?” he asked. When he struck the water, it divided to the right and to the left, and he crossed over.
12002015 The company of the prophets from Jericho, who were watching, said, “The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha.” And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.
12002016 “Look,” they said, “we your servants have fifty able men. Let them go and look for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has picked him up and set him down on some mountain or in some valley.” “No,” Elisha replied, “do not send them.”
12002017 But they persisted until he was too embarrassed to refuse. So he said, “Send them.” And they sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find him.
12002018 When they returned to Elisha, who was staying in Jericho, he said to them, “Didn’t I tell you not to go?”
12002019 The people of the city said to Elisha, “Look, our lord, this town is well situated, as you can see, but the water is bad and the land is unproductive.”
12002020 “Bring me a new bowl,” he said, “and put salt in it.” So they brought it to him.
12002021 Then he went out to the spring and threw the salt into it, saying, “This is what the Lord says: ‘I have healed this water. Never again will it cause death or make the land unproductive.’ ”
12002022 And the water has remained pure to this day, according to the word Elisha had spoken.
12002023 From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some boys came out of the town and jeered at him. “Get out of here, baldy!” they said. “Get out of here, baldy!”
12002024 He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the Lord. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys.
12002025 And he went on to Mount Carmel and from there returned to Samaria.
12003001 Joram son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned twelve years.
12003002 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, but not as his father and mother had done. He got rid of the sacred stone of Baal that his father had made.
12003003 Nevertheless he clung to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn away from them.
12003004 Now Mesha king of Moab raised sheep, and he had to pay the king of Israel a tribute of a hundred thousand lambs and the wool of a hundred thousand rams.
12003005 But after Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
12003006 So at that time King Joram set out from Samaria and mobilized all Israel.
12003007 He also sent this message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?” “I will go with you,” he replied. “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”
12003008 “By what route shall we attack?” he asked. “Through the Desert of Edom,” he answered.
12003009 So the king of Israel set out with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. After a roundabout march of seven days, the army had no more water for themselves or for the animals with them.
12003010 “What!” exclaimed the king of Israel. “Has the Lord called us three kings together only to deliver us into the hands of Moab?”
12003011 But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no prophet of the Lord here, through whom we may inquire of the Lord?” An officer of the king of Israel answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah. ”
12003012 Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the Lord is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
12003013 Elisha said to the king of Israel, “Why do you want to involve me? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother.” “No,” the king of Israel answered, “because it was the Lord who called us three kings together to deliver us into the hands of Moab.”
12003014 Elisha said, “As surely as the Lord Almighty lives, whom I serve, if I did not have respect for the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not pay any attention to you.
12003015 But now bring me a harpist.” While the harpist was playing, the hand of the Lord came on Elisha
12003016 and he said, “This is what the Lord says: I will fill this valley with pools of water.
12003017 For this is what the Lord says: You will see neither wind nor rain, yet this valley will be filled with water, and you, your cattle and your other animals will drink.
12003018 This is an easy thing in the eyes of the Lord; he will also deliver Moab into your hands.
12003019 You will overthrow every fortified city and every major town. You will cut down every good tree, stop up all the springs, and ruin every good field with stones.”
12003020 The next morning, about the time for offering the sacrifice, there it was—water flowing from the direction of Edom! And the land was filled with water.
12003021 Now all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come to fight against them; so every man, young and old, who could bear arms was called up and stationed on the border.
12003022 When they got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water. To the Moabites across the way, the water looked red—like blood.
12003023 “That’s blood!” they said. “Those kings must have fought and slaughtered each other. Now to the plunder, Moab!”
12003024 But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and fought them until they fled. And the Israelites invaded the land and slaughtered the Moabites.
12003025 They destroyed the towns, and each man threw a stone on every good field until it was covered. They stopped up all the springs and cut down every good tree. Only Kir Hareseth was left with its stones in place, but men armed with slings surrounded it and attacked it.
12003026 When the king of Moab saw that the battle had gone against him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they failed.
12003027 Then he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him as a sacrifice on the city wall. The fury against Israel was great; they withdrew and returned to their own land.
12004001 The wife of a man from the company of the prophets cried out to Elisha, “Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that he revered the Lord. But now his creditor is coming to take my two boys as his slaves.”
12004002 Elisha replied to her, “How can I help you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?” “Your servant has nothing there at all,” she said, “except a small jar of olive oil.”
12004003 Elisha said, “Go around and ask all your neighbors for empty jars. Don’t ask for just a few.
12004004 Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour oil into all the jars, and as each is filled, put it to one side.”
12004005 She left him and shut the door behind her and her sons. They brought the jars to her and she kept pouring.
12004006 When all the jars were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another one.” But he replied, “There is not a jar left.” Then the oil stopped flowing.
12004007 She went and told the man of God, and he said, “Go, sell the oil and pay your debts. You and your sons can live on what is left.”
12004008 One day Elisha went to Shunem. And a well-to-do woman was there, who urged him to stay for a meal. So whenever he came by, he stopped there to eat.
12004009 She said to her husband, “I know that this man who often comes our way is a holy man of God.
12004010 Let’s make a small room on the roof and put in it a bed and a table, a chair and a lamp for him. Then he can stay there whenever he comes to us.”
12004011 One day when Elisha came, he went up to his room and lay down there.
12004012 He said to his servant Gehazi, “Call the Shunammite.” So he called her, and she stood before him.
12004013 Elisha said to him, “Tell her, ‘You have gone to all this trouble for us. Now what can be done for you? Can we speak on your behalf to the king or the commander of the army?’ ” She replied, “I have a home among my own people.”
12004014 “What can be done for her?” Elisha asked. Gehazi said, “She has no son, and her husband is old.”
12004015 Then Elisha said, “Call her.” So he called her, and she stood in the doorway.
12004016 “About this time next year,” Elisha said, “you will hold a son in your arms.” “No, my lord!” she objected. “Please, man of God, don’t mislead your servant!”
12004017 But the woman became pregnant, and the next year about that same time she gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had told her.
12004018 The child grew, and one day he went out to his father, who was with the reapers.
12004019 He said to his father, “My head! My head!” His father told a servant, “Carry him to his mother.”
12004020 After the servant had lifted him up and carried him to his mother, the boy sat on her lap until noon, and then he died.
12004021 She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, then shut the door and went out.
12004022 She called her husband and said, “Please send me one of the servants and a donkey so I can go to the man of God quickly and return.”
12004023 “Why go to him today?” he asked. “It’s not the New Moon or the Sabbath.” “That’s all right,” she said.
12004024 She saddled the donkey and said to her servant, “Lead on; don’t slow down for me unless I tell you.”
12004025 So she set out and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When he saw her in the distance, the man of God said to his servant Gehazi, “Look! There’s the Shunammite!
12004026 Run to meet her and ask her, ‘Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your child all right?’ ” “Everything is all right,” she said.
12004027 When she reached the man of God at the mountain, she took hold of his feet. Gehazi came over to push her away, but the man of God said, “Leave her alone! She is in bitter distress, but the Lord has hidden it from me and has not told me why.”
12004028 “Did I ask you for a son, my lord?” she said. “Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t raise my hopes’?”
12004029 Elisha said to Gehazi, “Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand and run. Don’t greet anyone you meet, and if anyone greets you, do not answer. Lay my staff on the boy’s face.”
12004030 But the child’s mother said, “As surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you.” So he got up and followed her.
12004031 Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the boy’s face, but there was no sound or response. So Gehazi went back to meet Elisha and told him, “The boy has not awakened.”
12004032 When Elisha reached the house, there was the boy lying dead on his couch.
12004033 He went in, shut the door on the two of them and prayed to the Lord.
12004034 Then he got on the bed and lay on the boy, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands. As he stretched himself out on him, the boy’s body grew warm.
12004035 Elisha turned away and walked back and forth in the room and then got on the bed and stretched out on him once more. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.
12004036 Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, “Call the Shunammite.” And he did. When she came, he said, “Take your son.”
12004037 She came in, fell at his feet and bowed to the ground. Then she took her son and went out.
12004038 Elisha returned to Gilgal and there was a famine in that region. While the company of the prophets was meeting with him, he said to his servant, “Put on the large pot and cook some stew for these prophets.”
12004039 One of them went out into the fields to gather herbs and found a wild vine and picked as many of its gourds as his garment could hold. When he returned, he cut them up into the pot of stew, though no one knew what they were.
12004040 The stew was poured out for the men, but as they began to eat it, they cried out, “Man of God, there is death in the pot!” And they could not eat it.
12004041 Elisha said, “Get some flour.” He put it into the pot and said, “Serve it to the people to eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot.
12004042 A man came from Baal Shalishah, bringing the man of God twenty loaves of barley bread baked from the first ripe grain, along with some heads of new grain. “Give it to the people to eat,” Elisha said.
12004043 “How can I set this before a hundred men?” his servant asked. But Elisha answered, “Give it to the people to eat. For this is what the Lord says: ‘They will eat and have some left over.’ ”
12004044 Then he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the Lord.
12005001 Now Naaman was commander of the army of the king of Aram. He was a great man in the sight of his master and highly regarded, because through him the Lord had given victory to Aram. He was a valiant soldier, but he had leprosy.
12005002 Now bands of raiders from Aram had gone out and had taken captive a young girl from Israel, and she served Naaman’s wife.
12005003 She said to her mistress, “If only my master would see the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy.”
12005004 Naaman went to his master and told him what the girl from Israel had said.
12005005 “By all means, go,” the king of Aram replied. “I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” So Naaman left, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold and ten sets of clothing.
12005006 The letter that he took to the king of Israel read: “With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman to you so that you may cure him of his leprosy.”
12005007 As soon as the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his robes and said, “Am I God? Can I kill and bring back to life? Why does this fellow send someone to me to be cured of his leprosy? See how he is trying to pick a quarrel with me!”
12005008 When Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his robes, he sent him this message: “Why have you torn your robes? Have the man come to me and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel.”
12005009 So Naaman went with his horses and chariots and stopped at the door of Elisha’s house.
12005010 Elisha sent a messenger to say to him, “Go, wash yourself seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored and you will be cleansed.”
12005011 But Naaman went away angry and said, “I thought that he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God, wave his hand over the spot and cure me of my leprosy.
12005012 Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn’t I wash in them and be cleansed?” So he turned and went off in a rage.
12005013 Naaman’s servants went to him and said, “My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more, then, when he tells you, ‘Wash and be cleansed’!”
12005014 So he went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, as the man of God had told him, and his flesh was restored and became clean like that of a young boy.
12005015 Then Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God. He stood before him and said, “Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel. So please accept a gift from your servant.”
12005016 The prophet answered, “As surely as the Lord lives, whom I serve, I will not accept a thing.” And even though Naaman urged him, he refused.
12005017 “If you will not,” said Naaman, “please let me, your servant, be given as much earth as a pair of mules can carry, for your servant will never again make burnt offerings and sacrifices to any other god but the Lord.
12005018 But may the Lord forgive your servant for this one thing: When my master enters the temple of Rimmon to bow down and he is leaning on my arm and I have to bow there also—when I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the Lord forgive your servant for this.”
12005019 “Go in peace,” Elisha said. After Naaman had traveled some distance,
12005020 Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said to himself, “My master was too easy on Naaman, this Aramean, by not accepting from him what he brought. As surely as the Lord lives, I will run after him and get something from him.”
12005021 So Gehazi hurried after Naaman. When Naaman saw him running toward him, he got down from the chariot to meet him. “Is everything all right?” he asked.
12005022 “Everything is all right,” Gehazi answered. “My master sent me to say, ‘Two young men from the company of the prophets have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two sets of clothing.’ ”
12005023 “By all means, take two talents,” said Naaman. He urged Gehazi to accept them, and then tied up the two talents of silver in two bags, with two sets of clothing. He gave them to two of his servants, and they carried them ahead of Gehazi.
12005024 When Gehazi came to the hill, he took the things from the servants and put them away in the house. He sent the men away and they left.
12005025 When he went in and stood before his master, Elisha asked him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?” “Your servant didn’t go anywhere,” Gehazi answered.
12005026 But Elisha said to him, “Was not my spirit with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to take money or to accept clothes—or olive groves and vineyards, or flocks and herds, or male and female slaves?
12005027 Naaman’s leprosy will cling to you and to your descendants forever.” Then Gehazi went from Elisha’s presence and his skin was leprous—it had become as white as snow.
12006001 The company of the prophets said to Elisha, “Look, the place where we meet with you is too small for us.
12006002 Let us go to the Jordan, where each of us can get a pole; and let us build a place there for us to meet.” And he said, “Go.”
12006003 Then one of them said, “Won’t you please come with your servants?” “I will,” Elisha replied.
12006004 And he went with them. They went to the Jordan and began to cut down trees.
12006005 As one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron axhead fell into the water. “Oh no, my lord!” he cried out. “It was borrowed!”
12006006 The man of God asked, “Where did it fall?” When he showed him the place, Elisha cut a stick and threw it there, and made the iron float.
12006007 “Lift it out,” he said. Then the man reached out his hand and took it.
12006008 Now the king of Aram was at war with Israel. After conferring with his officers, he said, “I will set up my camp in such and such a place.”
12006009 The man of God sent word to the king of Israel: “Beware of passing that place, because the Arameans are going down there.”
12006010 So the king of Israel checked on the place indicated by the man of God. Time and again Elisha warned the king, so that he was on his guard in such places.
12006011 This enraged the king of Aram. He summoned his officers and demanded of them, “Tell me! Which of us is on the side of the king of Israel?”
12006012 “None of us, my lord the king,” said one of his officers, “but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the very words you speak in your bedroom.”
12006013 “Go, find out where he is,” the king ordered, “so I can send men and capture him.” The report came back: “He is in Dothan.”
12006014 Then he sent horses and chariots and a strong force there. They went by night and surrounded the city.
12006015 When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. “Oh no, my lord! What shall we do?” the servant asked.
12006016 “Don’t be afraid,” the prophet answered. “Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”
12006017 And Elisha prayed, “Open his eyes, Lord, so that he may see.” Then the Lord opened the servant’s eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
12006018 As the enemy came down toward him, Elisha prayed to the Lord, “Strike this army with blindness.” So he struck them with blindness, as Elisha had asked.
12006019 Elisha told them, “This is not the road and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you are looking for.” And he led them to Samaria.
12006020 After they entered the city, Elisha said, “Lord, open the eyes of these men so they can see.” Then the Lord opened their eyes and they looked, and there they were, inside Samaria.
12006021 When the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, “Shall I kill them, my father? Shall I kill them?”
12006022 “Do not kill them,” he answered. “Would you kill those you have captured with your own sword or bow? Set food and water before them so that they may eat and drink and then go back to their master.”
12006023 So he prepared a great feast for them, and after they had finished eating and drinking, he sent them away, and they returned to their master. So the bands from Aram stopped raiding Israel’s territory.
12006024 Some time later, Ben-Hadad king of Aram mobilized his entire army and marched up and laid siege to Samaria.
12006025 There was a great famine in the city; the siege lasted so long that a donkey’s head sold for eighty shekels of silver, and a quarter of a cab of seed pods for five shekels.
12006026 As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, “Help me, my lord the king!”
12006027 The king replied, “If the Lord does not help you, where can I get help for you? From the threshing floor? From the winepress?”
12006028 Then he asked her, “What’s the matter?” She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give up your son so we may eat him today, and tomorrow we’ll eat my son.’
12006029 So we cooked my son and ate him. The next day I said to her, ‘Give up your son so we may eat him,’ but she had hidden him.”
12006030 When the king heard the woman’s words, he tore his robes. As he went along the wall, the people looked, and they saw that, under his robes, he had sackcloth on his body.
12006031 He said, “May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today!”
12006032 Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a messenger ahead, but before he arrived, Elisha said to the elders, “Don’t you see how this murderer is sending someone to cut off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold it shut against him. Is not the sound of his master’s footsteps behind him?”
12006033 While he was still talking to them, the messenger came down to him. The king said, “This disaster is from the Lord. Why should I wait for the Lord any longer?”
12007001 Elisha replied, “Hear the word of the Lord. This is what the Lord says: About this time tomorrow, a seah of the finest flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria.”
12007002 The officer on whose arm the king was leaning said to the man of God, “Look, even if the Lord should open the floodgates of the heavens, could this happen?” “You will see it with your own eyes,” answered Elisha, “but you will not eat any of it!”
12007003 Now there were four men with leprosy at the entrance of the city gate. They said to each other, “Why stay here until we die?
12007004 If we say, ‘We’ll go into the city’—the famine is there, and we will die. And if we stay here, we will die. So let’s go over to the camp of the Arameans and surrender. If they spare us, we live; if they kill us, then we die.”
12007005 At dusk they got up and went to the camp of the Arameans. When they reached the edge of the camp, no one was there,
12007006 for the Lord had caused the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots and horses and a great army, so that they said to one another, “Look, the king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to attack us!”
12007007 So they got up and fled in the dusk and abandoned their tents and their horses and donkeys. They left the camp as it was and ran for their lives.
12007008 The men who had leprosy reached the edge of the camp, entered one of the tents and ate and drank. Then they took silver, gold and clothes, and went off and hid them. They returned and entered another tent and took some things from it and hid them also.
12007009 Then they said to each other, “What we’re doing is not right. This is a day of good news and we are keeping it to ourselves. If we wait until daylight, punishment will overtake us. Let’s go at once and report this to the royal palace.”
12007010 So they went and called out to the city gatekeepers and told them, “We went into the Aramean camp and no one was there—not a sound of anyone—only tethered horses and donkeys, and the tents left just as they were.”
12007011 The gatekeepers shouted the news, and it was reported within the palace.
12007012 The king got up in the night and said to his officers, “I will tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know we are starving; so they have left the camp to hide in the countryside, thinking, ‘They will surely come out, and then we will take them alive and get into the city.’ ”
12007013 One of his officers answered, “Have some men take five of the horses that are left in the city. Their plight will be like that of all the Israelites left here—yes, they will only be like all these Israelites who are doomed. So let us send them to find out what happened.”
12007014 So they selected two chariots with their horses, and the king sent them after the Aramean army. He commanded the drivers, “Go and find out what has happened.”
12007015 They followed them as far as the Jordan, and they found the whole road strewn with the clothing and equipment the Arameans had thrown away in their headlong flight. So the messengers returned and reported to the king.
12007016 Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. So a seah of the finest flour sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley sold for a shekel, as the Lord had said.
12007017 Now the king had put the officer on whose arm he leaned in charge of the gate, and the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died, just as the man of God had foretold when the king came down to his house.
12007018 It happened as the man of God had said to the king: “About this time tomorrow, a seah of the finest flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria.”
12007019 The officer had said to the man of God, “Look, even if the Lord should open the floodgates of the heavens, could this happen?” The man of God had replied, “You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it!”
12007020 And that is exactly what happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died.
12008001 Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life, “Go away with your family and stay for a while wherever you can, because the Lord has decreed a famine in the land that will last seven years.”
12008002 The woman proceeded to do as the man of God said. She and her family went away and stayed in the land of the Philistines seven years.
12008003 At the end of the seven years she came back from the land of the Philistines and went to appeal to the king for her house and land.
12008004 The king was talking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, and had said, “Tell me about all the great things Elisha has done.”
12008005 Just as Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had restored the dead to life, the woman whose son Elisha had brought back to life came to appeal to the king for her house and land. Gehazi said, “This is the woman, my lord the king, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life.”
12008006 The king asked the woman about it, and she told him. Then he assigned an official to her case and said to him, “Give back everything that belonged to her, including all the income from her land from the day she left the country until now.”
12008007 Elisha went to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad king of Aram was ill. When the king was told, “The man of God has come all the way up here,”
12008008 he said to Hazael, “Take a gift with you and go to meet the man of God. Consult the Lord through him; ask him, ‘Will I recover from this illness?’ ”
12008009 Hazael went to meet Elisha, taking with him as a gift forty camel-loads of all the finest wares of Damascus. He went in and stood before him, and said, “Your son Ben-Hadad king of Aram has sent me to ask, ‘Will I recover from this illness?’ ”
12008010 Elisha answered, “Go and say to him, ‘You will certainly recover.’ Nevertheless, the Lord has revealed to me that he will in fact die.”
12008011 He stared at him with a fixed gaze until Hazael was embarrassed. Then the man of God began to weep.
12008012 “Why is my lord weeping?” asked Hazael. “Because I know the harm you will do to the Israelites,” he answered. “You will set fire to their fortified places, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little children to the ground, and rip open their pregnant women.”
12008013 Hazael said, “How could your servant, a mere dog, accomplish such a feat?” “The Lord has shown me that you will become king of Aram,” answered Elisha.
12008014 Then Hazael left Elisha and returned to his master. When Ben-Hadad asked, “What did Elisha say to you?” Hazael replied, “He told me that you would certainly recover.”
12008015 But the next day he took a thick cloth, soaked it in water and spread it over the king’s face, so that he died. Then Hazael succeeded him as king.
12008016 In the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, when Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat began his reign as king of Judah.
12008017 He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.
12008018 He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the Lord.
12008019 Nevertheless, for the sake of his servant David, the Lord was not willing to destroy Judah. He had promised to maintain a lamp for David and his descendants forever.
12008020 In the time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king.
12008021 So Jehoram went to Zair with all his chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he rose up and broke through by night; his army, however, fled back home.
12008022 To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah. Libnah revolted at the same time.
12008023 As for the other events of Jehoram’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
12008024 Jehoram rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king.
12008025 In the twelfth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.
12008026 Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother’s name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel.
12008027 He followed the ways of the house of Ahab and did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as the house of Ahab had done, for he was related by marriage to Ahab’s family.
12008028 Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram;
12008029 so King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramoth in his battle with Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Joram son of Ahab, because he had been wounded.
12009001 The prophet Elisha summoned a man from the company of the prophets and said to him, “Tuck your cloak into your belt, take this flask of olive oil with you and go to Ramoth Gilead.
12009002 When you get there, look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go to him, get him away from his companions and take him into an inner room.
12009003 Then take the flask and pour the oil on his head and declare, ‘This is what the Lord says: I anoint you king over Israel.’ Then open the door and run; don’t delay!”
12009004 So the young prophet went to Ramoth Gilead.
12009005 When he arrived, he found the army officers sitting together. “I have a message for you, commander,” he said. “For which of us?” asked Jehu. “For you, commander,” he replied.
12009006 Jehu got up and went into the house. Then the prophet poured the oil on Jehu’s head and declared, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anoint you king over the Lord’s people Israel.
12009007 You are to destroy the house of Ahab your master, and I will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the Lord’s servants shed by Jezebel.
12009008 The whole house of Ahab will perish. I will cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel—slave or free.
12009009 I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah.
12009010 As for Jezebel, dogs will devour her on the plot of ground at Jezreel, and no one will bury her.’ ” Then he opened the door and ran.
12009011 When Jehu went out to his fellow officers, one of them asked him, “Is everything all right? Why did this maniac come to you?” “You know the man and the sort of things he says,” Jehu replied.
12009012 “That’s not true!” they said. “Tell us.” Jehu said, “Here is what he told me: ‘This is what the Lord says: I anoint you king over Israel.’ ”
12009013 They quickly took their cloaks and spread them under him on the bare steps. Then they blew the trumpet and shouted, “Jehu is king!”
12009014 So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth Gilead against Hazael king of Aram,
12009015 but King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him in the battle with Hazael king of Aram.) Jehu said, “If you desire to make me king, don’t let anyone slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel.”
12009016 Then he got into his chariot and rode to Jezreel, because Joram was resting there and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him.
12009017 When the lookout standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu’s troops approaching, he called out, “I see some troops coming.” “Get a horseman,” Joram ordered. “Send him to meet them and ask, ‘Do you come in peace?’ ”
12009018 The horseman rode off to meet Jehu and said, “This is what the king says: ‘Do you come in peace?’ ” “What do you have to do with peace?” Jehu replied. “Fall in behind me.” The lookout reported, “The messenger has reached them, but he isn’t coming back.”
12009019 So the king sent out a second horseman. When he came to them he said, “This is what the king says: ‘Do you come in peace?’ ” Jehu replied, “What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me.”
12009020 The lookout reported, “He has reached them, but he isn’t coming back either. The driving is like that of Jehu son of Nimshi—he drives like a maniac.”
12009021 “Hitch up my chariot,” Joram ordered. And when it was hitched up, Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah rode out, each in his own chariot, to meet Jehu. They met him at the plot of ground that had belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite.
12009022 When Joram saw Jehu he asked, “Have you come in peace, Jehu?” “How can there be peace,” Jehu replied, “as long as all the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound?”
12009023 Joram turned about and fled, calling out to Ahaziah, “Treachery, Ahaziah!”
12009024 Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart and he slumped down in his chariot.
12009025 Jehu said to Bidkar, his chariot officer, “Pick him up and throw him on the field that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember how you and I were riding together in chariots behind Ahab his father when the Lord spoke this prophecy against him:
12009026 ‘Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, declares the Lord, and I will surely make you pay for it on this plot of ground, declares the Lord.’ Now then, pick him up and throw him on that plot, in accordance with the word of the Lord.”
12009027 When Ahaziah king of Judah saw what had happened, he fled up the road to Beth Haggan. Jehu chased him, shouting, “Kill him too!” They wounded him in his chariot on the way up to Gur near Ibleam, but he escaped to Megiddo and died there.
12009028 His servants took him by chariot to Jerusalem and buried him with his ancestors in his tomb in the City of David.
12009029 (In the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king of Judah.)
12009030 Then Jehu went to Jezreel. When Jezebel heard about it, she put on eye makeup, arranged her hair and looked out of a window.
12009031 As Jehu entered the gate, she asked, “Have you come in peace, you Zimri, you murderer of your master?”
12009032 He looked up at the window and called out, “Who is on my side? Who?” Two or three eunuchs looked down at him.
12009033 “Throw her down!” Jehu said. So they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered the wall and the horses as they trampled her underfoot.
12009034 Jehu went in and ate and drank. “Take care of that cursed woman,” he said, “and bury her, for she was a king’s daughter.”
12009035 But when they went out to bury her, they found nothing except her skull, her feet and her hands.
12009036 They went back and told Jehu, who said, “This is the word of the Lord that he spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite: On the plot of ground at Jezreel dogs will devour Jezebel’s flesh.
12009037 Jezebel’s body will be like dung on the ground in the plot at Jezreel, so that no one will be able to say, ‘This is Jezebel.’ ”
12010001 Now there were in Samaria seventy sons of the house of Ahab. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria: to the officials of Jezreel, to the elders and to the guardians of Ahab’s children. He said,
12010002 “You have your master’s sons with you and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city and weapons. Now as soon as this letter reaches you,
12010003 choose the best and most worthy of your master’s sons and set him on his father’s throne. Then fight for your master’s house.”
12010004 But they were terrified and said, “If two kings could not resist him, how can we?”
12010005 So the palace administrator, the city governor, the elders and the guardians sent this message to Jehu: “We are your servants and we will do anything you say. We will not appoint anyone as king; you do whatever you think best.”
12010006 Then Jehu wrote them a second letter, saying, “If you are on my side and will obey me, take the heads of your master’s sons and come to me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow.” Now the royal princes, seventy of them, were with the leading men of the city, who were rearing them.
12010007 When the letter arrived, these men took the princes and slaughtered all seventy of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel.
12010008 When the messenger arrived, he told Jehu, “They have brought the heads of the princes.” Then Jehu ordered, “Put them in two piles at the entrance of the city gate until morning.”
12010009 The next morning Jehu went out. He stood before all the people and said, “You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these?
12010010 Know, then, that not a word the Lord has spoken against the house of Ahab will fail. The Lord has done what he announced through his servant Elijah.”
12010011 So Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab, as well as all his chief men, his close friends and his priests, leaving him no survivor.
12010012 Jehu then set out and went toward Samaria. At Beth Eked of the Shepherds,
12010013 he met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and asked, “Who are you?” They said, “We are relatives of Ahaziah, and we have come down to greet the families of the king and of the queen mother.”
12010014 “Take them alive!” he ordered. So they took them alive and slaughtered them by the well of Beth Eked—forty-two of them. He left no survivor.
12010015 After he left there, he came upon Jehonadab son of Rekab, who was on his way to meet him. Jehu greeted him and said, “Are you in accord with me, as I am with you?” “I am,” Jehonadab answered. “If so,” said Jehu, “give me your hand.” So he did, and Jehu helped him up into the chariot.
12010016 Jehu said, “Come with me and see my zeal for the Lord.” Then he had him ride along in his chariot.
12010017 When Jehu came to Samaria, he killed all who were left there of Ahab’s family; he destroyed them, according to the word of the Lord spoken to Elijah.
12010018 Then Jehu brought all the people together and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much.
12010019 Now summon all the prophets of Baal, all his servants and all his priests. See that no one is missing, because I am going to hold a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who fails to come will no longer live.” But Jehu was acting deceptively in order to destroy the servants of Baal.
12010020 Jehu said, “Call an assembly in honor of Baal.” So they proclaimed it.
12010021 Then he sent word throughout Israel, and all the servants of Baal came; not one stayed away. They crowded into the temple of Baal until it was full from one end to the other.
12010022 And Jehu said to the keeper of the wardrobe, “Bring robes for all the servants of Baal.” So he brought out robes for them.
12010023 Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rekab went into the temple of Baal. Jehu said to the servants of Baal, “Look around and see that no one who serves the Lord is here with you—only servants of Baal.”
12010024 So they went in to make sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had posted eighty men outside with this warning: “If one of you lets any of the men I am placing in your hands escape, it will be your life for his life.”
12010025 As soon as Jehu had finished making the burnt offering, he ordered the guards and officers: “Go in and kill them; let no one escape.” So they cut them down with the sword. The guards and officers threw the bodies out and then entered the inner shrine of the temple of Baal.
12010026 They brought the sacred stone out of the temple of Baal and burned it.
12010027 They demolished the sacred stone of Baal and tore down the temple of Baal, and people have used it for a latrine to this day.
12010028 So Jehu destroyed Baal worship in Israel.
12010029 However, he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit—the worship of the golden calves at Bethel and Dan.
12010030 The Lord said to Jehu, “Because you have done well in accomplishing what is right in my eyes and have done to the house of Ahab all I had in mind to do, your descendants will sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.”
12010031 Yet Jehu was not careful to keep the law of the Lord, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, which he had caused Israel to commit.
12010032 In those days the Lord began to reduce the size of Israel. Hazael overpowered the Israelites throughout their territory
12010033 east of the Jordan in all the land of Gilead (the region of Gad, Reuben and Manasseh), from Aroer by the Arnon Gorge through Gilead to Bashan.
12010034 As for the other events of Jehu’s reign, all he did, and all his achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
12010035 Jehu rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son succeeded him as king.
12010036 The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
12011001 When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to destroy the whole royal family.
12011002 But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram and sister of Ahaziah, took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the royal princes, who were about to be murdered. She put him and his nurse in a bedroom to hide him from Athaliah; so he was not killed.
12011003 He remained hidden with his nurse at the temple of the Lord for six years while Athaliah ruled the land.
12011004 In the seventh year Jehoiada sent for the commanders of units of a hundred, the Carites and the guards and had them brought to him at the temple of the Lord. He made a covenant with them and put them under oath at the temple of the Lord. Then he showed them the king’s son.
12011005 He commanded them, saying, “This is what you are to do: You who are in the three companies that are going on duty on the Sabbath—a third of you guarding the royal palace,
12011006 a third at the Sur Gate, and a third at the gate behind the guard, who take turns guarding the temple—
12011007 and you who are in the other two companies that normally go off Sabbath duty are all to guard the temple for the king.
12011008 Station yourselves around the king, each of you with weapon in hand. Anyone who approaches your ranks is to be put to death. Stay close to the king wherever he goes.”
12011009 The commanders of units of a hundred did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each one took his men—those who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off duty—and came to Jehoiada the priest.
12011010 Then he gave the commanders the spears and shields that had belonged to King David and that were in the temple of the Lord.
12011011 The guards, each with weapon in hand, stationed themselves around the king—near the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple.
12011012 Jehoiada brought out the king’s son and put the crown on him; he presented him with a copy of the covenant and proclaimed him king. They anointed him, and the people clapped their hands and shouted, “Long live the king!”
12011013 When Athaliah heard the noise made by the guards and the people, she went to the people at the temple of the Lord.
12011014 She looked and there was the king, standing by the pillar, as the custom was. The officers and the trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her robes and called out, “Treason! Treason!”
12011015 Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders of units of a hundred, who were in charge of the troops: “Bring her out between the ranks and put to the sword anyone who follows her.” For the priest had said, “She must not be put to death in the temple of the Lord.”
12011016 So they seized her as she reached the place where the horses enter the palace grounds, and there she was put to death.
12011017 Jehoiada then made a covenant between the Lord and the king and people that they would be the Lord’s people. He also made a covenant between the king and the people.
12011018 All the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols to pieces and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars. Then Jehoiada the priest posted guards at the temple of the Lord.
12011019 He took with him the commanders of hundreds, the Carites, the guards and all the people of the land, and together they brought the king down from the temple of the Lord and went into the palace, entering by way of the gate of the guards. The king then took his place on the royal throne.
12011020 All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was calm, because Athaliah had been slain with the sword at the palace.
12011021 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign.
12012001 In the seventh year of Jehu, Joash became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother’s name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba.
12012002 Joash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord all the years Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
12012003 The high places, however, were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.
12012004 Joash said to the priests, “Collect all the money that is brought as sacred offerings to the temple of the Lord—the money collected in the census, the money received from personal vows and the money brought voluntarily to the temple.
12012005 Let every priest receive the money from one of the treasurers, then use it to repair whatever damage is found in the temple.”
12012006 But by the twenty-third year of King Joash the priests still had not repaired the temple.
12012007 Therefore King Joash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and asked them, “Why aren’t you repairing the damage done to the temple? Take no more money from your treasurers, but hand it over for repairing the temple.”
12012008 The priests agreed that they would not collect any more money from the people and that they would not repair the temple themselves.
12012009 Jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in its lid. He placed it beside the altar, on the right side as one enters the temple of the Lord. The priests who guarded the entrance put into the chest all the money that was brought to the temple of the Lord.
12012010 Whenever they saw that there was a large amount of money in the chest, the royal secretary and the high priest came, counted the money that had been brought into the temple of the Lord and put it into bags.
12012011 When the amount had been determined, they gave the money to the men appointed to supervise the work on the temple. With it they paid those who worked on the temple of the Lord—the carpenters and builders,
12012012 the masons and stonecutters. They purchased timber and blocks of dressed stone for the repair of the temple of the Lord, and met all the other expenses of restoring the temple.
12012013 The money brought into the temple was not spent for making silver basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, trumpets or any other articles of gold or silver for the temple of the Lord;
12012014 it was paid to the workers, who used it to repair the temple.
12012015 They did not require an accounting from those to whom they gave the money to pay the workers, because they acted with complete honesty.
12012016 The money from the guilt offerings and sin offerings was not brought into the temple of the Lord; it belonged to the priests.
12012017 About this time Hazael king of Aram went up and attacked Gath and captured it. Then he turned to attack Jerusalem.
12012018 But Joash king of Judah took all the sacred objects dedicated by his predecessors—Jehoshaphat, Jehoram and Ahaziah, the kings of Judah—and the gifts he himself had dedicated and all the gold found in the treasuries of the temple of the Lord and of the royal palace, and he sent them to Hazael king of Aram, who then withdrew from Jerusalem.
12012019 As for the other events of the reign of Joash, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
12012020 His officials conspired against him and assassinated him at Beth Millo, on the road down to Silla.
12012021 The officials who murdered him were Jozabad son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer. He died and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. And Amaziah his son succeeded him as king.
12013001 In the twenty-third year of Joash son of Ahaziah king of Judah, Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned seventeen years.
12013002 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord by following the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit, and he did not turn away from them.
12013003 So the Lord’s anger burned against Israel, and for a long time he kept them under the power of Hazael king of Aram and Ben-Hadad his son.
12013004 Then Jehoahaz sought the Lord’s favor, and the Lord listened to him, for he saw how severely the king of Aram was oppressing Israel.
12013005 The Lord provided a deliverer for Israel, and they escaped from the power of Aram. So the Israelites lived in their own homes as they had before.
12013006 But they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, which he had caused Israel to commit; they continued in them. Also, the Asherah pole remained standing in Samaria.
12013007 Nothing had been left of the army of Jehoahaz except fifty horsemen, ten chariots and ten thousand foot soldiers, for the king of Aram had destroyed the rest and made them like the dust at threshing time.
12013008 As for the other events of the reign of Jehoahaz, all he did and his achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
12013009 Jehoahaz rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria. And Jehoash his son succeeded him as king.
12013010 In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned sixteen years.
12013011 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord and did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit; he continued in them.
12013012 As for the other events of the reign of Jehoash, all he did and his achievements, including his war against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
12013013 Jehoash rested with his ancestors, and Jeroboam succeeded him on the throne. Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
12013014 Now Elisha had been suffering from the illness from which he died. Jehoash king of Israel went down to see him and wept over him. “My father! My father!” he cried. “The chariots and horsemen of Israel!”
12013015 Elisha said, “Get a bow and some arrows,” and he did so.
12013016 “Take the bow in your hands,” he said to the king of Israel. When he had taken it, Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands.
12013017 “Open the east window,” he said, and he opened it. “Shoot!” Elisha said, and he shot. “The Lord’s arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Aram!” Elisha declared. “You will completely destroy the Arameans at Aphek.”
12013018 Then he said, “Take the arrows,” and the king took them. Elisha told him, “Strike the ground.” He struck it three times and stopped.
12013019 The man of God was angry with him and said, “You should have struck the ground five or six times; then you would have defeated Aram and completely destroyed it. But now you will defeat it only three times.”
12013020 Elisha died and was buried. Now Moabite raiders used to enter the country every spring.
12013021 Once while some Israelites were burying a man, suddenly they saw a band of raiders; so they threw the man’s body into Elisha’s tomb. When the body touched Elisha’s bones, the man came to life and stood up on his feet.
12013022 Hazael king of Aram oppressed Israel throughout the reign of Jehoahaz.
12013023 But the Lord was gracious to them and had compassion and showed concern for them because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. To this day he has been unwilling to destroy them or banish them from his presence.
12013024 Hazael king of Aram died, and Ben-Hadad his son succeeded him as king.
12013025 Then Jehoash son of Jehoahaz recaptured from Ben-Hadad son of Hazael the towns he had taken in battle from his father Jehoahaz. Three times Jehoash defeated him, and so he recovered the Israelite towns.
12014001 In the second year of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel, Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah began to reign.
12014002 He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem.
12014003 He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, but not as his father David had done. In everything he followed the example of his father Joash.
12014004 The high places, however, were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.
12014005 After the kingdom was firmly in his grasp, he executed the officials who had murdered his father the king.
12014006 Yet he did not put the children of the assassins to death, in accordance with what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses where the Lord commanded: “Parents are not to be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their parents; each will die for their own sin.”
12014007 He was the one who defeated ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt and captured Sela in battle, calling it Joktheel, the name it has to this day.
12014008 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, with the challenge: “Come, let us face each other in battle.”
12014009 But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: “A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot.
12014010 You have indeed defeated Edom and now you are arrogant. Glory in your victory, but stay at home! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah also?”
12014011 Amaziah, however, would not listen, so Jehoash king of Israel attacked. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth Shemesh in Judah.
12014012 Judah was routed by Israel, and every man fled to his home.
12014013 Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh. Then Jehoash went to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate—a section about four hundred cubits long.
12014014 He took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the temple of the Lord and in the treasuries of the royal palace. He also took hostages and returned to Samaria.
12014015 As for the other events of the reign of Jehoash, what he did and his achievements, including his war against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
12014016 Jehoash rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. And Jeroboam his son succeeded him as king.
12014017 Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.
12014018 As for the other events of Amaziah’s reign, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
12014019 They conspired against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish, but they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him there.
12014020 He was brought back by horse and was buried in Jerusalem with his ancestors, in the City of David.
12014021 Then all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
12014022 He was the one who rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah after Amaziah rested with his ancestors.
12014023 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam son of Jehoash king of Israel became king in Samaria, and he reigned forty-one years.
12014024 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord and did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit.
12014025 He was the one who restored the boundaries of Israel from Lebo Hamath to the Dead Sea, in accordance with the word of the Lord, the God of Israel, spoken through his servant Jonah son of Amittai, the prophet from Gath Hepher.
12014026 The Lord had seen how bitterly everyone in Israel, whether slave or free, was suffering; there was no one to help them.
12014027 And since the Lord had not said he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam son of Jehoash.
12014028 As for the other events of Jeroboam’s reign, all he did, and his military achievements, including how he recovered for Israel both Damascus and Hamath, which had belonged to Judah, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
12014029 Jeroboam rested with his ancestors, the kings of Israel. And Zechariah his son succeeded him as king.
12015001 In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah began to reign.
12015002 He was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother’s name was Jekoliah; she was from Jerusalem.
12015003 He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, just as his father Amaziah had done.
12015004 The high places, however, were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.
12015005 The Lord afflicted the king with leprosy until the day he died, and he lived in a separate house. Jotham the king’s son had charge of the palace and governed the people of the land.
12015006 As for the other events of Azariah’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
12015007 Azariah rested with his ancestors and was buried near them in the City of David. And Jotham his son succeeded him as king.
12015008 In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zechariah son of Jeroboam became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned six months.
12015009 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as his predecessors had done. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit.
12015010 Shallum son of Jabesh conspired against Zechariah. He attacked him in front of the people, assassinated him and succeeded him as king.
12015011 The other events of Zechariah’s reign are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.
12015012 So the word of the Lord spoken to Jehu was fulfilled: “Your descendants will sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.”
12015013 Shallum son of Jabesh became king in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah, and he reigned in Samaria one month.
12015014 Then Menahem son of Gadi went from Tirzah up to Samaria. He attacked Shallum son of Jabesh in Samaria, assassinated him and succeeded him as king.
12015015 The other events of Shallum’s reign, and the conspiracy he led, are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.
12015016 At that time Menahem, starting out from Tirzah, attacked Tiphsah and everyone in the city and its vicinity, because they refused to open their gates. He sacked Tiphsah and ripped open all the pregnant women.
12015017 In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem son of Gadi became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria ten years.
12015018 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord. During his entire reign he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit.
12015019 Then Pul king of Assyria invaded the land, and Menahem gave him a thousand talents of silver to gain his support and strengthen his own hold on the kingdom.
12015020 Menahem exacted this money from Israel. Every wealthy person had to contribute fifty shekels of silver to be given to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria withdrew and stayed in the land no longer.
12015021 As for the other events of Menahem’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
12015022 Menahem rested with his ancestors. And Pekahiah his son succeeded him as king.
12015023 In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah son of Menahem became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned two years.
12015024 Pekahiah did evil in the eyes of the Lord. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit.
12015025 One of his chief officers, Pekah son of Remaliah, conspired against him. Taking fifty men of Gilead with him, he assassinated Pekahiah, along with Argob and Arieh, in the citadel of the royal palace at Samaria. So Pekah killed Pekahiah and succeeded him as king.
12015026 The other events of Pekahiah’s reign, and all he did, are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.
12015027 In the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah son of Remaliah became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned twenty years.
12015028 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit.
12015029 In the time of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came and took Ijon, Abel Beth Maakah, Janoah, Kedesh and Hazor. He took Gilead and Galilee, including all the land of Naphtali, and deported the people to Assyria.
12015030 Then Hoshea son of Elah conspired against Pekah son of Remaliah. He attacked and assassinated him, and then succeeded him as king in the twentieth year of Jotham son of Uzziah.
12015031 As for the other events of Pekah’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
12015032 In the second year of Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel, Jotham son of Uzziah king of Judah began to reign.
12015033 He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. His mother’s name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok.
12015034 He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, just as his father Uzziah had done.
12015035 The high places, however, were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there. Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the temple of the Lord.
12015036 As for the other events of Jotham’s reign, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
12015037 (In those days the Lord began to send Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah against Judah.)
12015038 Jotham rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David, the city of his father. And Ahaz his son succeeded him as king.
12016001 In the seventeenth year of Pekah son of Remaliah, Ahaz son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.
12016002 Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. Unlike David his father, he did not do what was right in the eyes of the Lord his God.
12016003 He followed the ways of the kings of Israel and even sacrificed his son in the fire, engaging in the detestable practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites.
12016004 He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places, on the hilltops and under every spreading tree.
12016005 Then Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel marched up to fight against Jerusalem and besieged Ahaz, but they could not overpower him.
12016006 At that time, Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath for Aram by driving out the people of Judah. Edomites then moved into Elath and have lived there to this day.
12016007 Ahaz sent messengers to say to Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, “I am your servant and vassal. Come up and save me out of the hand of the king of Aram and of the king of Israel, who are attacking me.”
12016008 And Ahaz took the silver and gold found in the temple of the Lord and in the treasuries of the royal palace and sent it as a gift to the king of Assyria.
12016009 The king of Assyria complied by attacking Damascus and capturing it. He deported its inhabitants to Kir and put Rezin to death.
12016010 Then King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria. He saw an altar in Damascus and sent to Uriah the priest a sketch of the altar, with detailed plans for its construction.
12016011 So Uriah the priest built an altar in accordance with all the plans that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus and finished it before King Ahaz returned.
12016012 When the king came back from Damascus and saw the altar, he approached it and presented offerings on it.
12016013 He offered up his burnt offering and grain offering, poured out his drink offering, and splashed the blood of his fellowship offerings against the altar.
12016014 As for the bronze altar that stood before the Lord, he brought it from the front of the temple—from between the new altar and the temple of the Lord—and put it on the north side of the new altar.
12016015 King Ahaz then gave these orders to Uriah the priest: “On the large new altar, offer the morning burnt offering and the evening grain offering, the king’s burnt offering and his grain offering, and the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their grain offering and their drink offering. Splash against this altar the blood of all the burnt offerings and sacrifices. But I will use the bronze altar for seeking guidance.”
12016016 And Uriah the priest did just as King Ahaz had ordered.
12016017 King Ahaz cut off the side panels and removed the basins from the movable stands. He removed the Sea from the bronze bulls that supported it and set it on a stone base.
12016018 He took away the Sabbath canopy that had been built at the temple and removed the royal entryway outside the temple of the Lord, in deference to the king of Assyria.
12016019 As for the other events of the reign of Ahaz, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
12016020 Ahaz rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. And Hezekiah his son succeeded him as king.
12017001 In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea son of Elah became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned nine years.
12017002 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, but not like the kings of Israel who preceded him.
12017003 Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up to attack Hoshea, who had been Shalmaneser’s vassal and had paid him tribute.
12017004 But the king of Assyria discovered that Hoshea was a traitor, for he had sent envoys to So king of Egypt, and he no longer paid tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore Shalmaneser seized him and put him in prison.
12017005 The king of Assyria invaded the entire land, marched against Samaria and laid siege to it for three years.
12017006 In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the Israelites to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River and in the towns of the Medes.
12017007 All this took place because the Israelites had sinned against the Lord their God, who had brought them up out of Egypt from under the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt. They worshiped other gods
12017008 and followed the practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before them, as well as the practices that the kings of Israel had introduced.
12017009 The Israelites secretly did things against the Lord their God that were not right. From watchtower to fortified city they built themselves high places in all their towns.
12017010 They set up sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree.
12017011 At every high place they burned incense, as the nations whom the Lord had driven out before them had done. They did wicked things that aroused the Lord’s anger.
12017012 They worshiped idols, though the Lord had said, “You shall not do this.”
12017013 The Lord warned Israel and Judah through all his prophets and seers: “Turn from your evil ways. Observe my commands and decrees, in accordance with the entire Law that I commanded your ancestors to obey and that I delivered to you through my servants the prophets.”
12017014 But they would not listen and were as stiff-necked as their ancestors, who did not trust in the Lord their God.
12017015 They rejected his decrees and the covenant he had made with their ancestors and the statutes he had warned them to keep. They followed worthless idols and themselves became worthless. They imitated the nations around them although the Lord had ordered them, “Do not do as they do.”
12017016 They forsook all the commands of the Lord their God and made for themselves two idols cast in the shape of calves, and an Asherah pole. They bowed down to all the starry hosts, and they worshiped Baal.
12017017 They sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire. They practiced divination and sought omens and sold themselves to do evil in the eyes of the Lord, arousing his anger.
12017018 So the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them from his presence. Only the tribe of Judah was left,
12017019 and even Judah did not keep the commands of the Lord their God. They followed the practices Israel had introduced.
12017020 Therefore the Lord rejected all the people of Israel; he afflicted them and gave them into the hands of plunderers, until he thrust them from his presence.
12017021 When he tore Israel away from the house of David, they made Jeroboam son of Nebat their king. Jeroboam enticed Israel away from following the Lord and caused them to commit a great sin.
12017022 The Israelites persisted in all the sins of Jeroboam and did not turn away from them
12017023 until the Lord removed them from his presence, as he had warned through all his servants the prophets. So the people of Israel were taken from their homeland into exile in Assyria, and they are still there.
12017024 The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Kuthah, Avva, Hamath and Sepharvaim and settled them in the towns of Samaria to replace the Israelites. They took over Samaria and lived in its towns.
12017025 When they first lived there, they did not worship the Lord; so he sent lions among them and they killed some of the people.
12017026 It was reported to the king of Assyria: “The people you deported and resettled in the towns of Samaria do not know what the god of that country requires. He has sent lions among them, which are killing them off, because the people do not know what he requires.”
12017027 Then the king of Assyria gave this order: “Have one of the priests you took captive from Samaria go back to live there and teach the people what the god of the land requires.”
12017028 So one of the priests who had been exiled from Samaria came to live in Bethel and taught them how to worship the Lord.
12017029 Nevertheless, each national group made its own gods in the several towns where they settled, and set them up in the shrines the people of Samaria had made at the high places.
12017030 The people from Babylon made Sukkoth Benoth, those from Kuthah made Nergal, and those from Hamath made Ashima;
12017031 the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire as sacrifices to Adrammelek and Anammelek, the gods of Sepharvaim.
12017032 They worshiped the Lord, but they also appointed all sorts of their own people to officiate for them as priests in the shrines at the high places.
12017033 They worshiped the Lord, but they also served their own gods in accordance with the customs of the nations from which they had been brought.
12017034 To this day they persist in their former practices. They neither worship the Lord nor adhere to the decrees and regulations, the laws and commands that the Lord gave the descendants of Jacob, whom he named Israel.
12017035 When the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites, he commanded them: “Do not worship any other gods or bow down to them, serve them or sacrifice to them.
12017036 But the Lord, who brought you up out of Egypt with mighty power and outstretched arm, is the one you must worship. To him you shall bow down and to him offer sacrifices.
12017037 You must always be careful to keep the decrees and regulations, the laws and commands he wrote for you. Do not worship other gods.
12017038 Do not forget the covenant I have made with you, and do not worship other gods.
12017039 Rather, worship the Lord your God; it is he who will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies.”
12017040 They would not listen, however, but persisted in their former practices.
12017041 Even while these people were worshiping the Lord, they were serving their idols. To this day their children and grandchildren continue to do as their ancestors did.
12018001 In the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Hezekiah son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
12018002 He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah.
12018003 He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, just as his father David had done.
12018004 He removed the high places, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles. He broke into pieces the bronze snake Moses had made, for up to that time the Israelites had been burning incense to it. (It was called Nehushtan. )
12018005 Hezekiah trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel. There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, either before him or after him.
12018006 He held fast to the Lord and did not stop following him; he kept the commands the Lord had given Moses.
12018007 And the Lord was with him; he was successful in whatever he undertook. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him.
12018008 From watchtower to fortified city, he defeated the Philistines, as far as Gaza and its territory.
12018009 In King Hezekiah’s fourth year, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria marched against Samaria and laid siege to it.
12018010 At the end of three years the Assyrians took it. So Samaria was captured in Hezekiah’s sixth year, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel.
12018011 The king of Assyria deported Israel to Assyria and settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River and in towns of the Medes.
12018012 This happened because they had not obeyed the Lord their God, but had violated his covenant—all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded. They neither listened to the commands nor carried them out.
12018013 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah’s reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
12018014 So Hezekiah king of Judah sent this message to the king of Assyria at Lachish: “I have done wrong. Withdraw from me, and I will pay whatever you demand of me.” The king of Assyria exacted from Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
12018015 So Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the temple of the Lord and in the treasuries of the royal palace.
12018016 At this time Hezekiah king of Judah stripped off the gold with which he had covered the doors and doorposts of the temple of the Lord, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
12018017 The king of Assyria sent his supreme commander, his chief officer and his field commander with a large army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They came up to Jerusalem and stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Washerman’s Field.
12018018 They called for the king; and Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to them.
12018019 The field commander said to them, “Tell Hezekiah: “ ‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: On what are you basing this confidence of yours?
12018020 You say you have the counsel and the might for war—but you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me?
12018021 Look, I know you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him.
12018022 But if you say to me, “We are depending on the Lord our God”—isn’t he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, “You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem”?
12018023 “ ‘Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses—if you can put riders on them!
12018024 How can you repulse one officer of the least of my master’s officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen ?
12018025 Furthermore, have I come to attack and destroy this place without word from the Lord? The Lord himself told me to march against this country and destroy it.’ ”
12018026 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, and Shebna and Joah said to the field commander, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don’t speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall.”
12018027 But the commander replied, “Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the people sitting on the wall—who, like you, will have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine?”
12018028 Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew, “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!
12018029 This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you from my hand.
12018030 Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the Lord when he says, ‘The Lord will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’
12018031 “Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then each of you will eat fruit from your own vine and fig tree and drink water from your own cistern,
12018032 until I come and take you to a land like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey. Choose life and not death! “Do not listen to Hezekiah, for he is misleading you when he says, ‘The Lord will deliver us.’
12018033 Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
12018034 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand?
12018035 Who of all the gods of these countries has been able to save his land from me? How then can the Lord deliver Jerusalem from my hand?”
12018036 But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the king had commanded, “Do not answer him.”
12018037 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah, with their clothes torn, and told him what the field commander had said.
12019001 When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the Lord.
12019002 He sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
12019003 They told him, “This is what Hezekiah says: This day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace, as when children come to the moment of birth and there is no strength to deliver them.
12019004 It may be that the Lord your God will hear all the words of the field commander, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to ridicule the living God, and that he will rebuke him for the words the Lord your God has heard. Therefore pray for the remnant that still survives.”
12019005 When King Hezekiah’s officials came to Isaiah,
12019006 Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master, ‘This is what the Lord says: Do not be afraid of what you have heard—those words with which the underlings of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
12019007 Listen! When he hears a certain report, I will make him want to return to his own country, and there I will have him cut down with the sword.’ ”
12019008 When the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah.
12019009 Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah, the king of Cush, was marching out to fight against him. So he again sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word:
12019010 “Say to Hezekiah king of Judah: Do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says, ‘Jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria.’
12019011 Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries, destroying them completely. And will you be delivered?
12019012 Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my predecessors deliver them—the gods of Gozan, Harran, Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar?
12019013 Where is the king of Hamath or the king of Arpad? Where are the kings of Lair, Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah?”
12019014 Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the Lord and spread it out before the Lord.
12019015 And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord: “Lord, the God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.
12019016 Give ear, Lord, and hear; open your eyes, Lord, and see; listen to the words Sennacherib has sent to ridicule the living God.
12019017 “It is true, Lord, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste these nations and their lands.
12019018 They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by human hands.
12019019 Now, Lord our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone, Lord, are God.”
12019020 Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I have heard your prayer concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria.
12019021 This is the word that the Lord has spoken against him: “ ‘Virgin Daughter Zion despises you and mocks you. Daughter Jerusalem tosses her head as you flee.
12019022 Who is it you have ridiculed and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!
12019023 By your messengers you have ridiculed the Lord. And you have said, “With my many chariots I have ascended the heights of the mountains, the utmost heights of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, the choicest of its junipers. I have reached its remotest parts, the finest of its forests.
12019024 I have dug wells in foreign lands and drunk the water there. With the soles of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.”
12019025 “ ‘Have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it. In days of old I planned it; now I have brought it to pass, that you have turned fortified cities into piles of stone.
12019026 Their people, drained of power, are dismayed and put to shame. They are like plants in the field, like tender green shoots, like grass sprouting on the roof, scorched before it grows up.
12019027 “ ‘But I know where you are and when you come and go and how you rage against me.
12019028 Because you rage against me and because your insolence has reached my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will make you return by the way you came.’
12019029 “This will be the sign for you, Hezekiah: “This year you will eat what grows by itself, and the second year what springs from that. But in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
12019030 Once more a remnant of the kingdom of Judah will take root below and bear fruit above.
12019031 For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. “The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this.
12019032 “Therefore this is what the Lord says concerning the king of Assyria: “ ‘He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here. He will not come before it with shield or build a siege ramp against it.
12019033 By the way that he came he will return; he will not enter this city, declares the Lord.
12019034 I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant.’ ”
12019035 That night the angel of the Lord went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning—there were all the dead bodies!
12019036 So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.
12019037 One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisrok, his sons Adrammelek and Sharezer killed him with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king.
12020001 In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said, “This is what the Lord says: Put your house in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover.”
12020002 Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord,
12020003 “Remember, Lord, how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
12020004 Before Isaiah had left the middle court, the word of the Lord came to him:
12020005 “Go back and tell Hezekiah, the ruler of my people, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will heal you. On the third day from now you will go up to the temple of the Lord.
12020006 I will add fifteen years to your life. And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for my sake and for the sake of my servant David.’ ”
12020007 Then Isaiah said, “Prepare a poultice of figs.” They did so and applied it to the boil, and he recovered.
12020008 Hezekiah had asked Isaiah, “What will be the sign that the Lord will heal me and that I will go up to the temple of the Lord on the third day from now?”
12020009 Isaiah answered, “This is the Lord’s sign to you that the Lord will do what he has promised: Shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or shall it go back ten steps?”
12020010 “It is a simple matter for the shadow to go forward ten steps,” said Hezekiah. “Rather, have it go back ten steps.”
12020011 Then the prophet Isaiah called on the Lord, and the Lord made the shadow go back the ten steps it had gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.
12020012 At that time Marduk-Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent Hezekiah letters and a gift, because he had heard of Hezekiah’s illness.
12020013 Hezekiah received the envoys and showed them all that was in his storehouses—the silver, the gold, the spices and the fine olive oil—his armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.
12020014 Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked, “What did those men say, and where did they come from?” “From a distant land,” Hezekiah replied. “They came from Babylon.”
12020015 The prophet asked, “What did they see in your palace?” “They saw everything in my palace,” Hezekiah said. “There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them.”
12020016 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the Lord:
12020017 The time will surely come when everything in your palace, and all that your predecessors have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the Lord.
12020018 And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood who will be born to you, will be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”
12020019 “The word of the Lord you have spoken is good,” Hezekiah replied. For he thought, “Will there not be peace and security in my lifetime?”
12020020 As for the other events of Hezekiah’s reign, all his achievements and how he made the pool and the tunnel by which he brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
12020021 Hezekiah rested with his ancestors. And Manasseh his son succeeded him as king.
12021001 Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years. His mother’s name was Hephzibah.
12021002 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, following the detestable practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites.
12021003 He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he also erected altars to Baal and made an Asherah pole, as Ahab king of Israel had done. He bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshiped them.
12021004 He built altars in the temple of the Lord, of which the Lord had said, “In Jerusalem I will put my Name.”
12021005 In the two courts of the temple of the Lord, he built altars to all the starry hosts.
12021006 He sacrificed his own son in the fire, practiced divination, sought omens, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the Lord, arousing his anger.
12021007 He took the carved Asherah pole he had made and put it in the temple, of which the Lord had said to David and to his son Solomon, “In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my Name forever.
12021008 I will not again make the feet of the Israelites wander from the land I gave their ancestors, if only they will be careful to do everything I commanded them and will keep the whole Law that my servant Moses gave them.”
12021009 But the people did not listen. Manasseh led them astray, so that they did more evil than the nations the Lord had destroyed before the Israelites.
12021010 The Lord said through his servants the prophets:
12021011 “Manasseh king of Judah has committed these detestable sins. He has done more evil than the Amorites who preceded him and has led Judah into sin with his idols.
12021012 Therefore this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I am going to bring such disaster on Jerusalem and Judah that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle.
12021013 I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring line used against Samaria and the plumb line used against the house of Ahab. I will wipe out Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
12021014 I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance and give them into the hands of enemies. They will be looted and plundered by all their enemies;
12021015 they have done evil in my eyes and have aroused my anger from the day their ancestors came out of Egypt until this day.”
12021016 Moreover, Manasseh also shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem from end to end—besides the sin that he had caused Judah to commit, so that they did evil in the eyes of the Lord.
12021017 As for the other events of Manasseh’s reign, and all he did, including the sin he committed, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
12021018 Manasseh rested with his ancestors and was buried in his palace garden, the garden of Uzza. And Amon his son succeeded him as king.
12021019 Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years. His mother’s name was Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz; she was from Jotbah.
12021020 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Manasseh had done.
12021021 He followed completely the ways of his father, worshiping the idols his father had worshiped, and bowing down to them.
12021022 He forsook the Lord, the God of his ancestors, and did not walk in obedience to him.
12021023 Amon’s officials conspired against him and assassinated the king in his palace.
12021024 Then the people of the land killed all who had plotted against King Amon, and they made Josiah his son king in his place.
12021025 As for the other events of Amon’s reign, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
12021026 He was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza. And Josiah his son succeeded him as king.
12022001 Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years. His mother’s name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah; she was from Bozkath.
12022002 He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord and followed completely the ways of his father David, not turning aside to the right or to the left.
12022003 In the eighteenth year of his reign, King Josiah sent the secretary, Shaphan son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, to the temple of the Lord. He said:
12022004 “Go up to Hilkiah the high priest and have him get ready the money that has been brought into the temple of the Lord, which the doorkeepers have collected from the people.
12022005 Have them entrust it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the temple. And have these men pay the workers who repair the temple of the Lord—
12022006 the carpenters, the builders and the masons. Also have them purchase timber and dressed stone to repair the temple.
12022007 But they need not account for the money entrusted to them, because they are honest in their dealings.”
12022008 Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the Lord.” He gave it to Shaphan, who read it.
12022009 Then Shaphan the secretary went to the king and reported to him: “Your officials have paid out the money that was in the temple of the Lord and have entrusted it to the workers and supervisors at the temple.”
12022010 Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.
12022011 When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his robes.
12022012 He gave these orders to Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Akbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the king’s attendant:
12022013 “Go and inquire of the Lord for me and for the people and for all Judah about what is written in this book that has been found. Great is the Lord’s anger that burns against us because those who have gone before us have not obeyed the words of this book; they have not acted in accordance with all that is written there concerning us.”
12022014 Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Akbor, Shaphan and Asaiah went to speak to the prophet Huldah, who was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the New Quarter.
12022015 She said to them, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Tell the man who sent you to me,
12022016 ‘This is what the Lord says: I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people, according to everything written in the book the king of Judah has read.
12022017 Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and aroused my anger by all the idols their hands have made, my anger will burn against this place and will not be quenched.’
12022018 Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the Lord, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says concerning the words you heard:
12022019 Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before the Lord when you heard what I have spoken against this place and its people—that they would become a curse and be laid waste—and because you tore your robes and wept in my presence, I also have heard you, declares the Lord.
12022020 Therefore I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place.’ ” So they took her answer back to the king.
12023001 Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
12023002 He went up to the temple of the Lord with the people of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests and the prophets—all the people from the least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant, which had been found in the temple of the Lord.
12023003 The king stood by the pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the Lord—to follow the Lord and keep his commands, statutes and decrees with all his heart and all his soul, thus confirming the words of the covenant written in this book. Then all the people pledged themselves to the covenant.
12023004 The king ordered Hilkiah the high priest, the priests next in rank and the doorkeepers to remove from the temple of the Lord all the articles made for Baal and Asherah and all the starry hosts. He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron Valley and took the ashes to Bethel.
12023005 He did away with the idolatrous priests appointed by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places of the towns of Judah and on those around Jerusalem—those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and moon, to the constellations and to all the starry hosts.
12023006 He took the Asherah pole from the temple of the Lord to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem and burned it there. He ground it to powder and scattered the dust over the graves of the common people.
12023007 He also tore down the quarters of the male shrine prostitutes that were in the temple of the Lord, the quarters where women did weaving for Asherah.
12023008 Josiah brought all the priests from the towns of Judah and desecrated the high places, from Geba to Beersheba, where the priests had burned incense. He broke down the gateway at the entrance of the Gate of Joshua, the city governor, which was on the left of the city gate.
12023009 Although the priests of the high places did not serve at the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem, they ate unleavened bread with their fellow priests.
12023010 He desecrated Topheth, which was in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, so no one could use it to sacrifice their son or daughter in the fire to Molek.
12023011 He removed from the entrance to the temple of the Lord the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun. They were in the court near the room of an official named Nathan-Melek. Josiah then burned the chariots dedicated to the sun.
12023012 He pulled down the altars the kings of Judah had erected on the roof near the upper room of Ahaz, and the altars Manasseh had built in the two courts of the temple of the Lord. He removed them from there, smashed them to pieces and threw the rubble into the Kidron Valley.
12023013 The king also desecrated the high places that were east of Jerusalem on the south of the Hill of Corruption—the ones Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the vile goddess of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the vile god of Moab, and for Molek the detestable god of the people of Ammon.
12023014 Josiah smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles and covered the sites with human bones.
12023015 Even the altar at Bethel, the high place made by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin—even that altar and high place he demolished. He burned the high place and ground it to powder, and burned the Asherah pole also.
12023016 Then Josiah looked around, and when he saw the tombs that were there on the hillside, he had the bones removed from them and burned on the altar to defile it, in accordance with the word of the Lord proclaimed by the man of God who foretold these things.
12023017 The king asked, “What is that tombstone I see?” The people of the city said, “It marks the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and pronounced against the altar of Bethel the very things you have done to it.”
12023018 “Leave it alone,” he said. “Don’t let anyone disturb his bones.” So they spared his bones and those of the prophet who had come from Samaria.
12023019 Just as he had done at Bethel, Josiah removed all the shrines at the high places that the kings of Israel had built in the towns of Samaria and that had aroused the Lord’s anger.
12023020 Josiah slaughtered all the priests of those high places on the altars and burned human bones on them. Then he went back to Jerusalem.
12023021 The king gave this order to all the people: “Celebrate the Passover to the Lord your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant.”
12023022 Neither in the days of the judges who led Israel nor in the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah had any such Passover been observed.
12023023 But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was celebrated to the Lord in Jerusalem.
12023024 Furthermore, Josiah got rid of the mediums and spiritists, the household gods, the idols and all the other detestable things seen in Judah and Jerusalem. This he did to fulfill the requirements of the law written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had discovered in the temple of the Lord.
12023025 Neither before nor after Josiah was there a king like him who turned to the Lord as he did—with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength, in accordance with all the Law of Moses.
12023026 Nevertheless, the Lord did not turn away from the heat of his fierce anger, which burned against Judah because of all that Manasseh had done to arouse his anger.
12023027 So the Lord said, “I will remove Judah also from my presence as I removed Israel, and I will reject Jerusalem, the city I chose, and this temple, about which I said, ‘My Name shall be there.’ ”
12023028 As for the other events of Josiah’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
12023029 While Josiah was king, Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt went up to the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria. King Josiah marched out to meet him in battle, but Necho faced him and killed him at Megiddo.
12023030 Josiah’s servants brought his body in a chariot from Megiddo to Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and anointed him and made him king in place of his father.
12023031 Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.
12023032 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, just as his predecessors had done.
12023033 Pharaoh Necho put him in chains at Riblah in the land of Hamath so that he might not reign in Jerusalem, and he imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
12023034 Pharaoh Necho made Eliakim son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah and changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz and carried him off to Egypt, and there he died.
12023035 Jehoiakim paid Pharaoh Necho the silver and gold he demanded. In order to do so, he taxed the land and exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land according to their assessments.
12023036 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother’s name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah; she was from Rumah.
12023037 And he did evil in the eyes of the Lord, just as his predecessors had done.
12024001 During Jehoiakim’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded the land, and Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years. But then he turned against Nebuchadnezzar and rebelled.
12024002 The Lord sent Babylonian, Aramean, Moabite and Ammonite raiders against him to destroy Judah, in accordance with the word of the Lord proclaimed by his servants the prophets.
12024003 Surely these things happened to Judah according to the Lord’s command, in order to remove them from his presence because of the sins of Manasseh and all he had done,
12024004 including the shedding of innocent blood. For he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the Lord was not willing to forgive.
12024005 As for the other events of Jehoiakim’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
12024006 Jehoiakim rested with his ancestors. And Jehoiachin his son succeeded him as king.
12024007 The king of Egypt did not march out from his own country again, because the king of Babylon had taken all his territory, from the Wadi of Egypt to the Euphrates River.
12024008 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother’s name was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan; she was from Jerusalem.
12024009 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, just as his father had done.
12024010 At that time the officers of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon advanced on Jerusalem and laid siege to it,
12024011 and Nebuchadnezzar himself came up to the city while his officers were besieging it.
12024012 Jehoiachin king of Judah, his mother, his attendants, his nobles and his officials all surrendered to him. In the eighth year of the reign of the king of Babylon, he took Jehoiachin prisoner.
12024013 As the Lord had declared, Nebuchadnezzar removed the treasures from the temple of the Lord and from the royal palace, and cut up the gold articles that Solomon king of Israel had made for the temple of the Lord.
12024014 He carried all Jerusalem into exile: all the officers and fighting men, and all the skilled workers and artisans—a total of ten thousand. Only the poorest people of the land were left.
12024015 Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin captive to Babylon. He also took from Jerusalem to Babylon the king’s mother, his wives, his officials and the prominent people of the land.
12024016 The king of Babylon also deported to Babylon the entire force of seven thousand fighting men, strong and fit for war, and a thousand skilled workers and artisans.
12024017 He made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, king in his place and changed his name to Zedekiah.
12024018 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.
12024019 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, just as Jehoiakim had done.
12024020 It was because of the Lord’s anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah, and in the end he thrust them from his presence. Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
12025001 So in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. He encamped outside the city and built siege works all around it.
12025002 The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
12025003 By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city had become so severe that there was no food for the people to eat.
12025004 Then the city wall was broken through, and the whole army fled at night through the gate between the two walls near the king’s garden, though the Babylonians were surrounding the city. They fled toward the Arabah,
12025005 but the Babylonian army pursued the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his soldiers were separated from him and scattered,
12025006 and he was captured. He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah, where sentence was pronounced on him.
12025007 They killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. Then they put out his eyes, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon.
12025008 On the seventh day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard, an official of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.
12025009 He set fire to the temple of the Lord, the royal palace and all the houses of Jerusalem. Every important building he burned down.
12025010 The whole Babylonian army under the commander of the imperial guard broke down the walls around Jerusalem.
12025011 Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard carried into exile the people who remained in the city, along with the rest of the populace and those who had deserted to the king of Babylon.
12025012 But the commander left behind some of the poorest people of the land to work the vineyards and fields.
12025013 The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the movable stands and the bronze Sea that were at the temple of the Lord and they carried the bronze to Babylon.
12025014 They also took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, dishes and all the bronze articles used in the temple service.
12025015 The commander of the imperial guard took away the censers and sprinkling bowls—all that were made of pure gold or silver.
12025016 The bronze from the two pillars, the Sea and the movable stands, which Solomon had made for the temple of the Lord, was more than could be weighed.
12025017 Each pillar was eighteen cubits high. The bronze capital on top of one pillar was three cubits high and was decorated with a network and pomegranates of bronze all around. The other pillar, with its network, was similar.
12025018 The commander of the guard took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank and the three doorkeepers.
12025019 Of those still in the city, he took the officer in charge of the fighting men, and five royal advisers. He also took the secretary who was chief officer in charge of conscripting the people of the land and sixty of the conscripts who were found in the city.
12025020 Nebuzaradan the commander took them all and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
12025021 There at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king had them executed. So Judah went into captivity, away from her land.
12025022 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to be over the people he had left behind in Judah.
12025023 When all the army officers and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, Jaazaniah the son of the Maakathite, and their men.
12025024 Gedaliah took an oath to reassure them and their men. “Do not be afraid of the Babylonian officials,” he said. “Settle down in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you.”
12025025 In the seventh month, however, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was of royal blood, came with ten men and assassinated Gedaliah and also the men of Judah and the Babylonians who were with him at Mizpah.
12025026 At this, all the people from the least to the greatest, together with the army officers, fled to Egypt for fear of the Babylonians.
12025027 In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the year Awel-Marduk became king of Babylon, he released Jehoiachin king of Judah from prison. He did this on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month.
12025028 He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.
12025029 So Jehoiachin put aside his prison clothes and for the rest of his life ate regularly at the king’s table.
12025030 Day by day the king gave Jehoiachin a regular allowance as long as he lived.

13004025 Shallum was Shaul’s son, Mibsam his son and Mishma his son.
13004026 The descendants of Mishma: Hammuel his son, Zakkur his son and Shimei his son.
13004027 Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters, but his brothers did not have many children; so their entire clan did not become as numerous as the people of Judah.
13004028 They lived in Beersheba, Moladah, Hazar Shual,
13004029 Bilhah, Ezem, Tolad,
13004030 Bethuel, Hormah, Ziklag,
13004031 Beth Markaboth, Hazar Susim, Beth Biri and Shaaraim. These were their towns until the reign of David.
13004032 Their surrounding villages were Etam, Ain, Rimmon, Token and Ashan—five towns—
13004033 and all the villages around these towns as far as Baalath. These were their settlements. And they kept a genealogical record.
13004034 Meshobab, Jamlech, Joshah son of Amaziah,
13004035 Joel, Jehu son of Joshibiah, the son of Seraiah, the son of Asiel,

13004038 The men listed above by name were leaders of their clans. Their families increased greatly,
13004039 and they went to the outskirts of Gedor to the east of the valley in search of pasture for their flocks.
13004040 They found rich, good pasture, and the land was spacious, peaceful and quiet. Some Hamites had lived there formerly.
13004041 The men whose names were listed came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah. They attacked the Hamites in their dwellings and also the Meunites who were there and completely destroyed them, as is evident to this day. Then they settled in their place, because there was pasture for their flocks.
13004042 And five hundred of these Simeonites, led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi, invaded the hill country of Seir.
13004043 They killed the remaining Amalekites who had escaped, and they have lived there to this day.
13005001 The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel (he was the firstborn, but when he defiled his father’s marriage bed, his rights as firstborn were given to the sons of Joseph son of Israel; so he could not be listed in the genealogical record in accordance with his birthright,
13005002 and though Judah was the strongest of his brothers and a ruler came from him, the rights of the firstborn belonged to Joseph)—
13005003 the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanok, Pallu, Hezron and Karmi.
13005004 The descendants of Joel: Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son,
13005005 Micah his son, Reaiah his son, Baal his son,
13005006 and Beerah his son, whom Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria took into exile. Beerah was a leader of the Reubenites.
13005007 Their relatives by clans, listed according to their genealogical records: Jeiel the chief, Zechariah,
13005008 and Bela son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel. They settled in the area from Aroer to Nebo and Baal Meon.
13005009 To the east they occupied the land up to the edge of the desert that extends to the Euphrates River, because their livestock had increased in Gilead.
13005010 During Saul’s reign they waged war against the Hagrites, who were defeated at their hands; they occupied the dwellings of the Hagrites throughout the entire region east of Gilead.
13005011 The Gadites lived next to them in Bashan, as far as Salekah:
13005012 Joel was the chief, Shapham the second, then Janai and Shaphat, in Bashan.
13005013 Their relatives, by families, were: Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jakan, Zia and Eber—seven in all.
13005014 These were the sons of Abihail son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz.
13005015 Ahi son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, was head of their family.
13005016 The Gadites lived in Gilead, in Bashan and its outlying villages, and on all the pasturelands of Sharon as far as they extended.
13005017 All these were entered in the genealogical records during the reigns of Jotham king of Judah and Jeroboam king of Israel.
13005018 The Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh had 44,760 men ready for military service—able-bodied men who could handle shield and sword, who could use a bow, and who were trained for battle.
13005019 They waged war against the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish and Nodab.
13005020 They were helped in fighting them, and God delivered the Hagrites and all their allies into their hands, because they cried out to him during the battle. He answered their prayers, because they trusted in him.
13005021 They seized the livestock of the Hagrites—fifty thousand camels, two hundred fifty thousand sheep and two thousand donkeys. They also took one hundred thousand people captive,
13005022 and many others fell slain, because the battle was God’s. And they occupied the land until the exile.
13005023 The people of the half-tribe of Manasseh were numerous; they settled in the land from Bashan to Baal Hermon, that is, to Senir (Mount Hermon).
13005024 These were the heads of their families: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah and Jahdiel. They were brave warriors, famous men, and heads of their families.
13005025 But they were unfaithful to the God of their ancestors and prostituted themselves to the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had destroyed before them.
13005026 So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria (that is, Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria), who took the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh into exile. He took them to Halah, Habor, Hara and the river of Gozan, where they are to this day.

13006031 These are the men David put in charge of the music in the house of the Lord after the ark came to rest there.
13006032 They ministered with music before the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, until Solomon built the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem. They performed their duties according to the regulations laid down for them.

13006048 Their fellow Levites were assigned to all the other duties of the tabernacle, the house of God.
13006049 But Aaron and his descendants were the ones who presented offerings on the altar of burnt offering and on the altar of incense in connection with all that was done in the Most Holy Place, making atonement for Israel, in accordance with all that Moses the servant of God had commanded.
13006050 These were the descendants of Aaron: Eleazar his son, Phinehas his son, Abishua his son,

13006052 Meraioth his son, Amariah his son, Ahitub his son,
13006053 Zadok his son and Ahimaaz his son.
13006054 These were the locations of their settlements allotted as their territory (they were assigned to the descendants of Aaron who were from the Kohathite clan, because the first lot was for them):
13006055 They were given Hebron in Judah with its surrounding pasturelands.
13006056 But the fields and villages around the city were given to Caleb son of Jephunneh.
13006057 So the descendants of Aaron were given Hebron (a city of refuge), and Libnah, Jattir, Eshtemoa,
13006058 Hilen, Debir,
13006059 Ashan, Juttah and Beth Shemesh, together with their pasturelands.
13006060 And from the tribe of Benjamin they were given Gibeon, Geba, Alemeth and Anathoth, together with their pasturelands. The total number of towns distributed among the Kohathite clans came to thirteen.

13006063 The descendants of Merari, clan by clan, were allotted twelve towns from the tribes of Reuben, Gad and Zebulun.

13008001 Benjamin was the father of Bela his firstborn, Ashbel the second son, Aharah the third,

13008006 These were the descendants of Ehud, who were heads of families of those living in Geba and were deported to Manahath:

13008008 Sons were born to Shaharaim in Moab after he had divorced his wives Hushim and Baara.

13008011 By Hushim he had Abitub and Elpaal.
13008012 The sons of Elpaal: Eber, Misham, Shemed (who built Ono and Lod with its surrounding villages),

13008028 All these were heads of families, chiefs as listed in their genealogy, and they lived in Jerusalem.
13008029 Jeiel the father of Gibeon lived in Gibeon. His wife’s name was Maakah,
13008030 and his firstborn son was Abdon, followed by Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab,
13008031 Gedor, Ahio, Zeker
13008032 and Mikloth, who was the father of Shimeah. They too lived near their relatives in Jerusalem.

13008039 The sons of his brother Eshek: Ulam his firstborn, Jeush the second son and Eliphelet the third.
13008040 The sons of Ulam were brave warriors who could handle the bow. They had many sons and grandsons—150 in all. All these were the descendants of Benjamin.
13009001 All Israel was listed in the genealogies recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. They were taken captive to Babylon because of their unfaithfulness.
13009002 Now the first to resettle on their own property in their own towns were some Israelites, priests, Levites and temple servants.
13009003 Those from Judah, from Benjamin, and from Ephraim and Manasseh who lived in Jerusalem were:
13009004 Uthai son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, a descendant of Perez son of Judah.
13009005 Of the Shelanites : Asaiah the firstborn and his sons.
13009006 Of the Zerahites: Jeuel. The people from Judah numbered 690.
13009007 Of the Benjamites: Sallu son of Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hassenuah;
13009008 Ibneiah son of Jeroham; Elah son of Uzzi, the son of Mikri; and Meshullam son of Shephatiah, the son of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah.
13009009 The people from Benjamin, as listed in their genealogy, numbered 956. All these men were heads of their families.
13009010 Of the priests: Jedaiah; Jehoiarib; Jakin;
13009011 Azariah son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the official in charge of the house of God;
13009012 Adaiah son of Jeroham, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malkijah; and Maasai son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer.
13009013 The priests, who were heads of families, numbered 1,760. They were able men, responsible for ministering in the house of God.
13009014 Of the Levites: Shemaiah son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, a Merarite;
13009015 Bakbakkar, Heresh, Galal and Mattaniah son of Mika, the son of Zikri, the son of Asaph;
13009016 Obadiah son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun; and Berekiah son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, who lived in the villages of the Netophathites.
13009017 The gatekeepers: Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman and their fellow Levites, Shallum their chief
13009018 being stationed at the King’s Gate on the east, up to the present time. These were the gatekeepers belonging to the camp of the Levites.
13009019 Shallum son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his fellow gatekeepers from his family (the Korahites) were responsible for guarding the thresholds of the tent just as their ancestors had been responsible for guarding the entrance to the dwelling of the Lord.
13009020 In earlier times Phinehas son of Eleazar was the official in charge of the gatekeepers, and the Lord was with him.
13009021 Zechariah son of Meshelemiah was the gatekeeper at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
13009022 Altogether, those chosen to be gatekeepers at the thresholds numbered 212. They were registered by genealogy in their villages. The gatekeepers had been assigned to their positions of trust by David and Samuel the seer.
13009023 They and their descendants were in charge of guarding the gates of the house of the Lord—the house called the tent of meeting.
13009024 The gatekeepers were on the four sides: east, west, north and south.
13009025 Their fellow Levites in their villages had to come from time to time and share their duties for seven-day periods.
13009026 But the four principal gatekeepers, who were Levites, were entrusted with the responsibility for the rooms and treasuries in the house of God.
13009027 They would spend the night stationed around the house of God, because they had to guard it; and they had charge of the key for opening it each morning.
13009028 Some of them were in charge of the articles used in the temple service; they counted them when they were brought in and when they were taken out.
13009029 Others were assigned to take care of the furnishings and all the other articles of the sanctuary, as well as the special flour and wine, and the olive oil, incense and spices.
13009030 But some of the priests took care of mixing the spices.
13009031 A Levite named Mattithiah, the firstborn son of Shallum the Korahite, was entrusted with the responsibility for baking the offering bread.
13009032 Some of the Kohathites, their fellow Levites, were in charge of preparing for every Sabbath the bread set out on the table.
13009033 Those who were musicians, heads of Levite families, stayed in the rooms of the temple and were exempt from other duties because they were responsible for the work day and night.
13009034 All these were heads of Levite families, chiefs as listed in their genealogy, and they lived in Jerusalem.
13009035 Jeiel the father of Gibeon lived in Gibeon. His wife’s name was Maakah,
13009036 and his firstborn son was Abdon, followed by Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab,
13009037 Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah and Mikloth.
13009038 Mikloth was the father of Shimeam. They too lived near their relatives in Jerusalem.
13009039 Ner was the father of Kish, Kish the father of Saul, and Saul the father of Jonathan, Malki-Shua, Abinadab and Esh-Baal.
13009040 The son of Jonathan: Merib-Baal, who was the father of Micah.
13009041 The sons of Micah: Pithon, Melek, Tahrea and Ahaz.
13009042 Ahaz was the father of Jadah, Jadah was the father of Alemeth, Azmaveth and Zimri, and Zimri was the father of Moza.
13009043 Moza was the father of Binea; Rephaiah was his son, Eleasah his son and Azel his son.
13009044 Azel had six sons, and these were their names: Azrikam, Bokeru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah and Hanan. These were the sons of Azel.
13010001 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; the Israelites fled before them, and many fell dead on Mount Gilboa.
13010002 The Philistines were in hot pursuit of Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua.
13010003 The fighting grew fierce around Saul, and when the archers overtook him, they wounded him.
13010004 Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and run me through, or these uncircumcised fellows will come and abuse me.” But his armor-bearer was terrified and would not do it; so Saul took his own sword and fell on it.
13010005 When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his sword and died.
13010006 So Saul and his three sons died, and all his house died together.
13010007 When all the Israelites in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their towns and fled. And the Philistines came and occupied them.
13010008 The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
13010009 They stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news among their idols and their people.
13010010 They put his armor in the temple of their gods and hung up his head in the temple of Dagon.
13010011 When all the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
13010012 all their valiant men went and took the bodies of Saul and his sons and brought them to Jabesh. Then they buried their bones under the great tree in Jabesh, and they fasted seven days.
13010013 Saul died because he was unfaithful to the Lord; he did not keep the word of the Lord and even consulted a medium for guidance,
13010014 and did not inquire of the Lord. So the Lord put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.
13011001 All Israel came together to David at Hebron and said, “We are your own flesh and blood.
13011002 In the past, even while Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the Lord your God said to you, ‘You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.’ ”
13011003 When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, he made a covenant with them at Hebron before the Lord, and they anointed David king over Israel, as the Lord had promised through Samuel.
13011004 David and all the Israelites marched to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). The Jebusites who lived there
13011005 said to David, “You will not get in here.” Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion—which is the City of David.
13011006 David had said, “Whoever leads the attack on the Jebusites will become commander-in-chief.” Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, and so he received the command.
13011007 David then took up residence in the fortress, and so it was called the City of David.
13011008 He built up the city around it, from the terraces to the surrounding wall, while Joab restored the rest of the city.
13011009 And David became more and more powerful, because the Lord Almighty was with him.
13011010 These were the chiefs of David’s mighty warriors—they, together with all Israel, gave his kingship strong support to extend it over the whole land, as the Lord had promised—
13011011 this is the list of David’s mighty warriors: Jashobeam, a Hakmonite, was chief of the officers ; he raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter.
13011012 Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite, one of the three mighty warriors.
13011013 He was with David at Pas Dammim when the Philistines gathered there for battle. At a place where there was a field full of barley, the troops fled from the Philistines.
13011014 But they took their stand in the middle of the field. They defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the Lord brought about a great victory.
13011015 Three of the thirty chiefs came down to David to the rock at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
13011016 At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.
13011017 David longed for water and said, “Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!”
13011018 So the Three broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out to the Lord.
13011019 “God forbid that I should do this!” he said. “Should I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives?” Because they risked their lives to bring it back, David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty warriors.
13011020 Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of the Three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three.
13011021 He was doubly honored above the Three and became their commander, even though he was not included among them.
13011022 Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, performed great exploits. He struck down Moab’s two mightiest warriors. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.
13011023 And he struck down an Egyptian who was five cubits tall. Although the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver’s rod in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear.
13011024 Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty warriors.
13011025 He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
13011026 The mighty warriors were: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem,
13011027 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
13011028 Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa, Abiezer from Anathoth,
13011029 Sibbekai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,
13011030 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite,
13011031 Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah in Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,
13011032 Hurai from the ravines of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,
13011033 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,
13011034 the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan son of Shagee the Hararite,
13011035 Ahiam son of Sakar the Hararite, Eliphal son of Ur,
13011036 Hepher the Mekerathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,
13011037 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai son of Ezbai,
13011038 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar son of Hagri,
13011039 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah,
13011040 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
13011041 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad son of Ahlai,
13011042 Adina son of Shiza the Reubenite, who was chief of the Reubenites, and the thirty with him,
13011043 Hanan son of Maakah, Joshaphat the Mithnite,
13011044 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,
13011045 Jediael son of Shimri, his brother Joha the Tizite,
13011046 Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam, Ithmah the Moabite,
13011047 Eliel, Obed and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
13012001 These were the men who came to David at Ziklag, while he was banished from the presence of Saul son of Kish (they were among the warriors who helped him in battle;
13012002 they were armed with bows and were able to shoot arrows or to sling stones right-handed or left-handed; they were relatives of Saul from the tribe of Benjamin):
13012003 Ahiezer their chief and Joash the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth; Berakah, Jehu the Anathothite,
13012004 and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty warrior among the Thirty, who was a leader of the Thirty; Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad the Gederathite,
13012005 Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah and Shephatiah the Haruphite;
13012006 Elkanah, Ishiah, Azarel, Joezer and Jashobeam the Korahites;
13012007 and Joelah and Zebadiah the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.
13012008 Some Gadites defected to David at his stronghold in the wilderness. They were brave warriors, ready for battle and able to handle the shield and spear. Their faces were the faces of lions, and they were as swift as gazelles in the mountains.
13012009 Ezer was the chief, Obadiah the second in command, Eliab the third,
13012010 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
13012011 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
13012012 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
13012013 Jeremiah the tenth and Makbannai the eleventh.
13012014 These Gadites were army commanders; the least was a match for a hundred, and the greatest for a thousand.
13012015 It was they who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks, and they put to flight everyone living in the valleys, to the east and to the west.
13012016 Other Benjamites and some men from Judah also came to David in his stronghold.
13012017 David went out to meet them and said to them, “If you have come to me in peace to help me, I am ready for you to join me. But if you have come to betray me to my enemies when my hands are free from violence, may the God of our ancestors see it and judge you.”
13012018 Then the Spirit came on Amasai, chief of the Thirty, and he said: “We are yours, David! We are with you, son of Jesse! Success, success to you, and success to those who help you, for your God will help you.” So David received them and made them leaders of his raiding bands.
13012019 Some of the tribe of Manasseh defected to David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. (He and his men did not help the Philistines because, after consultation, their rulers sent him away. They said, “It will cost us our heads if he deserts to his master Saul.”)
13012020 When David went to Ziklag, these were the men of Manasseh who defected to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu and Zillethai, leaders of units of a thousand in Manasseh.
13012021 They helped David against raiding bands, for all of them were brave warriors, and they were commanders in his army.
13012022 Day after day men came to help David, until he had a great army, like the army of God.
13012023 These are the numbers of the men armed for battle who came to David at Hebron to turn Saul’s kingdom over to him, as the Lord had said:
13012024 from Judah, carrying shield and spear—6,800 armed for battle;
13012025 from Simeon, warriors ready for battle—7,100;
13012026 from Levi—4,600,
13012027 including Jehoiada, leader of the family of Aaron, with 3,700 men,
13012028 and Zadok, a brave young warrior, with 22 officers from his family;
13012029 from Benjamin, Saul’s tribe—3,000, most of whom had remained loyal to Saul’s house until then;
13012030 from Ephraim, brave warriors, famous in their own clans—20,800;
13012031 from half the tribe of Manasseh, designated by name to come and make David king—18,000;
13012032 from Issachar, men who understood the times and knew what Israel should do—200 chiefs, with all their relatives under their command;
13012033 from Zebulun, experienced soldiers prepared for battle with every type of weapon, to help David with undivided loyalty—50,000;
13012034 from Naphtali—1,000 officers, together with 37,000 men carrying shields and spears;
13012035 from Dan, ready for battle—28,600;
13012036 from Asher, experienced soldiers prepared for battle—40,000;
13012037 and from east of the Jordan, from Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, armed with every type of weapon—120,000.
13012038 All these were fighting men who volunteered to serve in the ranks. They came to Hebron fully determined to make David king over all Israel. All the rest of the Israelites were also of one mind to make David king.
13012039 The men spent three days there with David, eating and drinking, for their families had supplied provisions for them.
13012040 Also, their neighbors from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun and Naphtali came bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules and oxen. There were plentiful supplies of flour, fig cakes, raisin cakes, wine, olive oil, cattle and sheep, for there was joy in Israel.
13013001 David conferred with each of his officers, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.
13013002 He then said to the whole assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you and if it is the will of the Lord our God, let us send word far and wide to the rest of our people throughout the territories of Israel, and also to the priests and Levites who are with them in their towns and pasturelands, to come and join us.
13013003 Let us bring the ark of our God back to us, for we did not inquire of it during the reign of Saul.”
13013004 The whole assembly agreed to do this, because it seemed right to all the people.
13013005 So David assembled all Israel, from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim.
13013006 David and all Israel went to Baalah of Judah (Kiriath Jearim) to bring up from there the ark of God the Lord, who is enthroned between the cherubim—the ark that is called by the Name.
13013007 They moved the ark of God from Abinadab’s house on a new cart, with Uzzah and Ahio guiding it.
13013008 David and all the Israelites were celebrating with all their might before God, with songs and with harps, lyres, timbrels, cymbals and trumpets.
13013009 When they came to the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the ark, because the oxen stumbled.
13013010 The Lord’s anger burned against Uzzah, and he struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark. So he died there before God.
13013011 Then David was angry because the Lord’s wrath had broken out against Uzzah, and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah.
13013012 David was afraid of God that day and asked, “How can I ever bring the ark of God to me?”
13013013 He did not take the ark to be with him in the City of David. Instead, he took it to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
13013014 The ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house for three months, and the Lord blessed his household and everything he had.
13014001 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs, stonemasons and carpenters to build a palace for him.
13014002 And David knew that the Lord had established him as king over Israel and that his kingdom had been highly exalted for the sake of his people Israel.
13014003 In Jerusalem David took more wives and became the father of more sons and daughters.
13014004 These are the names of the children born to him there: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,

13014008 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they went up in full force to search for him, but David heard about it and went out to meet them.
13014009 Now the Philistines had come and raided the Valley of Rephaim;
13014010 so David inquired of God: “Shall I go and attack the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hands?” The Lord answered him, “Go, I will deliver them into your hands.”
13014011 So David and his men went up to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He said, “As waters break out, God has broken out against my enemies by my hand.” So that place was called Baal Perazim.
13014012 The Philistines had abandoned their gods there, and David gave orders to burn them in the fire.
13014013 Once more the Philistines raided the valley;
13014014 so David inquired of God again, and God answered him, “Do not go directly after them, but circle around them and attack them in front of the poplar trees.
13014015 As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the poplar trees, move out to battle, because that will mean God has gone out in front of you to strike the Philistine army.”
13014016 So David did as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army, all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.
13014017 So David’s fame spread throughout every land, and the Lord made all the nations fear him.
13015001 After David had constructed buildings for himself in the City of David, he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.
13015002 Then David said, “No one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, because the Lord chose them to carry the ark of the Lord and to minister before him forever.”
13015003 David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the Lord to the place he had prepared for it.
13015004 He called together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:
13015005 From the descendants of Kohath, Uriel the leader and 120 relatives;
13015006 from the descendants of Merari, Asaiah the leader and 220 relatives;
13015007 from the descendants of Gershon, Joel the leader and 130 relatives;
13015008 from the descendants of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the leader and 200 relatives;
13015009 from the descendants of Hebron, Eliel the leader and 80 relatives;
13015010 from the descendants of Uzziel, Amminadab the leader and 112 relatives.
13015011 Then David summoned Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel and Amminadab the Levites.
13015012 He said to them, “You are the heads of the Levitical families; you and your fellow Levites are to consecrate yourselves and bring up the ark of the Lord, the God of Israel, to the place I have prepared for it.
13015013 It was because you, the Levites, did not bring it up the first time that the Lord our God broke out in anger against us. We did not inquire of him about how to do it in the prescribed way.”
13015014 So the priests and Levites consecrated themselves in order to bring up the ark of the Lord, the God of Israel.
13015015 And the Levites carried the ark of God with the poles on their shoulders, as Moses had commanded in accordance with the word of the Lord.
13015016 David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their fellow Levites as musicians to make a joyful sound with musical instruments: lyres, harps and cymbals.
13015017 So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; from his relatives, Asaph son of Berekiah; and from their relatives the Merarites, Ethan son of Kushaiah;
13015018 and with them their relatives next in rank: Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom and Jeiel, the gatekeepers.
13015019 The musicians Heman, Asaph and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals;
13015020 Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah and Benaiah were to play the lyres according to alamoth,
13015021 and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel and Azaziah were to play the harps, directing according to sheminith.
13015022 Kenaniah the head Levite was in charge of the singing; that was his responsibility because he was skillful at it.
13015023 Berekiah and Elkanah were to be doorkeepers for the ark.
13015024 Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah and Eliezer the priests were to blow trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-Edom and Jehiah were also to be doorkeepers for the ark.
13015025 So David and the elders of Israel and the commanders of units of a thousand went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the house of Obed-Edom, with rejoicing.
13015026 Because God had helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord, seven bulls and seven rams were sacrificed.
13015027 Now David was clothed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and as were the musicians, and Kenaniah, who was in charge of the singing of the choirs. David also wore a linen ephod.
13015028 So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouts, with the sounding of rams’ horns and trumpets, and of cymbals, and the playing of lyres and harps.
13015029 As the ark of the covenant of the Lord was entering the City of David, Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. And when she saw King David dancing and celebrating, she despised him in her heart.
13016001 They brought the ark of God and set it inside the tent that David had pitched for it, and they presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before God.
13016002 After David had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord.
13016003 Then he gave a loaf of bread, a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each Israelite man and woman.
13016004 He appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of the Lord, to extol, thank, and praise the Lord, the God of Israel:
13016005 Asaph was the chief, and next to him in rank were Zechariah, then Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom and Jeiel. They were to play the lyres and harps, Asaph was to sound the cymbals,
13016006 and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were to blow the trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God.
13016007 That day David first appointed Asaph and his associates to give praise to the Lord in this manner:
13016008 Give praise to the Lord, proclaim his name; make known among the nations what he has done.
13016009 Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts.
13016010 Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice.
13016011 Look to the Lord and his strength; seek his face always.
13016012 Remember the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced,
13016013 you his servants, the descendants of Israel, his chosen ones, the children of Jacob.
13016014 He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
13016015 He remembers his covenant forever, the promise he made, for a thousand generations,
13016016 the covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac.
13016017 He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:
13016018 “To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit.”
13016019 When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers in it,
13016020 they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.
13016021 He allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake he rebuked kings:
13016022 “Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm.”
13016023 Sing to the Lord, all the earth; proclaim his salvation day after day.
13016024 Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among all peoples.
13016025 For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise; he is to be feared above all gods.
13016026 For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made the heavens.
13016027 Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and joy are in his dwelling place.
13016028 Ascribe to the Lord, all you families of nations, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
13016029 Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name; bring an offering and come before him. Worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness.
13016030 Tremble before him, all the earth! The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved.
13016031 Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth be glad; let them say among the nations, “The Lord reigns!”
13016032 Let the sea resound, and all that is in it; let the fields be jubilant, and everything in them!
13016033 Let the trees of the forest sing, let them sing for joy before the Lord, for he comes to judge the earth.
13016034 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever.
13016035 Cry out, “Save us, God our Savior; gather us and deliver us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name, and glory in your praise.”
13016036 Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Then all the people said “Amen” and “Praise the Lord.”
13016037 David left Asaph and his associates before the ark of the covenant of the Lord to minister there regularly, according to each day’s requirements.
13016038 He also left Obed-Edom and his sixty-eight associates to minister with them. Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun, and also Hosah, were gatekeepers.
13016039 David left Zadok the priest and his fellow priests before the tabernacle of the Lord at the high place in Gibeon
13016040 to present burnt offerings to the Lord on the altar of burnt offering regularly, morning and evening, in accordance with everything written in the Law of the Lord, which he had given Israel.
13016041 With them were Heman and Jeduthun and the rest of those chosen and designated by name to give thanks to the Lord, “for his love endures forever.”
13016042 Heman and Jeduthun were responsible for the sounding of the trumpets and cymbals and for the playing of the other instruments for sacred song. The sons of Jeduthun were stationed at the gate.
13016043 Then all the people left, each for their own home, and David returned home to bless his family.
13017001 After David was settled in his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, “Here I am, living in a house of cedar, while the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under a tent.”
13017002 Nathan replied to David, “Whatever you have in mind, do it, for God is with you.”
13017003 But that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying:
13017004 “Go and tell my servant David, ‘This is what the Lord says: You are not the one to build me a house to dwell in.
13017005 I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt to this day. I have moved from one tent site to another, from one dwelling place to another.
13017006 Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their leaders whom I commanded to shepherd my people, “Why have you not built me a house of cedar?” ’
13017007 “Now then, tell my servant David, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty says: I took you from the pasture, from tending the flock, and appointed you ruler over my people Israel.
13017008 I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name like the names of the greatest men on earth.
13017009 And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning
13017010 and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel. I will also subdue all your enemies. “ ‘I declare to you that the Lord will build a house for you:
13017011 When your days are over and you go to be with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.
13017012 He is the one who will build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever.
13017013 I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will never take my love away from him, as I took it away from your predecessor.
13017014 I will set him over my house and my kingdom forever; his throne will be established forever.’ ”
13017015 Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation.
13017016 Then King David went in and sat before the Lord, and he said: “Who am I, Lord God, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?
13017017 And as if this were not enough in your sight, my God, you have spoken about the future of the house of your servant. You, Lord God, have looked on me as though I were the most exalted of men.
13017018 “What more can David say to you for honoring your servant? For you know your servant,
13017019 Lord. For the sake of your servant and according to your will, you have done this great thing and made known all these great promises.
13017020 “There is no one like you, Lord, and there is no God but you, as we have heard with our own ears.
13017021 And who is like your people Israel—the one nation on earth whose God went out to redeem a people for himself, and to make a name for yourself, and to perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt?
13017022 You made your people Israel your very own forever, and you, Lord, have become their God.
13017023 “And now, Lord, let the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house be established forever. Do as you promised,
13017024 so that it will be established and that your name will be great forever. Then people will say, ‘The Lord Almighty, the God over Israel, is Israel’s God!’ And the house of your servant David will be established before you.
13017025 “You, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him. So your servant has found courage to pray to you.
13017026 You, Lord, are God! You have promised these good things to your servant.
13017027 Now you have been pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever in your sight; for you, Lord, have blessed it, and it will be blessed forever.”
13018001 In the course of time, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and he took Gath and its surrounding villages from the control of the Philistines.
13018002 David also defeated the Moabites, and they became subject to him and brought him tribute.
13018003 Moreover, David defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah, in the vicinity of Hamath, when he went to set up his monument at the Euphrates River.
13018004 David captured a thousand of his chariots, seven thousand charioteers and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He hamstrung all but a hundred of the chariot horses.
13018005 When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand of them.
13018006 He put garrisons in the Aramean kingdom of Damascus, and the Arameans became subject to him and brought him tribute. The Lord gave David victory wherever he went.
13018007 David took the gold shields carried by the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
13018008 From Tebah and Kun, towns that belonged to Hadadezer, David took a great quantity of bronze, which Solomon used to make the bronze Sea, the pillars and various bronze articles.
13018009 When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,
13018010 he sent his son Hadoram to King David to greet him and congratulate him on his victory in battle over Hadadezer, who had been at war with Tou. Hadoram brought all kinds of articles of gold, of silver and of bronze.
13018011 King David dedicated these articles to the Lord, as he had done with the silver and gold he had taken from all these nations: Edom and Moab, the Ammonites and the Philistines, and Amalek.
13018012 Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
13018013 He put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became subject to David. The Lord gave David victory wherever he went.
13018014 David reigned over all Israel, doing what was just and right for all his people.
13018015 Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder;
13018016 Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelek son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha was secretary;
13018017 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief officials at the king’s side.
13019001 In the course of time, Nahash king of the Ammonites died, and his son succeeded him as king.
13019002 David thought, “I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father. When David’s envoys came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites to express sympathy to him,
13019003 the Ammonite commanders said to Hanun, “Do you think David is honoring your father by sending envoys to you to express sympathy? Haven’t his envoys come to you only to explore and spy out the country and overthrow it?”
13019004 So Hanun seized David’s envoys, shaved them, cut off their garments at the buttocks, and sent them away.
13019005 When someone came and told David about the men, he sent messengers to meet them, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, “Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back.”
13019006 When the Ammonites realized that they had become obnoxious to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram Naharaim, Aram Maakah and Zobah.
13019007 They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and charioteers, as well as the king of Maakah with his troops, who came and camped near Medeba, while the Ammonites were mustered from their towns and moved out for battle.
13019008 On hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men.
13019009 The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to their city, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.
13019010 Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him; so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans.
13019011 He put the rest of the men under the command of Abishai his brother, and they were deployed against the Ammonites.
13019012 Joab said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to rescue me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will rescue you.
13019013 Be strong, and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. The Lord will do what is good in his sight.”
13019014 Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans, and they fled before him.
13019015 When the Ammonites realized that the Arameans were fleeing, they too fled before his brother Abishai and went inside the city. So Joab went back to Jerusalem.
13019016 After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they sent messengers and had Arameans brought from beyond the Euphrates River, with Shophak the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them.
13019017 When David was told of this, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan; he advanced against them and formed his battle lines opposite them. David formed his lines to meet the Arameans in battle, and they fought against him.
13019018 But they fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers. He also killed Shophak the commander of their army.
13019019 When the vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been routed by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him. So the Arameans were not willing to help the Ammonites anymore.
13020001 In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war, Joab led out the armed forces. He laid waste the land of the Ammonites and went to Rabbah and besieged it, but David remained in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and left it in ruins.
13020002 David took the crown from the head of their king —its weight was found to be a talent of gold, and it was set with precious stones—and it was placed on David’s head. He took a great quantity of plunder from the city
13020003 and brought out the people who were there, consigning them to labor with saws and with iron picks and axes. David did this to all the Ammonite towns. Then David and his entire army returned to Jerusalem.
13020004 In the course of time, war broke out with the Philistines, at Gezer. At that time Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the Rephaites, and the Philistines were subjugated.
13020005 In another battle with the Philistines, Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, who had a spear with a shaft like a weaver’s rod.
13020006 In still another battle, which took place at Gath, there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He also was descended from Rapha.
13020007 When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him.
13020008 These were descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men.
13021001 Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel.
13021002 So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, “Go and count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan. Then report back to me so that I may know how many there are.”
13021003 But Joab replied, “May the Lord multiply his troops a hundred times over. My lord the king, are they not all my lord’s subjects? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?”
13021004 The king’s word, however, overruled Joab; so Joab left and went throughout Israel and then came back to Jerusalem.
13021005 Joab reported the number of the fighting men to David: In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who could handle a sword, including four hundred and seventy thousand in Judah.
13021006 But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, because the king’s command was repulsive to him.
13021007 This command was also evil in the sight of God; so he punished Israel.
13021008 Then David said to God, “I have sinned greatly by doing this. Now, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing.”
13021009 The Lord said to Gad, David’s seer,
13021010 “Go and tell David, ‘This is what the Lord says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.’ ”
13021011 So Gad went to David and said to him, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Take your choice:
13021012 three years of famine, three months of being swept away before your enemies, with their swords overtaking you, or three days of the sword of the Lord—days of plague in the land, with the angel of the Lord ravaging every part of Israel.’ Now then, decide how I should answer the one who sent me.”
13021013 David said to Gad, “I am in deep distress. Let me fall into the hands of the Lord, for his mercy is very great; but do not let me fall into human hands.”
13021014 So the Lord sent a plague on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead.
13021015 And God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. But as the angel was doing so, the Lord saw it and relented concerning the disaster and said to the angel who was destroying the people, “Enough! Withdraw your hand.” The angel of the Lord was then standing at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
13021016 David looked up and saw the angel of the Lord standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand extended over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown.
13021017 David said to God, “Was it not I who ordered the fighting men to be counted? I, the shepherd, have sinned and done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? Lord my God, let your hand fall on me and my family, but do not let this plague remain on your people.”
13021018 Then the angel of the Lord ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
13021019 So David went up in obedience to the word that Gad had spoken in the name of the Lord.
13021020 While Araunah was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the angel; his four sons who were with him hid themselves.
13021021 Then David approached, and when Araunah looked and saw him, he left the threshing floor and bowed down before David with his face to the ground.
13021022 David said to him, “Let me have the site of your threshing floor so I can build an altar to the Lord, that the plague on the people may be stopped. Sell it to me at the full price.”
13021023 Araunah said to David, “Take it! Let my lord the king do whatever pleases him. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give all this.”
13021024 But King David replied to Araunah, “No, I insist on paying the full price. I will not take for the Lord what is yours, or sacrifice a burnt offering that costs me nothing.”
13021025 So David paid Araunah six hundred shekels of gold for the site.
13021026 David built an altar to the Lord there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He called on the Lord, and the Lord answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.
13021027 Then the Lord spoke to the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.
13021028 At that time, when David saw that the Lord had answered him on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there.
13021029 The tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at Gibeon.
13021030 But David could not go before it to inquire of God, because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the Lord.
13022001 Then David said, “The house of the Lord God is to be here, and also the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”
13022002 So David gave orders to assemble the foreigners residing in Israel, and from among them he appointed stonecutters to prepare dressed stone for building the house of God.
13022003 He provided a large amount of iron to make nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings, and more bronze than could be weighed.
13022004 He also provided more cedar logs than could be counted, for the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought large numbers of them to David.
13022005 David said, “My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the Lord should be of great magnificence and fame and splendor in the sight of all the nations. Therefore I will make preparations for it.” So David made extensive preparations before his death.
13022006 Then he called for his son Solomon and charged him to build a house for the Lord, the God of Israel.
13022007 David said to Solomon: “My son, I had it in my heart to build a house for the Name of the Lord my God.
13022008 But this word of the Lord came to me: ‘You have shed much blood and have fought many wars. You are not to build a house for my Name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.
13022009 But you will have a son who will be a man of peace and rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side. His name will be Solomon, and I will grant Israel peace and quiet during his reign.
13022010 He is the one who will build a house for my Name. He will be my son, and I will be his father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’
13022011 “Now, my son, the Lord be with you, and may you have success and build the house of the Lord your God, as he said you would.
13022012 May the Lord give you discretion and understanding when he puts you in command over Israel, so that you may keep the law of the Lord your God.
13022013 Then you will have success if you are careful to observe the decrees and laws that the Lord gave Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged.
13022014 “I have taken great pains to provide for the temple of the Lord a hundred thousand talents of gold, a million talents of silver, quantities of bronze and iron too great to be weighed, and wood and stone. And you may add to them.
13022015 You have many workers: stonecutters, masons and carpenters, as well as those skilled in every kind of work
13022016 in gold and silver, bronze and iron—craftsmen beyond number. Now begin the work, and the Lord be with you.”
13022017 Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon.
13022018 He said to them, “Is not the Lord your God with you? And has he not granted you rest on every side? For he has given the inhabitants of the land into my hands, and the land is subject to the Lord and to his people.
13022019 Now devote your heart and soul to seeking the Lord your God. Begin to build the sanctuary of the Lord God, so that you may bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord and the sacred articles belonging to God into the temple that will be built for the Name of the Lord.”
13023001 When David was old and full of years, he made his son Solomon king over Israel.
13023002 He also gathered together all the leaders of Israel, as well as the priests and Levites.
13023003 The Levites thirty years old or more were counted, and the total number of men was thirty-eight thousand.
13023004 David said, “Of these, twenty-four thousand are to be in charge of the work of the temple of the Lord and six thousand are to be officials and judges.
13023005 Four thousand are to be gatekeepers and four thousand are to praise the Lord with the musical instruments I have provided for that purpose.”
13023006 David separated the Levites into divisions corresponding to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari.
13023007 Belonging to the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.
13023008 The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the first, Zetham and Joel—three in all.
13023009 The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel and Haran—three in all. These were the heads of the families of Ladan.
13023010 And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Ziza, Jeush and Beriah. These were the sons of Shimei—four in all.
13023011 Jahath was the first and Ziza the second, but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons; so they were counted as one family with one assignment.
13023012 The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel—four in all.
13023013 The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart, he and his descendants forever, to consecrate the most holy things, to offer sacrifices before the Lord, to minister before him and to pronounce blessings in his name forever.
13023014 The sons of Moses the man of God were counted as part of the tribe of Levi.
13023015 The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.
13023016 The descendants of Gershom: Shubael was the first.
13023017 The descendants of Eliezer: Rehabiah was the first. Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.
13023018 The sons of Izhar: Shelomith was the first.
13023019 The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth.
13023020 The sons of Uzziel: Micah the first and Ishiah the second.
13023021 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
13023022 Eleazar died without having sons: he had only daughters. Their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them.
13023023 The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth—three in all.
13023024 These were the descendants of Levi by their families—the heads of families as they were registered under their names and counted individually, that is, the workers twenty years old or more who served in the temple of the Lord.
13023025 For David had said, “Since the Lord, the God of Israel, has granted rest to his people and has come to dwell in Jerusalem forever,
13023026 the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the articles used in its service.”
13023027 According to the last instructions of David, the Levites were counted from those twenty years old or more.
13023028 The duty of the Levites was to help Aaron’s descendants in the service of the temple of the Lord: to be in charge of the courtyards, the side rooms, the purification of all sacred things and the performance of other duties at the house of God.
13023029 They were in charge of the bread set out on the table, the special flour for the grain offerings, the thin loaves made without yeast, the baking and the mixing, and all measurements of quantity and size.
13023030 They were also to stand every morning to thank and praise the Lord. They were to do the same in the evening
13023031 and whenever burnt offerings were presented to the Lord on the Sabbaths, at the New Moon feasts and at the appointed festivals. They were to serve before the Lord regularly in the proper number and in the way prescribed for them.
13023032 And so the Levites carried out their responsibilities for the tent of meeting, for the Holy Place and, under their relatives the descendants of Aaron, for the service of the temple of the Lord.
13024001 These were the divisions of the descendants of Aaron: The sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
13024002 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they had no sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar served as the priests.
13024003 With the help of Zadok a descendant of Eleazar and Ahimelek a descendant of Ithamar, David separated them into divisions for their appointed order of ministering.
13024004 A larger number of leaders were found among Eleazar’s descendants than among Ithamar’s, and they were divided accordingly: sixteen heads of families from Eleazar’s descendants and eight heads of families from Ithamar’s descendants.
13024005 They divided them impartially by casting lots, for there were officials of the sanctuary and officials of God among the descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar.
13024006 The scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded their names in the presence of the king and of the officials: Zadok the priest, Ahimelek son of Abiathar and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites—one family being taken from Eleazar and then one from Ithamar.
13024007 The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
13024008 the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
13024009 the fifth to Malkijah, the sixth to Mijamin,
13024010 the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,
13024011 the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shekaniah,
13024012 the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,
13024013 the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
13024014 the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,
13024015 the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,
13024016 the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,
13024017 the twenty-first to Jakin, the twenty-second to Gamul,
13024018 the twenty-third to Delaiah and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
13024019 This was their appointed order of ministering when they entered the temple of the Lord, according to the regulations prescribed for them by their ancestor Aaron, as the Lord, the God of Israel, had commanded him.
13024020 As for the rest of the descendants of Levi: from the sons of Amram: Shubael; from the sons of Shubael: Jehdeiah.
13024021 As for Rehabiah, from his sons: Ishiah was the first.
13024022 From the Izharites: Shelomoth; from the sons of Shelomoth: Jahath.
13024023 The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth.
13024024 The son of Uzziel: Micah; from the sons of Micah: Shamir.
13024025 The brother of Micah: Ishiah; from the sons of Ishiah: Zechariah.
13024026 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The son of Jaaziah: Beno.
13024027 The sons of Merari: from Jaaziah: Beno, Shoham, Zakkur and Ibri.
13024028 From Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.
13024029 From Kish: the son of Kish: Jerahmeel.
13024030 And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth. These were the Levites, according to their families.
13024031 They also cast lots, just as their relatives the descendants of Aaron did, in the presence of King David and of Zadok, Ahimelek, and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites. The families of the oldest brother were treated the same as those of the youngest.
13025001 David, together with the commanders of the army, set apart some of the sons of Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun for the ministry of prophesying, accompanied by harps, lyres and cymbals. Here is the list of the men who performed this service:
13025002 From the sons of Asaph: Zakkur, Joseph, Nethaniah and Asarelah. The sons of Asaph were under the supervision of Asaph, who prophesied under the king’s supervision.
13025003 As for Jeduthun, from his sons: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah and Mattithiah, six in all, under the supervision of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied, using the harp in thanking and praising the Lord.
13025004 As for Heman, from his sons: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shubael and Jerimoth; Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti and Romamti-Ezer; Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir and Mahazioth.
13025005 (All these were sons of Heman the king’s seer. They were given him through the promises of God to exalt him. God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.)
13025006 All these men were under the supervision of their father for the music of the temple of the Lord, with cymbals, lyres and harps, for the ministry at the house of God. Asaph, Jeduthun and Heman were under the supervision of the king.
13025007 Along with their relatives—all of them trained and skilled in music for the Lord—they numbered 288.
13025008 Young and old alike, teacher as well as student, cast lots for their duties.
13025009 The first lot, which was for Asaph, fell to Joseph, his sons and relatives 12 the second to Gedaliah, him and his relatives and sons 12
13025010 the third to Zakkur, his sons and relatives 12
13025011 the fourth to Izri, his sons and relatives 12
13025012 the fifth to Nethaniah, his sons and relatives 12

13025022 the fifteenth to Jerimoth, his sons and relatives 12
13025023 the sixteenth to Hananiah, his sons and relatives 12
13025024 the seventeenth to Joshbekashah, his sons and relatives 12
13025025 the eighteenth to Hanani, his sons and relatives 12
13025026 the nineteenth to Mallothi, his sons and relatives 12
13025027 the twentieth to Eliathah, his sons and relatives 12
13025028 the twenty-first to Hothir, his sons and relatives 12
13025029 the twenty-second to Giddalti, his sons and relatives 12
13025030 the twenty-third to Mahazioth, his sons and relatives 12
13025031 the twenty-fourth to Romamti-Ezer, his sons and relatives 12.
13026001 The divisions of the gatekeepers: From the Korahites: Meshelemiah son of Kore, one of the sons of Asaph.
13026002 Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,
13026003 Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth and Eliehoenai the seventh.
13026004 Obed-Edom also had sons: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, Sakar the fourth, Nethanel the fifth,
13026005 Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh and Peullethai the eighth. (For God had blessed Obed-Edom.)
13026006 Obed-Edom’s son Shemaiah also had sons, who were leaders in their father’s family because they were very capable men.
13026007 The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, Rephael, Obed and Elzabad; his relatives Elihu and Semakiah were also able men.
13026008 All these were descendants of Obed-Edom; they and their sons and their relatives were capable men with the strength to do the work—descendants of Obed-Edom, 62 in all.
13026009 Meshelemiah had sons and relatives, who were able men—18 in all.
13026010 Hosah the Merarite had sons: Shimri the first (although he was not the firstborn, his father had appointed him the first),
13026011 Hilkiah the second, Tabaliah the third and Zechariah the fourth. The sons and relatives of Hosah were 13 in all.
13026012 These divisions of the gatekeepers, through their leaders, had duties for ministering in the temple of the Lord, just as their relatives had.
13026013 Lots were cast for each gate, according to their families, young and old alike.
13026014 The lot for the East Gate fell to Shelemiah. Then lots were cast for his son Zechariah, a wise counselor, and the lot for the North Gate fell to him.
13026015 The lot for the South Gate fell to Obed-Edom, and the lot for the storehouse fell to his sons.
13026016 The lots for the West Gate and the Shalleketh Gate on the upper road fell to Shuppim and Hosah. Guard was alongside of guard:
13026017 There were six Levites a day on the east, four a day on the north, four a day on the south and two at a time at the storehouse.
13026018 As for the court to the west, there were four at the road and two at the court itself.
13026019 These were the divisions of the gatekeepers who were descendants of Korah and Merari.
13026020 Their fellow Levites were in charge of the treasuries of the house of God and the treasuries for the dedicated things.
13026021 The descendants of Ladan, who were Gershonites through Ladan and who were heads of families belonging to Ladan the Gershonite, were Jehieli,
13026022 the sons of Jehieli, Zetham and his brother Joel. They were in charge of the treasuries of the temple of the Lord.
13026023 From the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites and the Uzzielites:
13026024 Shubael, a descendant of Gershom son of Moses, was the official in charge of the treasuries.
13026025 His relatives through Eliezer: Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah his son, Joram his son, Zikri his son and Shelomith his son.
13026026 Shelomith and his relatives were in charge of all the treasuries for the things dedicated by King David, by the heads of families who were the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and by the other army commanders.
13026027 Some of the plunder taken in battle they dedicated for the repair of the temple of the Lord.
13026028 And everything dedicated by Samuel the seer and by Saul son of Kish, Abner son of Ner and Joab son of Zeruiah, and all the other dedicated things were in the care of Shelomith and his relatives.
13026029 From the Izharites: Kenaniah and his sons were assigned duties away from the temple, as officials and judges over Israel.
13026030 From the Hebronites: Hashabiah and his relatives—seventeen hundred able men—were responsible in Israel west of the Jordan for all the work of the Lord and for the king’s service.
13026031 As for the Hebronites, Jeriah was their chief according to the genealogical records of their families. In the fortieth year of David’s reign a search was made in the records, and capable men among the Hebronites were found at Jazer in Gilead.
13026032 Jeriah had twenty-seven hundred relatives, who were able men and heads of families, and King David put them in charge of the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh for every matter pertaining to God and for the affairs of the king.
13027001 This is the list of the Israelites—heads of families, commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and their officers, who served the king in all that concerned the army divisions that were on duty month by month throughout the year. Each division consisted of 24,000 men.
13027002 In charge of the first division, for the first month, was Jashobeam son of Zabdiel. There were 24,000 men in his division.
13027003 He was a descendant of Perez and chief of all the army officers for the first month.
13027004 In charge of the division for the second month was Dodai the Ahohite; Mikloth was the leader of his division. There were 24,000 men in his division.
13027005 The third army commander, for the third month, was Benaiah son of Jehoiada the priest. He was chief and there were 24,000 men in his division.
13027006 This was the Benaiah who was a mighty warrior among the Thirty and was over the Thirty. His son Ammizabad was in charge of his division.

13027015 The twelfth, for the twelfth month, was Heldai the Netophathite, from the family of Othniel. There were 24,000 men in his division.
13027016 The leaders of the tribes of Israel: over the Reubenites: Eliezer son of Zikri; over the Simeonites: Shephatiah son of Maakah;
13027017 over Levi: Hashabiah son of Kemuel; over Aaron: Zadok;
13027018 over Judah: Elihu, a brother of David; over Issachar: Omri son of Michael;
13027019 over Zebulun: Ishmaiah son of Obadiah; over Naphtali: Jerimoth son of Azriel;
13027020 over the Ephraimites: Hoshea son of Azaziah; over half the tribe of Manasseh: Joel son of Pedaiah;
13027021 over the half-tribe of Manasseh in Gilead: Iddo son of Zechariah; over Benjamin: Jaasiel son of Abner;
13027022 over Dan: Azarel son of Jeroham. These were the leaders of the tribes of Israel.
13027023 David did not take the number of the men twenty years old or less, because the Lord had promised to make Israel as numerous as the stars in the sky.
13027024 Joab son of Zeruiah began to count the men but did not finish. God’s wrath came on Israel on account of this numbering, and the number was not entered in the book of the annals of King David.
13027025 Azmaveth son of Adiel was in charge of the royal storehouses. Jonathan son of Uzziah was in charge of the storehouses in the outlying districts, in the towns, the villages and the watchtowers.
13027026 Ezri son of Kelub was in charge of the workers who farmed the land.
13027027 Shimei the Ramathite was in charge of the vineyards. Zabdi the Shiphmite was in charge of the produce of the vineyards for the wine vats.
13027028 Baal-Hanan the Gederite was in charge of the olive and sycamore-fig trees in the western foothills. Joash was in charge of the supplies of olive oil.
13027029 Shitrai the Sharonite was in charge of the herds grazing in Sharon. Shaphat son of Adlai was in charge of the herds in the valleys.
13027030 Obil the Ishmaelite was in charge of the camels. Jehdeiah the Meronothite was in charge of the donkeys.
13027031 Jaziz the Hagrite was in charge of the flocks. All these were the officials in charge of King David’s property.
13027032 Jonathan, David’s uncle, was a counselor, a man of insight and a scribe. Jehiel son of Hakmoni took care of the king’s sons.
13027033 Ahithophel was the king’s counselor. Hushai the Arkite was the king’s confidant.
13027034 Ahithophel was succeeded by Jehoiada son of Benaiah and by Abiathar. Joab was the commander of the royal army.
13028001 David summoned all the officials of Israel to assemble at Jerusalem: the officers over the tribes, the commanders of the divisions in the service of the king, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and the officials in charge of all the property and livestock belonging to the king and his sons, together with the palace officials, the warriors and all the brave fighting men.
13028002 King David rose to his feet and said: “Listen to me, my fellow Israelites, my people. I had it in my heart to build a house as a place of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, for the footstool of our God, and I made plans to build it.
13028003 But God said to me, ‘You are not to build a house for my Name, because you are a warrior and have shed blood.’
13028004 “Yet the Lord, the God of Israel, chose me from my whole family to be king over Israel forever. He chose Judah as leader, and from the tribe of Judah he chose my family, and from my father’s sons he was pleased to make me king over all Israel.
13028005 Of all my sons—and the Lord has given me many—he has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel.
13028006 He said to me: ‘Solomon your son is the one who will build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.
13028007 I will establish his kingdom forever if he is unswerving in carrying out my commands and laws, as is being done at this time.’
13028008 “So now I charge you in the sight of all Israel and of the assembly of the Lord, and in the hearing of our God: Be careful to follow all the commands of the Lord your God, that you may possess this good land and pass it on as an inheritance to your descendants forever.
13028009 “And you, my son Solomon, acknowledge the God of your father, and serve him with wholehearted devotion and with a willing mind, for the Lord searches every heart and understands every desire and every thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will reject you forever.
13028010 Consider now, for the Lord has chosen you to build a house as the sanctuary. Be strong and do the work.”
13028011 Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the portico of the temple, its buildings, its storerooms, its upper parts, its inner rooms and the place of atonement.
13028012 He gave him the plans of all that the Spirit had put in his mind for the courts of the temple of the Lord and all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the temple of God and for the treasuries for the dedicated things.
13028013 He gave him instructions for the divisions of the priests and Levites, and for all the work of serving in the temple of the Lord, as well as for all the articles to be used in its service.
13028014 He designated the weight of gold for all the gold articles to be used in various kinds of service, and the weight of silver for all the silver articles to be used in various kinds of service:
13028015 the weight of gold for the gold lampstands and their lamps, with the weight for each lampstand and its lamps; and the weight of silver for each silver lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand;
13028016 the weight of gold for each table for consecrated bread; the weight of silver for the silver tables;
13028017 the weight of pure gold for the forks, sprinkling bowls and pitchers; the weight of gold for each gold dish; the weight of silver for each silver dish;
13028018 and the weight of the refined gold for the altar of incense. He also gave him the plan for the chariot, that is, the cherubim of gold that spread their wings and overshadow the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
13028019 “All this,” David said, “I have in writing as a result of the Lord’s hand on me, and he enabled me to understand all the details of the plan.”
13028020 David also said to Solomon his son, “Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you or forsake you until all the work for the service of the temple of the Lord is finished.
13028021 The divisions of the priests and Levites are ready for all the work on the temple of God, and every willing person skilled in any craft will help you in all the work. The officials and all the people will obey your every command.”
13029001 Then King David said to the whole assembly: “My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is young and inexperienced. The task is great, because this palatial structure is not for man but for the Lord God.
13029002 With all my resources I have provided for the temple of my God—gold for the gold work, silver for the silver, bronze for the bronze, iron for the iron and wood for the wood, as well as onyx for the settings, turquoise, stones of various colors, and all kinds of fine stone and marble—all of these in large quantities.
13029003 Besides, in my devotion to the temple of my God I now give my personal treasures of gold and silver for the temple of my God, over and above everything I have provided for this holy temple:
13029004 three thousand talents of gold (gold of Ophir) and seven thousand talents of refined silver, for the overlaying of the walls of the buildings,
13029005 for the gold work and the silver work, and for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. Now, who is willing to consecrate themselves to the Lord today?”
13029006 Then the leaders of families, the officers of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king’s work gave willingly.
13029007 They gave toward the work on the temple of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze and a hundred thousand talents of iron.
13029008 Anyone who had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the temple of the Lord in the custody of Jehiel the Gershonite.
13029009 The people rejoiced at the willing response of their leaders, for they had given freely and wholeheartedly to the Lord. David the king also rejoiced greatly.
13029010 David praised the Lord in the presence of the whole assembly, saying, “Praise be to you, Lord, the God of our father Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.
13029011 Yours, Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the majesty and the splendor, for everything in heaven and earth is yours. Yours, Lord, is the kingdom; you are exalted as head over all.
13029012 Wealth and honor come from you; you are the ruler of all things. In your hands are strength and power to exalt and give strength to all.
13029013 Now, our God, we give you thanks, and praise your glorious name.
13029014 “But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? Everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your hand.
13029015 We are foreigners and strangers in your sight, as were all our ancestors. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope.
13029016 Lord our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your Holy Name comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you.
13029017 I know, my God, that you test the heart and are pleased with integrity. All these things I have given willingly and with honest intent. And now I have seen with joy how willingly your people who are here have given to you.
13029018 Lord, the God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac and Israel, keep these desires and thoughts in the hearts of your people forever, and keep their hearts loyal to you.
13029019 And give my son Solomon the wholehearted devotion to keep your commands, statutes and decrees and to do everything to build the palatial structure for which I have provided.”
13029020 Then David said to the whole assembly, “Praise the Lord your God.” So they all praised the Lord, the God of their fathers; they bowed down, prostrating themselves before the Lord and the king.
13029021 The next day they made sacrifices to the Lord and presented burnt offerings to him: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams and a thousand male lambs, together with their drink offerings, and other sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
13029022 They ate and drank with great joy in the presence of the Lord that day. Then they acknowledged Solomon son of David as king a second time, anointing him before the Lord to be ruler and Zadok to be priest.
13029023 So Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king in place of his father David. He prospered and all Israel obeyed him.
13029024 All the officers and warriors, as well as all of King David’s sons, pledged their submission to King Solomon.
13029025 The Lord highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel and bestowed on him royal splendor such as no king over Israel ever had before.
13029026 David son of Jesse was king over all Israel.
13029027 He ruled over Israel forty years—seven in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem.
13029028 He died at a good old age, having enjoyed long life, wealth and honor. His son Solomon succeeded him as king.
13029029 As for the events of King David’s reign, from beginning to end, they are written in the records of Samuel the seer, the records of Nathan the prophet and the records of Gad the seer,
13029030 together with the details of his reign and power, and the circumstances that surrounded him and Israel and the kingdoms of all the other lands.
14001001 Solomon son of David established himself firmly over his kingdom, for the Lord his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.
14001002 Then Solomon spoke to all Israel—to the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, to the judges and to all the leaders in Israel, the heads of families—
14001003 and Solomon and the whole assembly went to the high place at Gibeon, for God’s tent of meeting was there, which Moses the Lord’s servant had made in the wilderness.
14001004 Now David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim to the place he had prepared for it, because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.
14001005 But the bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was in Gibeon in front of the tabernacle of the Lord; so Solomon and the assembly inquired of him there.
14001006 Solomon went up to the bronze altar before the Lord in the tent of meeting and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.
14001007 That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask for whatever you want me to give you.”
14001008 Solomon answered God, “You have shown great kindness to David my father and have made me king in his place.
14001009 Now, Lord God, let your promise to my father David be confirmed, for you have made me king over a people who are as numerous as the dust of the earth.
14001010 Give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may lead this people, for who is able to govern this great people of yours?”
14001011 God said to Solomon, “Since this is your heart’s desire and you have not asked for wealth, possessions or honor, nor for the death of your enemies, and since you have not asked for a long life but for wisdom and knowledge to govern my people over whom I have made you king,
14001012 therefore wisdom and knowledge will be given you. And I will also give you wealth, possessions and honor, such as no king who was before you ever had and none after you will have.”
14001013 Then Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high place at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting. And he reigned over Israel.
14001014 Solomon accumulated chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses, which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.
14001015 The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills.
14001016 Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue —the royal merchants purchased them from Kue at the current price.
14001017 They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. They also exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and of the Arameans.
14002001 Solomon gave orders to build a temple for the Name of the Lord and a royal palace for himself.
14002002 He conscripted 70,000 men as carriers and 80,000 as stonecutters in the hills and 3,600 as foremen over them.
14002003 Solomon sent this message to Hiram king of Tyre: “Send me cedar logs as you did for my father David when you sent him cedar to build a palace to live in.
14002004 Now I am about to build a temple for the Name of the Lord my God and to dedicate it to him for burning fragrant incense before him, for setting out the consecrated bread regularly, and for making burnt offerings every morning and evening and on the Sabbaths, at the New Moons and at the appointed festivals of the Lord our God. This is a lasting ordinance for Israel.
14002005 “The temple I am going to build will be great, because our God is greater than all other gods.
14002006 But who is able to build a temple for him, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain him? Who then am I to build a temple for him, except as a place to burn sacrifices before him?
14002007 “Send me, therefore, a man skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, and in purple, crimson and blue yarn, and experienced in the art of engraving, to work in Judah and Jerusalem with my skilled workers, whom my father David provided.
14002008 “Send me also cedar, juniper and algum logs from Lebanon, for I know that your servants are skilled in cutting timber there. My servants will work with yours
14002009 to provide me with plenty of lumber, because the temple I build must be large and magnificent.
14002010 I will give your servants, the woodsmen who cut the timber, twenty thousand cors of ground wheat, twenty thousand cors of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine and twenty thousand baths of olive oil.”
14002011 Hiram king of Tyre replied by letter to Solomon: “Because the Lord loves his people, he has made you their king.”
14002012 And Hiram added: “Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth! He has given King David a wise son, endowed with intelligence and discernment, who will build a temple for the Lord and a palace for himself.
14002013 “I am sending you Huram-Abi, a man of great skill,
14002014 whose mother was from Dan and whose father was from Tyre. He is trained to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, and with purple and blue and crimson yarn and fine linen. He is experienced in all kinds of engraving and can execute any design given to him. He will work with your skilled workers and with those of my lord, David your father.
14002015 “Now let my lord send his servants the wheat and barley and the olive oil and wine he promised,
14002016 and we will cut all the logs from Lebanon that you need and will float them as rafts by sea down to Joppa. You can then take them up to Jerusalem.”
14002017 Solomon took a census of all the foreigners residing in Israel, after the census his father David had taken; and they were found to be 153,600.
14002018 He assigned 70,000 of them to be carriers and 80,000 to be stonecutters in the hills, with 3,600 foremen over them to keep the people working.
14003001 Then Solomon began to build the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the Lord had appeared to his father David. It was on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, the place provided by David.
14003002 He began building on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.
14003003 The foundation Solomon laid for building the temple of God was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide (using the cubit of the old standard).
14003004 The portico at the front of the temple was twenty cubits long across the width of the building and twenty cubits high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold.
14003005 He paneled the main hall with juniper and covered it with fine gold and decorated it with palm tree and chain designs.
14003006 He adorned the temple with precious stones. And the gold he used was gold of Parvaim.
14003007 He overlaid the ceiling beams, doorframes, walls and doors of the temple with gold, and he carved cherubim on the walls.
14003008 He built the Most Holy Place, its length corresponding to the width of the temple—twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide. He overlaid the inside with six hundred talents of fine gold.
14003009 The gold nails weighed fifty shekels. He also overlaid the upper parts with gold.
14003010 For the Most Holy Place he made a pair of sculptured cherubim and overlaid them with gold.
14003011 The total wingspan of the cherubim was twenty cubits. One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long and touched the temple wall, while its other wing, also five cubits long, touched the wing of the other cherub.
14003012 Similarly one wing of the second cherub was five cubits long and touched the other temple wall, and its other wing, also five cubits long, touched the wing of the first cherub.
14003013 The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits. They stood on their feet, facing the main hall.
14003014 He made the curtain of blue, purple and crimson yarn and fine linen, with cherubim worked into it.
14003015 For the front of the temple he made two pillars, which together were thirty-five cubits long, each with a capital five cubits high.
14003016 He made interwoven chains and put them on top of the pillars. He also made a hundred pomegranates and attached them to the chains.
14003017 He erected the pillars in the front of the temple, one to the south and one to the north. The one to the south he named Jakin and the one to the north Boaz.
14004001 He made a bronze altar twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high.
14004002 He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it.
14004003 Below the rim, figures of bulls encircled it—ten to a cubit. The bulls were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea.
14004004 The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center.
14004005 It was a handbreadth in thickness, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held three thousand baths.
14004006 He then made ten basins for washing and placed five on the south side and five on the north. In them the things to be used for the burnt offerings were rinsed, but the Sea was to be used by the priests for washing.
14004007 He made ten gold lampstands according to the specifications for them and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north.
14004008 He made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. He also made a hundred gold sprinkling bowls.
14004009 He made the courtyard of the priests, and the large court and the doors for the court, and overlaid the doors with bronze.
14004010 He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner.
14004011 And Huram also made the pots and shovels and sprinkling bowls. So Huram finished the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the temple of God:
14004012 the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; the two sets of network decorating the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;
14004013 the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network, decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars);
14004014 the stands with their basins;
14004015 the Sea and the twelve bulls under it;
14004016 the pots, shovels, meat forks and all related articles. All the objects that Huram-Abi made for King Solomon for the temple of the Lord were of polished bronze.
14004017 The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Sukkoth and Zarethan.
14004018 All these things that Solomon made amounted to so much that the weight of the bronze could not be calculated.
14004019 Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in God’s temple: the golden altar; the tables on which was the bread of the Presence;
14004020 the lampstands of pure gold with their lamps, to burn in front of the inner sanctuary as prescribed;
14004021 the gold floral work and lamps and tongs (they were solid gold);
14004022 the pure gold wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers; and the gold doors of the temple: the inner doors to the Most Holy Place and the doors of the main hall.
14005001 When all the work Solomon had done for the temple of the Lord was finished, he brought in the things his father David had dedicated—the silver and gold and all the furnishings—and he placed them in the treasuries of God’s temple.
14005002 Then Solomon summoned to Jerusalem the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite families, to bring up the ark of the Lord’s covenant from Zion, the City of David.
14005003 And all the Israelites came together to the king at the time of the festival in the seventh month.
14005004 When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the Levites took up the ark,
14005005 and they brought up the ark and the tent of meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. The Levitical priests carried them up;
14005006 and King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted.
14005007 The priests then brought the ark of the Lord’s covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim.
14005008 The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and covered the ark and its carrying poles.
14005009 These poles were so long that their ends, extending from the ark, could be seen from in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are still there today.
14005010 There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt.
14005011 The priests then withdrew from the Holy Place. All the priests who were there had consecrated themselves, regardless of their divisions.
14005012 All the Levites who were musicians—Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun and their sons and relatives—stood on the east side of the altar, dressed in fine linen and playing cymbals, harps and lyres. They were accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets.
14005013 The trumpeters and musicians joined in unison to give praise and thanks to the Lord. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals and other instruments, the singers raised their voices in praise to the Lord and sang: “He is good; his love endures forever.” Then the temple of the Lord was filled with the cloud,
14005014 and the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord filled the temple of God.
14006001 Then Solomon said, “The Lord has said that he would dwell in a dark cloud;
14006002 I have built a magnificent temple for you, a place for you to dwell forever.”
14006003 While the whole assembly of Israel was standing there, the king turned around and blessed them.
14006004 Then he said: “Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who with his hands has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to my father David. For he said,
14006005 ‘Since the day I brought my people out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built so that my Name might be there, nor have I chosen anyone to be ruler over my people Israel.
14006006 But now I have chosen Jerusalem for my Name to be there, and I have chosen David to rule my people Israel.’
14006007 “My father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of the Lord, the God of Israel.
14006008 But the Lord said to my father David, ‘You did well to have it in your heart to build a temple for my Name.
14006009 Nevertheless, you are not the one to build the temple, but your son, your own flesh and blood—he is the one who will build the temple for my Name.’
14006010 “The Lord has kept the promise he made. I have succeeded David my father and now I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the Lord promised, and I have built the temple for the Name of the Lord, the God of Israel.
14006011 There I have placed the ark, in which is the covenant of the Lord that he made with the people of Israel.”
14006012 Then Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in front of the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands.
14006013 Now he had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, five cubits wide and three cubits high, and had placed it in the center of the outer court. He stood on the platform and then knelt down before the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven.
14006014 He said: “Lord, the God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven or on earth—you who keep your covenant of love with your servants who continue wholeheartedly in your way.
14006015 You have kept your promise to your servant David my father; with your mouth you have promised and with your hand you have fulfilled it—as it is today.
14006016 “Now, Lord, the God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father the promises you made to him when you said, ‘You shall never fail to have a successor to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your descendants are careful in all they do to walk before me according to my law, as you have done.’
14006017 And now, Lord, the God of Israel, let your word that you promised your servant David come true.
14006018 “But will God really dwell on earth with humans? The heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built!
14006019 Yet, Lord my God, give attention to your servant’s prayer and his plea for mercy. Hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is praying in your presence.
14006020 May your eyes be open toward this temple day and night, this place of which you said you would put your Name there. May you hear the prayer your servant prays toward this place.
14006021 Hear the supplications of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven, your dwelling place; and when you hear, forgive.
14006022 “When anyone wrongs their neighbor and is required to take an oath and they come and swear the oath before your altar in this temple,
14006023 then hear from heaven and act. Judge between your servants, condemning the guilty and bringing down on their heads what they have done, and vindicating the innocent by treating them in accordance with their innocence.
14006024 “When your people Israel have been defeated by an enemy because they have sinned against you and when they turn back and give praise to your name, praying and making supplication before you in this temple,
14006025 then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them back to the land you gave to them and their ancestors.
14006026 “When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you, and when they pray toward this place and give praise to your name and turn from their sin because you have afflicted them,
14006027 then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them the right way to live, and send rain on the land you gave your people for an inheritance.
14006028 “When famine or plague comes to the land, or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers, or when enemies besiege them in any of their cities, whatever disaster or disease may come,
14006029 and when a prayer or plea is made by anyone among your people Israel—being aware of their afflictions and pains, and spreading out their hands toward this temple—
14006030 then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Forgive, and deal with everyone according to all they do, since you know their hearts (for you alone know the human heart),
14006031 so that they will fear you and walk in obedience to you all the time they live in the land you gave our ancestors.
14006032 “As for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm—when they come and pray toward this temple,
14006033 then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel, and may know that this house I have built bears your Name.
14006034 “When your people go to war against their enemies, wherever you send them, and when they pray to you toward this city you have chosen and the temple I have built for your Name,
14006035 then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause.
14006036 “When they sin against you—for there is no one who does not sin—and you become angry with them and give them over to the enemy, who takes them captive to a land far away or near;
14006037 and if they have a change of heart in the land where they are held captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their captivity and say, ‘We have sinned, we have done wrong and acted wickedly’;
14006038 and if they turn back to you with all their heart and soul in the land of their captivity where they were taken, and pray toward the land you gave their ancestors, toward the city you have chosen and toward the temple I have built for your Name;
14006039 then from heaven, your dwelling place, hear their prayer and their pleas, and uphold their cause. And forgive your people, who have sinned against you.
14006040 “Now, my God, may your eyes be open and your ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place.
14006041 “Now arise, Lord God, and come to your resting place, you and the ark of your might. May your priests, Lord God, be clothed with salvation, may your faithful people rejoice in your goodness.
14006042 Lord God, do not reject your anointed one. Remember the great love promised to David your servant.”
14007001 When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord filled the temple.
14007002 The priests could not enter the temple of the Lord because the glory of the Lord filled it.
14007003 When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the Lord above the temple, they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and they worshiped and gave thanks to the Lord, saying, “He is good; his love endures forever.”
14007004 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the Lord.
14007005 And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the people dedicated the temple of God.
14007006 The priests took their positions, as did the Levites with the Lord’s musical instruments, which King David had made for praising the Lord and which were used when he gave thanks, saying, “His love endures forever.” Opposite the Levites, the priests blew their trumpets, and all the Israelites were standing.
14007007 Solomon consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the Lord, and there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings, because the bronze altar he had made could not hold the burnt offerings, the grain offerings and the fat portions.
14007008 So Solomon observed the festival at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him—a vast assembly, people from Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt.
14007009 On the eighth day they held an assembly, for they had celebrated the dedication of the altar for seven days and the festival for seven days more.
14007010 On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people to their homes, joyful and glad in heart for the good things the Lord had done for David and Solomon and for his people Israel.
14007011 When Solomon had finished the temple of the Lord and the royal palace, and had succeeded in carrying out all he had in mind to do in the temple of the Lord and in his own palace,
14007012 the Lord appeared to him at night and said: “I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a temple for sacrifices.
14007013 “When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command locusts to devour the land or send a plague among my people,
14007014 if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.
14007015 Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place.
14007016 I have chosen and consecrated this temple so that my Name may be there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.
14007017 “As for you, if you walk before me faithfully as David your father did, and do all I command, and observe my decrees and laws,
14007018 I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with David your father when I said, ‘You shall never fail to have a successor to rule over Israel.’
14007019 “But if you turn away and forsake the decrees and commands I have given you and go off to serve other gods and worship them,
14007020 then I will uproot Israel from my land, which I have given them, and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. I will make it a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples.
14007021 This temple will become a heap of rubble. All who pass by will be appalled and say, ‘Why has the Lord done such a thing to this land and to this temple?’
14007022 People will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken the Lord, the God of their ancestors, who brought them out of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them—that is why he brought all this disaster on them.’ ”
14008001 At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon built the temple of the Lord and his own palace,
14008002 Solomon rebuilt the villages that Hiram had given him, and settled Israelites in them.
14008003 Solomon then went to Hamath Zobah and captured it.
14008004 He also built up Tadmor in the desert and all the store cities he had built in Hamath.
14008005 He rebuilt Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon as fortified cities, with walls and with gates and bars,
14008006 as well as Baalath and all his store cities, and all the cities for his chariots and for his horses —whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon and throughout all the territory he ruled.
14008007 There were still people left from the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites (these people were not Israelites).
14008008 Solomon conscripted the descendants of all these people remaining in the land—whom the Israelites had not destroyed—to serve as slave labor, as it is to this day.
14008009 But Solomon did not make slaves of the Israelites for his work; they were his fighting men, commanders of his captains, and commanders of his chariots and charioteers.
14008010 They were also King Solomon’s chief officials—two hundred and fifty officials supervising the men.
14008011 Solomon brought Pharaoh’s daughter up from the City of David to the palace he had built for her, for he said, “My wife must not live in the palace of David king of Israel, because the places the ark of the Lord has entered are holy.”
14008012 On the altar of the Lord that he had built in front of the portico, Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings to the Lord,
14008013 according to the daily requirement for offerings commanded by Moses for the Sabbaths, the New Moons and the three annual festivals—the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks and the Festival of Tabernacles.
14008014 In keeping with the ordinance of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their duties, and the Levites to lead the praise and to assist the priests according to each day’s requirement. He also appointed the gatekeepers by divisions for the various gates, because this was what David the man of God had ordered.
14008015 They did not deviate from the king’s commands to the priests or to the Levites in any matter, including that of the treasuries.
14008016 All Solomon’s work was carried out, from the day the foundation of the temple of the Lord was laid until its completion. So the temple of the Lord was finished.
14008017 Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and Elath on the coast of Edom.
14008018 And Hiram sent him ships commanded by his own men, sailors who knew the sea. These, with Solomon’s men, sailed to Ophir and brought back four hundred and fifty talents of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.
14009001 When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon’s fame, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. Arriving with a very great caravan—with camels carrying spices, large quantities of gold, and precious stones—she came to Solomon and talked with him about all she had on her mind.
14009002 Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too hard for him to explain to her.
14009003 When the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, as well as the palace he had built,
14009004 the food on his table, the seating of his officials, the attending servants in their robes, the cupbearers in their robes and the burnt offerings he made at the temple of the Lord, she was overwhelmed.
14009005 She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true.
14009006 But I did not believe what they said until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half the greatness of your wisdom was told me; you have far exceeded the report I heard.
14009007 How happy your people must be! How happy your officials, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!
14009008 Praise be to the Lord your God, who has delighted in you and placed you on his throne as king to rule for the Lord your God. Because of the love of your God for Israel and his desire to uphold them forever, he has made you king over them, to maintain justice and righteousness.”
14009009 Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, large quantities of spices, and precious stones. There had never been such spices as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
14009010 (The servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon brought gold from Ophir; they also brought algumwood and precious stones.
14009011 The king used the algumwood to make steps for the temple of the Lord and for the royal palace, and to make harps and lyres for the musicians. Nothing like them had ever been seen in Judah.)
14009012 King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for; he gave her more than she had brought to him. Then she left and returned with her retinue to her own country.
14009013 The weight of the gold that Solomon received yearly was 666 talents,
14009014 not including the revenues brought in by merchants and traders. Also all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the territories brought gold and silver to Solomon.
14009015 King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of hammered gold went into each shield.
14009016 He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold, with three hundred shekels of gold in each shield. The king put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon.
14009017 Then the king made a great throne covered with ivory and overlaid with pure gold.
14009018 The throne had six steps, and a footstool of gold was attached to it. On both sides of the seat were armrests, with a lion standing beside each of them.
14009019 Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like it had ever been made for any other kingdom.
14009020 All King Solomon’s goblets were gold, and all the household articles in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Nothing was made of silver, because silver was considered of little value in Solomon’s day.
14009021 The king had a fleet of trading ships manned by Hiram’s servants. Once every three years it returned, carrying gold, silver and ivory, and apes and baboons.
14009022 King Solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth.
14009023 All the kings of the earth sought audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had put in his heart.
14009024 Year after year, everyone who came brought a gift—articles of silver and gold, and robes, weapons and spices, and horses and mules.
14009025 Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horses, which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.
14009026 He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt.
14009027 The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills.
14009028 Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from all other countries.
14009029 As for the other events of Solomon’s reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the records of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat?
14009030 Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
14009031 Then he rested with his ancestors and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son succeeded him as king.
14010001 Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone there to make him king.
14010002 When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this (he was in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), he returned from Egypt.
14010003 So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and all Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him:
14010004 “Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.”
14010005 Rehoboam answered, “Come back to me in three days.” So the people went away.
14010006 Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. “How would you advise me to answer these people?” he asked.
14010007 They replied, “If you will be kind to these people and please them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants.”
14010008 But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him.
14010009 He asked them, “What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?”
14010010 The young men who had grown up with him replied, “The people have said to you, ‘Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter.’ Now tell them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist.
14010011 My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.’ ”
14010012 Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, “Come back to me in three days.”
14010013 The king answered them harshly. Rejecting the advice of the elders,
14010014 he followed the advice of the young men and said, “My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.”
14010015 So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from God, to fulfill the word the Lord had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite.
14010016 When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king: “What share do we have in David, what part in Jesse’s son? To your tents, Israel! Look after your own house, David!” So all the Israelites went home.
14010017 But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam still ruled over them.
14010018 King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram, who was in charge of forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam, however, managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.
14010019 So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
14011001 When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mustered Judah and Benjamin—a hundred and eighty thousand able young men—to go to war against Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam.
14011002 But this word of the Lord came to Shemaiah the man of God:
14011003 “Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin,
14011004 ‘This is what the Lord says: Do not go up to fight against your fellow Israelites. Go home, every one of you, for this is my doing.’ ” So they obeyed the words of the Lord and turned back from marching against Jeroboam.
14011005 Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built up towns for defense in Judah:
14011006 Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,
14011007 Beth Zur, Soko, Adullam,
14011008 Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,
14011009 Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,
14011010 Zorah, Aijalon and Hebron. These were fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin.
14011011 He strengthened their defenses and put commanders in them, with supplies of food, olive oil and wine.
14011012 He put shields and spears in all the cities, and made them very strong. So Judah and Benjamin were his.
14011013 The priests and Levites from all their districts throughout Israel sided with him.
14011014 The Levites even abandoned their pasturelands and property and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them as priests of the Lord
14011015 when he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat and calf idols he had made.
14011016 Those from every tribe of Israel who set their hearts on seeking the Lord, the God of Israel, followed the Levites to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to the Lord, the God of their ancestors.
14011017 They strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam son of Solomon three years, following the ways of David and Solomon during this time.
14011018 Rehoboam married Mahalath, who was the daughter of David’s son Jerimoth and of Abihail, the daughter of Jesse’s son Eliab.
14011019 She bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah and Zaham.
14011020 Then he married Maakah daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza and Shelomith.
14011021 Rehoboam loved Maakah daughter of Absalom more than any of his other wives and concubines. In all, he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.
14011022 Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maakah as crown prince among his brothers, in order to make him king.
14011023 He acted wisely, dispersing some of his sons throughout the districts of Judah and Benjamin, and to all the fortified cities. He gave them abundant provisions and took many wives for them.
14012001 After Rehoboam’s position as king was established and he had become strong, he and all Israel with him abandoned the law of the Lord.
14012002 Because they had been unfaithful to the Lord, Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem in the fifth year of King Rehoboam.
14012003 With twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen and the innumerable troops of Libyans, Sukkites and Cushites that came with him from Egypt,
14012004 he captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.
14012005 Then the prophet Shemaiah came to Rehoboam and to the leaders of Judah who had assembled in Jerusalem for fear of Shishak, and he said to them, “This is what the Lord says, ‘You have abandoned me; therefore, I now abandon you to Shishak.’ ”
14012006 The leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “The Lord is just.”
14012007 When the Lord saw that they humbled themselves, this word of the Lord came to Shemaiah: “Since they have humbled themselves, I will not destroy them but will soon give them deliverance. My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem through Shishak.
14012008 They will, however, become subject to him, so that they may learn the difference between serving me and serving the kings of other lands.”
14012009 When Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem, he carried off the treasures of the temple of the Lord and the treasures of the royal palace. He took everything, including the gold shields Solomon had made.
14012010 So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.
14012011 Whenever the king went to the Lord’s temple, the guards went with him, bearing the shields, and afterward they returned them to the guardroom.
14012012 Because Rehoboam humbled himself, the Lord’s anger turned from him, and he was not totally destroyed. Indeed, there was some good in Judah.
14012013 King Rehoboam established himself firmly in Jerusalem and continued as king. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel in which to put his Name. His mother’s name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite.
14012014 He did evil because he had not set his heart on seeking the Lord.
14012015 As for the events of Rehoboam’s reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer that deal with genealogies? There was continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.
14012016 Rehoboam rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. And Abijah his son succeeded him as king.
14013001 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam, Abijah became king of Judah,
14013002 and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother’s name was Maakah, a daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
14013003 Abijah went into battle with an army of four hundred thousand able fighting men, and Jeroboam drew up a battle line against him with eight hundred thousand able troops.
14013004 Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, “Jeroboam and all Israel, listen to me!
14013005 Don’t you know that the Lord, the God of Israel, has given the kingship of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt?
14013006 Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, an official of Solomon son of David, rebelled against his master.
14013007 Some worthless scoundrels gathered around him and opposed Rehoboam son of Solomon when he was young and indecisive and not strong enough to resist them.
14013008 “And now you plan to resist the kingdom of the Lord, which is in the hands of David’s descendants. You are indeed a vast army and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods.
14013009 But didn’t you drive out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and make priests of your own as the peoples of other lands do? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may become a priest of what are not gods.
14013010 “As for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not forsaken him. The priests who serve the Lord are sons of Aaron, and the Levites assist them.
14013011 Every morning and evening they present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the Lord. They set out the bread on the ceremonially clean table and light the lamps on the gold lampstand every evening. We are observing the requirements of the Lord our God. But you have forsaken him.
14013012 God is with us; he is our leader. His priests with their trumpets will sound the battle cry against you. People of Israel, do not fight against the Lord, the God of your ancestors, for you will not succeed.”
14013013 Now Jeroboam had sent troops around to the rear, so that while he was in front of Judah the ambush was behind them.
14013014 Judah turned and saw that they were being attacked at both front and rear. Then they cried out to the Lord. The priests blew their trumpets
14013015 and the men of Judah raised the battle cry. At the sound of their battle cry, God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
14013016 The Israelites fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hands.
14013017 Abijah and his troops inflicted heavy losses on them, so that there were five hundred thousand casualties among Israel’s able men.
14013018 The Israelites were subdued on that occasion, and the people of Judah were victorious because they relied on the Lord, the God of their ancestors.
14013019 Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took from him the towns of Bethel, Jeshanah and Ephron, with their surrounding villages.
14013020 Jeroboam did not regain power during the time of Abijah. And the Lord struck him down and he died.
14013021 But Abijah grew in strength. He married fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
14013022 The other events of Abijah’s reign, what he did and what he said, are written in the annotations of the prophet Iddo.
14014001 And Abijah rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. Asa his son succeeded him as king, and in his days the country was at peace for ten years.
14014002 Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God.
14014003 He removed the foreign altars and the high places, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles.
14014004 He commanded Judah to seek the Lord, the God of their ancestors, and to obey his laws and commands.
14014005 He removed the high places and incense altars in every town in Judah, and the kingdom was at peace under him.
14014006 He built up the fortified cities of Judah, since the land was at peace. No one was at war with him during those years, for the Lord gave him rest.
14014007 “Let us build up these towns,” he said to Judah, “and put walls around them, with towers, gates and bars. The land is still ours, because we have sought the Lord our God; we sought him and he has given us rest on every side.” So they built and prospered.
14014008 Asa had an army of three hundred thousand men from Judah, equipped with large shields and with spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand from Benjamin, armed with small shields and with bows. All these were brave fighting men.
14014009 Zerah the Cushite marched out against them with an army of thousands upon thousands and three hundred chariots, and came as far as Mareshah.
14014010 Asa went out to meet him, and they took up battle positions in the Valley of Zephathah near Mareshah.
14014011 Then Asa called to the Lord his God and said, “Lord, there is no one like you to help the powerless against the mighty. Help us, Lord our God, for we rely on you, and in your name we have come against this vast army. Lord, you are our God; do not let mere mortals prevail against you.”
14014012 The Lord struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah. The Cushites fled,
14014013 and Asa and his army pursued them as far as Gerar. Such a great number of Cushites fell that they could not recover; they were crushed before the Lord and his forces. The men of Judah carried off a large amount of plunder.
14014014 They destroyed all the villages around Gerar, for the terror of the Lord had fallen on them. They looted all these villages, since there was much plunder there.
14014015 They also attacked the camps of the herders and carried off droves of sheep and goats and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
14015001 The Spirit of God came on Azariah son of Oded.
14015002 He went out to meet Asa and said to him, “Listen to me, Asa and all Judah and Benjamin. The Lord is with you when you are with him. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.
14015003 For a long time Israel was without the true God, without a priest to teach and without the law.
14015004 But in their distress they turned to the Lord, the God of Israel, and sought him, and he was found by them.
14015005 In those days it was not safe to travel about, for all the inhabitants of the lands were in great turmoil.
14015006 One nation was being crushed by another and one city by another, because God was troubling them with every kind of distress.
14015007 But as for you, be strong and do not give up, for your work will be rewarded.”
14015008 When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Azariah son of Oded the prophet, he took courage. He removed the detestable idols from the whole land of Judah and Benjamin and from the towns he had captured in the hills of Ephraim. He repaired the altar of the Lord that was in front of the portico of the Lord’s temple.
14015009 Then he assembled all Judah and Benjamin and the people from Ephraim, Manasseh and Simeon who had settled among them, for large numbers had come over to him from Israel when they saw that the Lord his God was with him.
14015010 They assembled at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign.
14015011 At that time they sacrificed to the Lord seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep and goats from the plunder they had brought back.
14015012 They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their ancestors, with all their heart and soul.
14015013 All who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, were to be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman.
14015014 They took an oath to the Lord with loud acclamation, with shouting and with trumpets and horns.
14015015 All Judah rejoiced about the oath because they had sworn it wholeheartedly. They sought God eagerly, and he was found by them. So the Lord gave them rest on every side.
14015016 King Asa also deposed his grandmother Maakah from her position as queen mother, because she had made a repulsive image for the worship of Asherah. Asa cut it down, broke it up and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
14015017 Although he did not remove the high places from Israel, Asa’s heart was fully committed to the Lord all his life.
14015018 He brought into the temple of God the silver and gold and the articles that he and his father had dedicated.
14015019 There was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.
14016001 In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah.
14016002 Asa then took the silver and gold out of the treasuries of the Lord’s temple and of his own palace and sent it to Ben-Hadad king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus.
14016003 “Let there be a treaty between me and you,” he said, “as there was between my father and your father. See, I am sending you silver and gold. Now break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will withdraw from me.”
14016004 Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of Israel. They conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim and all the store cities of Naphtali.
14016005 When Baasha heard this, he stopped building Ramah and abandoned his work.
14016006 Then King Asa brought all the men of Judah, and they carried away from Ramah the stones and timber Baasha had been using. With them he built up Geba and Mizpah.
14016007 At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him: “Because you relied on the king of Aram and not on the Lord your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand.
14016008 Were not the Cushites and Libyans a mighty army with great numbers of chariots and horsemen ? Yet when you relied on the Lord, he delivered them into your hand.
14016009 For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him. You have done a foolish thing, and from now on you will be at war.”
14016010 Asa was angry with the seer because of this; he was so enraged that he put him in prison. At the same time Asa brutally oppressed some of the people.
14016011 The events of Asa’s reign, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
14016012 In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was afflicted with a disease in his feet. Though his disease was severe, even in his illness he did not seek help from the Lord, but only from the physicians.
14016013 Then in the forty-first year of his reign Asa died and rested with his ancestors.
14016014 They buried him in the tomb that he had cut out for himself in the City of David. They laid him on a bier covered with spices and various blended perfumes, and they made a huge fire in his honor.
14017001 Jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king and strengthened himself against Israel.
14017002 He stationed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah and put garrisons in Judah and in the towns of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.
14017003 The Lord was with Jehoshaphat because he followed the ways of his father David before him. He did not consult the Baals
14017004 but sought the God of his father and followed his commands rather than the practices of Israel.
14017005 The Lord established the kingdom under his control; and all Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat, so that he had great wealth and honor.
14017006 His heart was devoted to the ways of the Lord; furthermore, he removed the high places and the Asherah poles from Judah.
14017007 In the third year of his reign he sent his officials Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel and Micaiah to teach in the towns of Judah.
14017008 With them were certain Levites—Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah and Tob-Adonijah—and the priests Elishama and Jehoram.
14017009 They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the Book of the Law of the Lord; they went around to all the towns of Judah and taught the people.
14017010 The fear of the Lord fell on all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding Judah, so that they did not go to war against Jehoshaphat.
14017011 Some Philistines brought Jehoshaphat gifts and silver as tribute, and the Arabs brought him flocks: seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred goats.
14017012 Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful; he built forts and store cities in Judah
14017013 and had large supplies in the towns of Judah. He also kept experienced fighting men in Jerusalem.
14017014 Their enrollment by families was as follows: From Judah, commanders of units of 1,000: Adnah the commander, with 300,000 fighting men;
14017015 next, Jehohanan the commander, with 280,000;
14017016 next, Amasiah son of Zikri, who volunteered himself for the service of the Lord, with 200,000.
14017017 From Benjamin: Eliada, a valiant soldier, with 200,000 men armed with bows and shields;
14017018 next, Jehozabad, with 180,000 men armed for battle.
14017019 These were the men who served the king, besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.
14018001 Now Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honor, and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage.
14018002 Some years later he went down to see Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for him and the people with him and urged him to attack Ramoth Gilead.
14018003 Ahab king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me against Ramoth Gilead?” Jehoshaphat replied, “I am as you are, and my people as your people; we will join you in the war.”
14018004 But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “First seek the counsel of the Lord.”
14018005 So the king of Israel brought together the prophets—four hundred men—and asked them, “Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I not?” “Go,” they answered, “for God will give it into the king’s hand.”
14018006 But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no longer a prophet of the Lord here whom we can inquire of?”
14018007 The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, “There is still one prophet through whom we can inquire of the Lord, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.” “The king should not say such a thing,” Jehoshaphat replied.
14018008 So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.”
14018009 Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.
14018010 Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns, and he declared, “This is what the Lord says: ‘With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.’ ”
14018011 All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. “Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious,” they said, “for the Lord will give it into the king’s hand.”
14018012 The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, “Look, the other prophets without exception are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably.”
14018013 But Micaiah said, “As surely as the Lord lives, I can tell him only what my God says.”
14018014 When he arrived, the king asked him, “Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I not?” “Attack and be victorious,” he answered, “for they will be given into your hand.”
14018015 The king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?”
14018016 Then Micaiah answered, “I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the Lord said, ‘These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.’ ”
14018017 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?”
14018018 Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the multitudes of heaven standing on his right and on his left.
14018019 And the Lord said, ‘Who will entice Ahab king of Israel into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?’ “One suggested this, and another that.
14018020 Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the Lord and said, ‘I will entice him.’ “ ‘By what means?’ the Lord asked.
14018021 “ ‘I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,’ he said. “ ‘You will succeed in enticing him,’ said the Lord. ‘Go and do it.’
14018022 “So now the Lord has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours. The Lord has decreed disaster for you.”
14018023 Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. “Which way did the spirit from the Lord go when he went from me to speak to you?” he asked.
14018024 Micaiah replied, “You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room.”
14018025 The king of Israel then ordered, “Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king’s son,
14018026 and say, ‘This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.’ ”
14018027 Micaiah declared, “If you ever return safely, the Lord has not spoken through me.” Then he added, “Mark my words, all you people!”
14018028 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.
14018029 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
14018030 Now the king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders, “Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.”
14018031 When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, “This is the king of Israel.” So they turned to attack him, but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the Lord helped him. God drew them away from him,
14018032 for when the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they stopped pursuing him.
14018033 But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the breastplate and the scale armor. The king told the chariot driver, “Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I’ve been wounded.”
14018034 All day long the battle raged, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening. Then at sunset he died.
14019001 When Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem,
14019002 Jehu the seer, the son of Hanani, went out to meet him and said to the king, “Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the Lord? Because of this, the wrath of the Lord is on you.
14019003 There is, however, some good in you, for you have rid the land of the Asherah poles and have set your heart on seeking God.”
14019004 Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and turned them back to the Lord, the God of their ancestors.
14019005 He appointed judges in the land, in each of the fortified cities of Judah.
14019006 He told them, “Consider carefully what you do, because you are not judging for mere mortals but for the Lord, who is with you whenever you give a verdict.
14019007 Now let the fear of the Lord be on you. Judge carefully, for with the Lord our God there is no injustice or partiality or bribery.”
14019008 In Jerusalem also, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites, priests and heads of Israelite families to administer the law of the Lord and to settle disputes. And they lived in Jerusalem.
14019009 He gave them these orders: “You must serve faithfully and wholeheartedly in the fear of the Lord.
14019010 In every case that comes before you from your people who live in the cities—whether bloodshed or other concerns of the law, commands, decrees or regulations—you are to warn them not to sin against the Lord; otherwise his wrath will come on you and your people. Do this, and you will not sin.
14019011 “Amariah the chief priest will be over you in any matter concerning the Lord, and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the leader of the tribe of Judah, will be over you in any matter concerning the king, and the Levites will serve as officials before you. Act with courage, and may the Lord be with those who do well.”
14020001 After this, the Moabites and Ammonites with some of the Meunites came to wage war against Jehoshaphat.
14020002 Some people came and told Jehoshaphat, “A vast army is coming against you from Edom, from the other side of the Dead Sea. It is already in Hazezon Tamar” (that is, En Gedi).
14020003 Alarmed, Jehoshaphat resolved to inquire of the Lord, and he proclaimed a fast for all Judah.
14020004 The people of Judah came together to seek help from the Lord; indeed, they came from every town in Judah to seek him.
14020005 Then Jehoshaphat stood up in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem at the temple of the Lord in the front of the new courtyard
14020006 and said: “Lord, the God of our ancestors, are you not the God who is in heaven? You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations. Power and might are in your hand, and no one can withstand you.
14020007 Our God, did you not drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your friend?
14020008 They have lived in it and have built in it a sanctuary for your Name, saying,
14020009 ‘If calamity comes upon us, whether the sword of judgment, or plague or famine, we will stand in your presence before this temple that bears your Name and will cry out to you in our distress, and you will hear us and save us.’
14020010 “But now here are men from Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir, whose territory you would not allow Israel to invade when they came from Egypt; so they turned away from them and did not destroy them.
14020011 See how they are repaying us by coming to drive us out of the possession you gave us as an inheritance.
14020012 Our God, will you not judge them? For we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you.”
14020013 All the men of Judah, with their wives and children and little ones, stood there before the Lord.
14020014 Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Jahaziel son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite and descendant of Asaph, as he stood in the assembly.
14020015 He said: “Listen, King Jehoshaphat and all who live in Judah and Jerusalem! This is what the Lord says to you: ‘Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army. For the battle is not yours, but God’s.
14020016 Tomorrow march down against them. They will be climbing up by the Pass of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the gorge in the Desert of Jeruel.
14020017 You will not have to fight this battle. Take up your positions; stand firm and see the deliverance the Lord will give you, Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Go out to face them tomorrow, and the Lord will be with you.’ ”
14020018 Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground, and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem fell down in worship before the Lord.
14020019 Then some Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up and praised the Lord, the God of Israel, with a very loud voice.
14020020 Early in the morning they left for the Desert of Tekoa. As they set out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, Judah and people of Jerusalem! Have faith in the Lord your God and you will be upheld; have faith in his prophets and you will be successful.”
14020021 After consulting the people, Jehoshaphat appointed men to sing to the Lord and to praise him for the splendor of his holiness as they went out at the head of the army, saying: “Give thanks to the Lord, for his love endures forever.”
14020022 As they began to sing and praise, the Lord set ambushes against the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir who were invading Judah, and they were defeated.
14020023 The Ammonites and Moabites rose up against the men from Mount Seir to destroy and annihilate them. After they finished slaughtering the men from Seir, they helped to destroy one another.
14020024 When the men of Judah came to the place that overlooks the desert and looked toward the vast army, they saw only dead bodies lying on the ground; no one had escaped.
14020025 So Jehoshaphat and his men went to carry off their plunder, and they found among them a great amount of equipment and clothing and also articles of value—more than they could take away. There was so much plunder that it took three days to collect it.
14020026 On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berakah, where they praised the Lord. This is why it is called the Valley of Berakah to this day.
14020027 Then, led by Jehoshaphat, all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned joyfully to Jerusalem, for the Lord had given them cause to rejoice over their enemies.
14020028 They entered Jerusalem and went to the temple of the Lord with harps and lyres and trumpets.
14020029 The fear of God came on all the surrounding kingdoms when they heard how the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel.
14020030 And the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace, for his God had given him rest on every side.
14020031 So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king of Judah, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
14020032 He followed the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them; he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord.
14020033 The high places, however, were not removed, and the people still had not set their hearts on the God of their ancestors.
14020034 The other events of Jehoshaphat’s reign, from beginning to end, are written in the annals of Jehu son of Hanani, which are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel.
14020035 Later, Jehoshaphat king of Judah made an alliance with Ahaziah king of Israel, whose ways were wicked.
14020036 He agreed with him to construct a fleet of trading ships. After these were built at Ezion Geber,
14020037 Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have made an alliance with Ahaziah, the Lord will destroy what you have made.” The ships were wrecked and were not able to set sail to trade.
14021001 Then Jehoshaphat rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. And Jehoram his son succeeded him as king.
14021002 Jehoram’s brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat, were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael and Shephatiah. All these were sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
14021003 Their father had given them many gifts of silver and gold and articles of value, as well as fortified cities in Judah, but he had given the kingdom to Jehoram because he was his firstborn son.
14021004 When Jehoram established himself firmly over his father’s kingdom, he put all his brothers to the sword along with some of the officials of Israel.
14021005 Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.
14021006 He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the Lord.
14021007 Nevertheless, because of the covenant the Lord had made with David, the Lord was not willing to destroy the house of David. He had promised to maintain a lamp for him and his descendants forever.
14021008 In the time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king.
14021009 So Jehoram went there with his officers and all his chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he rose up and broke through by night.
14021010 To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah. Libnah revolted at the same time, because Jehoram had forsaken the Lord, the God of his ancestors.
14021011 He had also built high places on the hills of Judah and had caused the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves and had led Judah astray.
14021012 Jehoram received a letter from Elijah the prophet, which said: “This is what the Lord, the God of your father David, says: ‘You have not followed the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or of Asa king of Judah.
14021013 But you have followed the ways of the kings of Israel, and you have led Judah and the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves, just as the house of Ahab did. You have also murdered your own brothers, members of your own family, men who were better than you.
14021014 So now the Lord is about to strike your people, your sons, your wives and everything that is yours, with a heavy blow.
14021015 You yourself will be very ill with a lingering disease of the bowels, until the disease causes your bowels to come out.’ ”
14021016 The Lord aroused against Jehoram the hostility of the Philistines and of the Arabs who lived near the Cushites.
14021017 They attacked Judah, invaded it and carried off all the goods found in the king’s palace, together with his sons and wives. Not a son was left to him except Ahaziah, the youngest.
14021018 After all this, the Lord afflicted Jehoram with an incurable disease of the bowels.
14021019 In the course of time, at the end of the second year, his bowels came out because of the disease, and he died in great pain. His people made no funeral fire in his honor, as they had for his predecessors.
14021020 Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. He passed away, to no one’s regret, and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
14022001 The people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, Jehoram’s youngest son, king in his place, since the raiders, who came with the Arabs into the camp, had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.
14022002 Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother’s name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri.
14022003 He too followed the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother encouraged him to act wickedly.
14022004 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as the house of Ahab had done, for after his father’s death they became his advisers, to his undoing.
14022005 He also followed their counsel when he went with Joram son of Ahab king of Israel to wage war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram;
14022006 so he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds they had inflicted on him at Ramoth in his battle with Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Joram son of Ahab because he had been wounded.
14022007 Through Ahaziah’s visit to Joram, God brought about Ahaziah’s downfall. When Ahaziah arrived, he went out with Joram to meet Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the Lord had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab.
14022008 While Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the officials of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s relatives, who had been attending Ahaziah, and he killed them.
14022009 He then went in search of Ahaziah, and his men captured him while he was hiding in Samaria. He was brought to Jehu and put to death. They buried him, for they said, “He was a son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the Lord with all his heart.” So there was no one in the house of Ahaziah powerful enough to retain the kingdom.
14022010 When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to destroy the whole royal family of the house of Judah.
14022011 But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram, took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the royal princes who were about to be murdered and put him and his nurse in a bedroom. Because Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram and wife of the priest Jehoiada, was Ahaziah’s sister, she hid the child from Athaliah so she could not kill him.
14022012 He remained hidden with them at the temple of God for six years while Athaliah ruled the land.
14023001 In the seventh year Jehoiada showed his strength. He made a covenant with the commanders of units of a hundred: Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zikri.
14023002 They went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites and the heads of Israelite families from all the towns. When they came to Jerusalem,
14023003 the whole assembly made a covenant with the king at the temple of God. Jehoiada said to them, “The king’s son shall reign, as the Lord promised concerning the descendants of David.
14023004 Now this is what you are to do: A third of you priests and Levites who are going on duty on the Sabbath are to keep watch at the doors,
14023005 a third of you at the royal palace and a third at the Foundation Gate, and all the others are to be in the courtyards of the temple of the Lord.
14023006 No one is to enter the temple of the Lord except the priests and Levites on duty; they may enter because they are consecrated, but all the others are to observe the Lord’s command not to enter.
14023007 The Levites are to station themselves around the king, each with weapon in hand. Anyone who enters the temple is to be put to death. Stay close to the king wherever he goes.”
14023008 The Levites and all the men of Judah did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each one took his men—those who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off duty—for Jehoiada the priest had not released any of the divisions.
14023009 Then he gave the commanders of units of a hundred the spears and the large and small shields that had belonged to King David and that were in the temple of God.
14023010 He stationed all the men, each with his weapon in his hand, around the king—near the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple.
14023011 Jehoiada and his sons brought out the king’s son and put the crown on him; they presented him with a copy of the covenant and proclaimed him king. They anointed him and shouted, “Long live the king!”
14023012 When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and cheering the king, she went to them at the temple of the Lord.
14023013 She looked, and there was the king, standing by his pillar at the entrance. The officers and the trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, and musicians with their instruments were leading the praises. Then Athaliah tore her robes and shouted, “Treason! Treason!”
14023014 Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of units of a hundred, who were in charge of the troops, and said to them: “Bring her out between the ranks and put to the sword anyone who follows her.” For the priest had said, “Do not put her to death at the temple of the Lord.”
14023015 So they seized her as she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate on the palace grounds, and there they put her to death.
14023016 Jehoiada then made a covenant that he, the people and the king would be the Lord’s people.
14023017 All the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.
14023018 Then Jehoiada placed the oversight of the temple of the Lord in the hands of the Levitical priests, to whom David had made assignments in the temple, to present the burnt offerings of the Lord as written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and singing, as David had ordered.
14023019 He also stationed gatekeepers at the gates of the Lord’s temple so that no one who was in any way unclean might enter.
14023020 He took with him the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people and all the people of the land and brought the king down from the temple of the Lord. They went into the palace through the Upper Gate and seated the king on the royal throne.
14023021 All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was calm, because Athaliah had been slain with the sword.
14024001 Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother’s name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba.
14024002 Joash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord all the years of Jehoiada the priest.
14024003 Jehoiada chose two wives for him, and he had sons and daughters.
14024004 Some time later Joash decided to restore the temple of the Lord.
14024005 He called together the priests and Levites and said to them, “Go to the towns of Judah and collect the money due annually from all Israel, to repair the temple of your God. Do it now.” But the Levites did not act at once.
14024006 Therefore the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him, “Why haven’t you required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by Moses the servant of the Lord and by the assembly of Israel for the tent of the covenant law?”
14024007 Now the sons of that wicked woman Athaliah had broken into the temple of God and had used even its sacred objects for the Baals.
14024008 At the king’s command, a chest was made and placed outside, at the gate of the temple of the Lord.
14024009 A proclamation was then issued in Judah and Jerusalem that they should bring to the Lord the tax that Moses the servant of God had required of Israel in the wilderness.
14024010 All the officials and all the people brought their contributions gladly, dropping them into the chest until it was full.
14024011 Whenever the chest was brought in by the Levites to the king’s officials and they saw that there was a large amount of money, the royal secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and carry it back to its place. They did this regularly and collected a great amount of money.
14024012 The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who carried out the work required for the temple of the Lord. They hired masons and carpenters to restore the Lord’s temple, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the temple.
14024013 The men in charge of the work were diligent, and the repairs progressed under them. They rebuilt the temple of God according to its original design and reinforced it.
14024014 When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada, and with it were made articles for the Lord’s temple: articles for the service and for the burnt offerings, and also dishes and other objects of gold and silver. As long as Jehoiada lived, burnt offerings were presented continually in the temple of the Lord.
14024015 Now Jehoiada was old and full of years, and he died at the age of a hundred and thirty.
14024016 He was buried with the kings in the City of David, because of the good he had done in Israel for God and his temple.
14024017 After the death of Jehoiada, the officials of Judah came and paid homage to the king, and he listened to them.
14024018 They abandoned the temple of the Lord, the God of their ancestors, and worshiped Asherah poles and idols. Because of their guilt, God’s anger came on Judah and Jerusalem.
14024019 Although the Lord sent prophets to the people to bring them back to him, and though they testified against them, they would not listen.
14024020 Then the Spirit of God came on Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood before the people and said, “This is what God says: ‘Why do you disobey the Lord’s commands? You will not prosper. Because you have forsaken the Lord, he has forsaken you.’ ”
14024021 But they plotted against him, and by order of the king they stoned him to death in the courtyard of the Lord’s temple.
14024022 King Joash did not remember the kindness Zechariah’s father Jehoiada had shown him but killed his son, who said as he lay dying, “May the Lord see this and call you to account.”
14024023 At the turn of the year, the army of Aram marched against Joash; it invaded Judah and Jerusalem and killed all the leaders of the people. They sent all the plunder to their king in Damascus.
14024024 Although the Aramean army had come with only a few men, the Lord delivered into their hands a much larger army. Because Judah had forsaken the Lord, the God of their ancestors, judgment was executed on Joash.
14024025 When the Arameans withdrew, they left Joash severely wounded. His officials conspired against him for murdering the son of Jehoiada the priest, and they killed him in his bed. So he died and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
14024026 Those who conspired against him were Zabad, son of Shimeath an Ammonite woman, and Jehozabad, son of Shimrith a Moabite woman.
14024027 The account of his sons, the many prophecies about him, and the record of the restoration of the temple of God are written in the annotations on the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son succeeded him as king.
14025001 Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem.
14025002 He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, but not wholeheartedly.
14025003 After the kingdom was firmly in his control, he executed the officials who had murdered his father the king.
14025004 Yet he did not put their children to death, but acted in accordance with what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses, where the Lord commanded: “Parents shall not be put to death for their children, nor children be put to death for their parents; each will die for their own sin.”
14025005 Amaziah called the people of Judah together and assigned them according to their families to commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He then mustered those twenty years old or more and found that there were three hundred thousand men fit for military service, able to handle the spear and shield.
14025006 He also hired a hundred thousand fighting men from Israel for a hundred talents of silver.
14025007 But a man of God came to him and said, “Your Majesty, these troops from Israel must not march with you, for the Lord is not with Israel—not with any of the people of Ephraim.
14025008 Even if you go and fight courageously in battle, God will overthrow you before the enemy, for God has the power to help or to overthrow.”
14025009 Amaziah asked the man of God, “But what about the hundred talents I paid for these Israelite troops?” The man of God replied, “The Lord can give you much more than that.”
14025010 So Amaziah dismissed the troops who had come to him from Ephraim and sent them home. They were furious with Judah and left for home in a great rage.
14025011 Amaziah then marshaled his strength and led his army to the Valley of Salt, where he killed ten thousand men of Seir.
14025012 The army of Judah also captured ten thousand men alive, took them to the top of a cliff and threw them down so that all were dashed to pieces.
14025013 Meanwhile the troops that Amaziah had sent back and had not allowed to take part in the war raided towns belonging to Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon. They killed three thousand people and carried off great quantities of plunder.
14025014 When Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites, he brought back the gods of the people of Seir. He set them up as his own gods, bowed down to them and burned sacrifices to them.
14025015 The anger of the Lord burned against Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him, who said, “Why do you consult this people’s gods, which could not save their own people from your hand?”
14025016 While he was still speaking, the king said to him, “Have we appointed you an adviser to the king? Stop! Why be struck down?” So the prophet stopped but said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.”
14025017 After Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, he sent this challenge to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel: “Come, let us face each other in battle.”
14025018 But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: “A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot.
14025019 You say to yourself that you have defeated Edom, and now you are arrogant and proud. But stay at home! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah also?”
14025020 Amaziah, however, would not listen, for God so worked that he might deliver them into the hands of Jehoash, because they sought the gods of Edom.
14025021 So Jehoash king of Israel attacked. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth Shemesh in Judah.
14025022 Judah was routed by Israel, and every man fled to his home.
14025023 Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh. Then Jehoash brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate—a section about four hundred cubits long.
14025024 He took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the temple of God that had been in the care of Obed-Edom, together with the palace treasures and the hostages, and returned to Samaria.
14025025 Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.
14025026 As for the other events of Amaziah’s reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
14025027 From the time that Amaziah turned away from following the Lord, they conspired against him in Jerusalem and he fled to Lachish, but they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him there.
14025028 He was brought back by horse and was buried with his ancestors in the City of Judah.
14026001 Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
14026002 He was the one who rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah after Amaziah rested with his ancestors.
14026003 Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother’s name was Jekoliah; she was from Jerusalem.
14026004 He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, just as his father Amaziah had done.
14026005 He sought God during the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God. As long as he sought the Lord, God gave him success.
14026006 He went to war against the Philistines and broke down the walls of Gath, Jabneh and Ashdod. He then rebuilt towns near Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines.
14026007 God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabs who lived in Gur Baal and against the Meunites.
14026008 The Ammonites brought tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread as far as the border of Egypt, because he had become very powerful.
14026009 Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate and at the angle of the wall, and he fortified them.
14026010 He also built towers in the wilderness and dug many cisterns, because he had much livestock in the foothills and in the plain. He had people working his fields and vineyards in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil.
14026011 Uzziah had a well-trained army, ready to go out by divisions according to their numbers as mustered by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the officer under the direction of Hananiah, one of the royal officials.
14026012 The total number of family leaders over the fighting men was 2,600.
14026013 Under their command was an army of 307,500 men trained for war, a powerful force to support the king against his enemies.
14026014 Uzziah provided shields, spears, helmets, coats of armor, bows and slingstones for the entire army.
14026015 In Jerusalem he made devices invented for use on the towers and on the corner defenses so that soldiers could shoot arrows and hurl large stones from the walls. His fame spread far and wide, for he was greatly helped until he became powerful.
14026016 But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall. He was unfaithful to the Lord his God, and entered the temple of the Lord to burn incense on the altar of incense.
14026017 Azariah the priest with eighty other courageous priests of the Lord followed him in.
14026018 They confronted King Uzziah and said, “It is not right for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord. That is for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who have been consecrated to burn incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have been unfaithful; and you will not be honored by the Lord God.”
14026019 Uzziah, who had a censer in his hand ready to burn incense, became angry. While he was raging at the priests in their presence before the incense altar in the Lord’s temple, leprosy broke out on his forehead.
14026020 When Azariah the chief priest and all the other priests looked at him, they saw that he had leprosy on his forehead, so they hurried him out. Indeed, he himself was eager to leave, because the Lord had afflicted him.
14026021 King Uzziah had leprosy until the day he died. He lived in a separate house —leprous, and banned from the temple of the Lord. Jotham his son had charge of the palace and governed the people of the land.
14026022 The other events of Uzziah’s reign, from beginning to end, are recorded by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
14026023 Uzziah rested with his ancestors and was buried near them in a cemetery that belonged to the kings, for people said, “He had leprosy.” And Jotham his son succeeded him as king.
14027001 Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. His mother’s name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok.
14027002 He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, just as his father Uzziah had done, but unlike him he did not enter the temple of the Lord. The people, however, continued their corrupt practices.
14027003 Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the temple of the Lord and did extensive work on the wall at the hill of Ophel.
14027004 He built towns in the hill country of Judah and forts and towers in the wooded areas.
14027005 Jotham waged war against the king of the Ammonites and conquered them. That year the Ammonites paid him a hundred talents of silver, ten thousand cors of wheat and ten thousand cors of barley. The Ammonites brought him the same amount also in the second and third years.
14027006 Jotham grew powerful because he walked steadfastly before the Lord his God.
14027007 The other events in Jotham’s reign, including all his wars and the other things he did, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
14027008 He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years.
14027009 Jotham rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. And Ahaz his son succeeded him as king.
14028001 Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. Unlike David his father, he did not do what was right in the eyes of the Lord.
14028002 He followed the ways of the kings of Israel and also made idols for worshiping the Baals.
14028003 He burned sacrifices in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and sacrificed his children in the fire, engaging in the detestable practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites.
14028004 He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places, on the hilltops and under every spreading tree.
14028005 Therefore the Lord his God delivered him into the hands of the king of Aram. The Arameans defeated him and took many of his people as prisoners and brought them to Damascus. He was also given into the hands of the king of Israel, who inflicted heavy casualties on him.
14028006 In one day Pekah son of Remaliah killed a hundred and twenty thousand soldiers in Judah—because Judah had forsaken the Lord, the God of their ancestors.
14028007 Zikri, an Ephraimite warrior, killed Maaseiah the king’s son, Azrikam the officer in charge of the palace, and Elkanah, second to the king.
14028008 The men of Israel took captive from their fellow Israelites who were from Judah two hundred thousand wives, sons and daughters. They also took a great deal of plunder, which they carried back to Samaria.
14028009 But a prophet of the Lord named Oded was there, and he went out to meet the army when it returned to Samaria. He said to them, “Because the Lord, the God of your ancestors, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand. But you have slaughtered them in a rage that reaches to heaven.
14028010 And now you intend to make the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem your slaves. But aren’t you also guilty of sins against the Lord your God?
14028011 Now listen to me! Send back your fellow Israelites you have taken as prisoners, for the Lord’s fierce anger rests on you.”
14028012 Then some of the leaders in Ephraim—Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berekiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai—confronted those who were arriving from the war.
14028013 “You must not bring those prisoners here,” they said, “or we will be guilty before the Lord. Do you intend to add to our sin and guilt? For our guilt is already great, and his fierce anger rests on Israel.”
14028014 So the soldiers gave up the prisoners and plunder in the presence of the officials and all the assembly.
14028015 The men designated by name took the prisoners, and from the plunder they clothed all who were naked. They provided them with clothes and sandals, food and drink, and healing balm. All those who were weak they put on donkeys. So they took them back to their fellow Israelites at Jericho, the City of Palms, and returned to Samaria.
14028016 At that time King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria for help.
14028017 The Edomites had again come and attacked Judah and carried away prisoners,
14028018 while the Philistines had raided towns in the foothills and in the Negev of Judah. They captured and occupied Beth Shemesh, Aijalon and Gederoth, as well as Soko, Timnah and Gimzo, with their surrounding villages.
14028019 The Lord had humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had promoted wickedness in Judah and had been most unfaithful to the Lord.
14028020 Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came to him, but he gave him trouble instead of help.
14028021 Ahaz took some of the things from the temple of the Lord and from the royal palace and from the officials and presented them to the king of Assyria, but that did not help him.
14028022 In his time of trouble King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the Lord.
14028023 He offered sacrifices to the gods of Damascus, who had defeated him; for he thought, “Since the gods of the kings of Aram have helped them, I will sacrifice to them so they will help me.” But they were his downfall and the downfall of all Israel.
14028024 Ahaz gathered together the furnishings from the temple of God and cut them in pieces. He shut the doors of the Lord’s temple and set up altars at every street corner in Jerusalem.
14028025 In every town in Judah he built high places to burn sacrifices to other gods and aroused the anger of the Lord, the God of his ancestors.
14028026 The other events of his reign and all his ways, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
14028027 Ahaz rested with his ancestors and was buried in the city of Jerusalem, but he was not placed in the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son succeeded him as king.
14029001 Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah.
14029002 He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, just as his father David had done.
14029003 In the first month of the first year of his reign, he opened the doors of the temple of the Lord and repaired them.
14029004 He brought in the priests and the Levites, assembled them in the square on the east side
14029005 and said: “Listen to me, Levites! Consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the temple of the Lord, the God of your ancestors. Remove all defilement from the sanctuary.
14029006 Our parents were unfaithful; they did evil in the eyes of the Lord our God and forsook him. They turned their faces away from the Lord’s dwelling place and turned their backs on him.
14029007 They also shut the doors of the portico and put out the lamps. They did not burn incense or present any burnt offerings at the sanctuary to the God of Israel.
14029008 Therefore, the anger of the Lord has fallen on Judah and Jerusalem; he has made them an object of dread and horror and scorn, as you can see with your own eyes.
14029009 This is why our fathers have fallen by the sword and why our sons and daughters and our wives are in captivity.
14029010 Now I intend to make a covenant with the Lord, the God of Israel, so that his fierce anger will turn away from us.
14029011 My sons, do not be negligent now, for the Lord has chosen you to stand before him and serve him, to minister before him and to burn incense.”
14029012 Then these Levites set to work: from the Kohathites, Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah; from the Merarites, Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel; from the Gershonites, Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah;
14029013 from the descendants of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; from the descendants of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;
14029014 from the descendants of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; from the descendants of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
14029015 When they had assembled their fellow Levites and consecrated themselves, they went in to purify the temple of the Lord, as the king had ordered, following the word of the Lord.
14029016 The priests went into the sanctuary of the Lord to purify it. They brought out to the courtyard of the Lord’s temple everything unclean that they found in the temple of the Lord. The Levites took it and carried it out to the Kidron Valley.
14029017 They began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and by the eighth day of the month they reached the portico of the Lord. For eight more days they consecrated the temple of the Lord itself, finishing on the sixteenth day of the first month.
14029018 Then they went in to King Hezekiah and reported: “We have purified the entire temple of the Lord, the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the table for setting out the consecrated bread, with all its articles.
14029019 We have prepared and consecrated all the articles that King Ahaz removed in his unfaithfulness while he was king. They are now in front of the Lord’s altar.”
14029020 Early the next morning King Hezekiah gathered the city officials together and went up to the temple of the Lord.
14029021 They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven male lambs and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary and for Judah. The king commanded the priests, the descendants of Aaron, to offer these on the altar of the Lord.
14029022 So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and splashed it against the altar; next they slaughtered the rams and splashed their blood against the altar; then they slaughtered the lambs and splashed their blood against the altar.
14029023 The goats for the sin offering were brought before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them.
14029024 The priests then slaughtered the goats and presented their blood on the altar for a sin offering to atone for all Israel, because the king had ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.
14029025 He stationed the Levites in the temple of the Lord with cymbals, harps and lyres in the way prescribed by David and Gad the king’s seer and Nathan the prophet; this was commanded by the Lord through his prophets.
14029026 So the Levites stood ready with David’s instruments, and the priests with their trumpets.
14029027 Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar. As the offering began, singing to the Lord began also, accompanied by trumpets and the instruments of David king of Israel.
14029028 The whole assembly bowed in worship, while the musicians played and the trumpets sounded. All this continued until the sacrifice of the burnt offering was completed.
14029029 When the offerings were finished, the king and everyone present with him knelt down and worshiped.
14029030 King Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to praise the Lord with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with gladness and bowed down and worshiped.
14029031 Then Hezekiah said, “You have now dedicated yourselves to the Lord. Come and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the temple of the Lord.” So the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all whose hearts were willing brought burnt offerings.
14029032 The number of burnt offerings the assembly brought was seventy bulls, a hundred rams and two hundred male lambs—all of them for burnt offerings to the Lord.
14029033 The animals consecrated as sacrifices amounted to six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep and goats.
14029034 The priests, however, were too few to skin all the burnt offerings; so their relatives the Levites helped them until the task was finished and until other priests had been consecrated, for the Levites had been more conscientious in consecrating themselves than the priests had been.
14029035 There were burnt offerings in abundance, together with the fat of the fellowship offerings and the drink offerings that accompanied the burnt offerings. So the service of the temple of the Lord was reestablished.
14029036 Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced at what God had brought about for his people, because it was done so quickly.
14030001 Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, inviting them to come to the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the Lord, the God of Israel.
14030002 The king and his officials and the whole assembly in Jerusalem decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month.
14030003 They had not been able to celebrate it at the regular time because not enough priests had consecrated themselves and the people had not assembled in Jerusalem.
14030004 The plan seemed right both to the king and to the whole assembly.
14030005 They decided to send a proclamation throughout Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, calling the people to come to Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the Lord, the God of Israel. It had not been celebrated in large numbers according to what was written.
14030006 At the king’s command, couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with letters from the king and from his officials, which read: “People of Israel, return to the Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, that he may return to you who are left, who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.
14030007 Do not be like your parents and your fellow Israelites, who were unfaithful to the Lord, the God of their ancestors, so that he made them an object of horror, as you see.
14030008 Do not be stiff-necked, as your ancestors were; submit to the Lord. Come to his sanctuary, which he has consecrated forever. Serve the Lord your God, so that his fierce anger will turn away from you.
14030009 If you return to the Lord, then your fellow Israelites and your children will be shown compassion by their captors and will return to this land, for the Lord your God is gracious and compassionate. He will not turn his face from you if you return to him.”
14030010 The couriers went from town to town in Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun, but people scorned and ridiculed them.
14030011 Nevertheless, some from Asher, Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem.
14030012 Also in Judah the hand of God was on the people to give them unity of mind to carry out what the king and his officials had ordered, following the word of the Lord.
14030013 A very large crowd of people assembled in Jerusalem to celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread in the second month.
14030014 They removed the altars in Jerusalem and cleared away the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley.
14030015 They slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed and consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the temple of the Lord.
14030016 Then they took up their regular positions as prescribed in the Law of Moses the man of God. The priests splashed against the altar the blood handed to them by the Levites.
14030017 Since many in the crowd had not consecrated themselves, the Levites had to kill the Passover lambs for all those who were not ceremonially clean and could not consecrate their lambs to the Lord.
14030018 Although most of the many people who came from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover, contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, “May the Lord, who is good, pardon everyone
14030019 who sets their heart on seeking God—the Lord, the God of their ancestors—even if they are not clean according to the rules of the sanctuary.”
14030020 And the Lord heard Hezekiah and healed the people.
14030021 The Israelites who were present in Jerusalem celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great rejoicing, while the Levites and priests praised the Lord every day with resounding instruments dedicated to the Lord.
14030022 Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites, who showed good understanding of the service of the Lord. For the seven days they ate their assigned portion and offered fellowship offerings and praised the Lord, the God of their ancestors.
14030023 The whole assembly then agreed to celebrate the festival seven more days; so for another seven days they celebrated joyfully.
14030024 Hezekiah king of Judah provided a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep and goats for the assembly, and the officials provided them with a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep and goats. A great number of priests consecrated themselves.
14030025 The entire assembly of Judah rejoiced, along with the priests and Levites and all who had assembled from Israel, including the foreigners who had come from Israel and also those who resided in Judah.
14030026 There was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem.
14030027 The priests and the Levites stood to bless the people, and God heard them, for their prayer reached heaven, his holy dwelling place.
14031001 When all this had ended, the Israelites who were there went out to the towns of Judah, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles. They destroyed the high places and the altars throughout Judah and Benjamin and in Ephraim and Manasseh. After they had destroyed all of them, the Israelites returned to their own towns and to their own property.
14031002 Hezekiah assigned the priests and Levites to divisions—each of them according to their duties as priests or Levites—to offer burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, to minister, to give thanks and to sing praises at the gates of the Lord’s dwelling.
14031003 The king contributed from his own possessions for the morning and evening burnt offerings and for the burnt offerings on the Sabbaths, at the New Moons and at the appointed festivals as written in the Law of the Lord.
14031004 He ordered the people living in Jerusalem to give the portion due the priests and Levites so they could devote themselves to the Law of the Lord.
14031005 As soon as the order went out, the Israelites generously gave the firstfruits of their grain, new wine, olive oil and honey and all that the fields produced. They brought a great amount, a tithe of everything.
14031006 The people of Israel and Judah who lived in the towns of Judah also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things dedicated to the Lord their God, and they piled them in heaps.
14031007 They began doing this in the third month and finished in the seventh month.
14031008 When Hezekiah and his officials came and saw the heaps, they praised the Lord and blessed his people Israel.
14031009 Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the heaps;
14031010 and Azariah the chief priest, from the family of Zadok, answered, “Since the people began to bring their contributions to the temple of the Lord, we have had enough to eat and plenty to spare, because the Lord has blessed his people, and this great amount is left over.”
14031011 Hezekiah gave orders to prepare storerooms in the temple of the Lord, and this was done.
14031012 Then they faithfully brought in the contributions, tithes and dedicated gifts. Konaniah, a Levite, was the overseer in charge of these things, and his brother Shimei was next in rank.
14031013 Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath and Benaiah were assistants of Konaniah and Shimei his brother. All these served by appointment of King Hezekiah and Azariah the official in charge of the temple of God.
14031014 Kore son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the East Gate, was in charge of the freewill offerings given to God, distributing the contributions made to the Lord and also the consecrated gifts.
14031015 Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah and Shekaniah assisted him faithfully in the towns of the priests, distributing to their fellow priests according to their divisions, old and young alike.
14031016 In addition, they distributed to the males three years old or more whose names were in the genealogical records—all who would enter the temple of the Lord to perform the daily duties of their various tasks, according to their responsibilities and their divisions.
14031017 And they distributed to the priests enrolled by their families in the genealogical records and likewise to the Levites twenty years old or more, according to their responsibilities and their divisions.
14031018 They included all the little ones, the wives, and the sons and daughters of the whole community listed in these genealogical records. For they were faithful in consecrating themselves.
14031019 As for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who lived on the farm lands around their towns or in any other towns, men were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among them and to all who were recorded in the genealogies of the Levites.
14031020 This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah, doing what was good and right and faithful before the Lord his God.
14031021 In everything that he undertook in the service of God’s temple and in obedience to the law and the commands, he sought his God and worked wholeheartedly. And so he prospered.
14032001 After all that Hezekiah had so faithfully done, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah. He laid siege to the fortified cities, thinking to conquer them for himself.
14032002 When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he intended to wage war against Jerusalem,
14032003 he consulted with his officials and military staff about blocking off the water from the springs outside the city, and they helped him.
14032004 They gathered a large group of people who blocked all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land. “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water?” they said.
14032005 Then he worked hard repairing all the broken sections of the wall and building towers on it. He built another wall outside that one and reinforced the terraces of the City of David. He also made large numbers of weapons and shields.
14032006 He appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate and encouraged them with these words:
14032007 “Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria and the vast army with him, for there is a greater power with us than with him.
14032008 With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles.” And the people gained confidence from what Hezekiah the king of Judah said.
14032009 Later, when Sennacherib king of Assyria and all his forces were laying siege to Lachish, he sent his officers to Jerusalem with this message for Hezekiah king of Judah and for all the people of Judah who were there:
14032010 “This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says: On what are you basing your confidence, that you remain in Jerusalem under siege?
14032011 When Hezekiah says, ‘The Lord our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria,’ he is misleading you, to let you die of hunger and thirst.
14032012 Did not Hezekiah himself remove this god’s high places and altars, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship before one altar and burn sacrifices on it’?
14032013 “Do you not know what I and my predecessors have done to all the peoples of the other lands? Were the gods of those nations ever able to deliver their land from my hand?
14032014 Who of all the gods of these nations that my predecessors destroyed has been able to save his people from me? How then can your god deliver you from my hand?
14032015 Now do not let Hezekiah deceive you and mislead you like this. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my predecessors. How much less will your god deliver you from my hand!”
14032016 Sennacherib’s officers spoke further against the Lord God and against his servant Hezekiah.
14032017 The king also wrote letters ridiculing the Lord, the God of Israel, and saying this against him: “Just as the gods of the peoples of the other lands did not rescue their people from my hand, so the god of Hezekiah will not rescue his people from my hand.”
14032018 Then they called out in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to terrify them and make them afraid in order to capture the city.
14032019 They spoke about the God of Jerusalem as they did about the gods of the other peoples of the world—the work of human hands.
14032020 King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz cried out in prayer to heaven about this.
14032021 And the Lord sent an angel, who annihilated all the fighting men and the commanders and officers in the camp of the Assyrian king. So he withdrew to his own land in disgrace. And when he went into the temple of his god, some of his sons, his own flesh and blood, cut him down with the sword.
14032022 So the Lord saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria and from the hand of all others. He took care of them on every side.
14032023 Many brought offerings to Jerusalem for the Lord and valuable gifts for Hezekiah king of Judah. From then on he was highly regarded by all the nations.
14032024 In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. He prayed to the Lord, who answered him and gave him a miraculous sign.
14032025 But Hezekiah’s heart was proud and he did not respond to the kindness shown him; therefore the Lord’s wrath was on him and on Judah and Jerusalem.
14032026 Then Hezekiah repented of the pride of his heart, as did the people of Jerusalem; therefore the Lord’s wrath did not come on them during the days of Hezekiah.
14032027 Hezekiah had very great wealth and honor, and he made treasuries for his silver and gold and for his precious stones, spices, shields and all kinds of valuables.
14032028 He also made buildings to store the harvest of grain, new wine and olive oil; and he made stalls for various kinds of cattle, and pens for the flocks.
14032029 He built villages and acquired great numbers of flocks and herds, for God had given him very great riches.
14032030 It was Hezekiah who blocked the upper outlet of the Gihon spring and channeled the water down to the west side of the City of David. He succeeded in everything he undertook.
14032031 But when envoys were sent by the rulers of Babylon to ask him about the miraculous sign that had occurred in the land, God left him to test him and to know everything that was in his heart.
14032032 The other events of Hezekiah’s reign and his acts of devotion are written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
14032033 Hezekiah rested with his ancestors and was buried on the hill where the tombs of David’s descendants are. All Judah and the people of Jerusalem honored him when he died. And Manasseh his son succeeded him as king.
14033001 Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years.
14033002 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, following the detestable practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites.
14033003 He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had demolished; he also erected altars to the Baals and made Asherah poles. He bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshiped them.
14033004 He built altars in the temple of the Lord, of which the Lord had said, “My Name will remain in Jerusalem forever.”
14033005 In both courts of the temple of the Lord, he built altars to all the starry hosts.
14033006 He sacrificed his children in the fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, practiced divination and witchcraft, sought omens, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the Lord, arousing his anger.
14033007 He took the image he had made and put it in God’s temple, of which God had said to David and to his son Solomon, “In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my Name forever.
14033008 I will not again make the feet of the Israelites leave the land I assigned to your ancestors, if only they will be careful to do everything I commanded them concerning all the laws, decrees and regulations given through Moses.”
14033009 But Manasseh led Judah and the people of Jerusalem astray, so that they did more evil than the nations the Lord had destroyed before the Israelites.
14033010 The Lord spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention.
14033011 So the Lord brought against them the army commanders of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh prisoner, put a hook in his nose, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon.
14033012 In his distress he sought the favor of the Lord his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his ancestors.
14033013 And when he prayed to him, the Lord was moved by his entreaty and listened to his plea; so he brought him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the Lord is God.
14033014 Afterward he rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David, west of the Gihon spring in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate and encircling the hill of Ophel; he also made it much higher. He stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities in Judah.
14033015 He got rid of the foreign gods and removed the image from the temple of the Lord, as well as all the altars he had built on the temple hill and in Jerusalem; and he threw them out of the city.
14033016 Then he restored the altar of the Lord and sacrificed fellowship offerings and thank offerings on it, and told Judah to serve the Lord, the God of Israel.
14033017 The people, however, continued to sacrifice at the high places, but only to the Lord their God.
14033018 The other events of Manasseh’s reign, including his prayer to his God and the words the seers spoke to him in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, are written in the annals of the kings of Israel.
14033019 His prayer and how God was moved by his entreaty, as well as all his sins and unfaithfulness, and the sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and idols before he humbled himself—all these are written in the records of the seers.
14033020 Manasseh rested with his ancestors and was buried in his palace. And Amon his son succeeded him as king.
14033021 Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years.
14033022 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Manasseh had done. Amon worshiped and offered sacrifices to all the idols Manasseh had made.
14033023 But unlike his father Manasseh, he did not humble himself before the Lord; Amon increased his guilt.
14033024 Amon’s officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace.
14033025 Then the people of the land killed all who had plotted against King Amon, and they made Josiah his son king in his place.
14034001 Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years.
14034002 He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord and followed the ways of his father David, not turning aside to the right or to the left.
14034003 In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek the God of his father David. In his twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of high places, Asherah poles and idols.
14034004 Under his direction the altars of the Baals were torn down; he cut to pieces the incense altars that were above them, and smashed the Asherah poles and the idols. These he broke to pieces and scattered over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.
14034005 He burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and so he purged Judah and Jerusalem.
14034006 In the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim and Simeon, as far as Naphtali, and in the ruins around them,
14034007 he tore down the altars and the Asherah poles and crushed the idols to powder and cut to pieces all the incense altars throughout Israel. Then he went back to Jerusalem.
14034008 In the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign, to purify the land and the temple, he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah and Maaseiah the ruler of the city, with Joah son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the temple of the Lord his God.
14034009 They went to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought into the temple of God, which the Levites who were the gatekeepers had collected from the people of Manasseh, Ephraim and the entire remnant of Israel and from all the people of Judah and Benjamin and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
14034010 Then they entrusted it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the Lord’s temple. These men paid the workers who repaired and restored the temple.
14034011 They also gave money to the carpenters and builders to purchase dressed stone, and timber for joists and beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin.
14034012 The workers labored faithfully. Over them to direct them were Jahath and Obadiah, Levites descended from Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, descended from Kohath. The Levites—all who were skilled in playing musical instruments—
14034013 had charge of the laborers and supervised all the workers from job to job. Some of the Levites were secretaries, scribes and gatekeepers.
14034014 While they were bringing out the money that had been taken into the temple of the Lord, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the Lord that had been given through Moses.
14034015 Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the Lord.” He gave it to Shaphan.
14034016 Then Shaphan took the book to the king and reported to him: “Your officials are doing everything that has been committed to them.
14034017 They have paid out the money that was in the temple of the Lord and have entrusted it to the supervisors and workers.”
14034018 Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.
14034019 When the king heard the words of the Law, he tore his robes.
14034020 He gave these orders to Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah, Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the king’s attendant:
14034021 “Go and inquire of the Lord for me and for the remnant in Israel and Judah about what is written in this book that has been found. Great is the Lord’s anger that is poured out on us because those who have gone before us have not kept the word of the Lord; they have not acted in accordance with all that is written in this book.”
14034022 Hilkiah and those the king had sent with him went to speak to the prophet Huldah, who was the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the New Quarter.
14034023 She said to them, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Tell the man who sent you to me,
14034024 ‘This is what the Lord says: I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people—all the curses written in the book that has been read in the presence of the king of Judah.
14034025 Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and aroused my anger by all that their hands have made, my anger will be poured out on this place and will not be quenched.’
14034026 Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the Lord, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says concerning the words you heard:
14034027 Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before God when you heard what he spoke against this place and its people, and because you humbled yourself before me and tore your robes and wept in my presence, I have heard you, declares the Lord.
14034028 Now I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place and on those who live here.’ ” So they took her answer back to the king.
14034029 Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
14034030 He went up to the temple of the Lord with the people of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests and the Levites—all the people from the least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant, which had been found in the temple of the Lord.
14034031 The king stood by his pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the Lord—to follow the Lord and keep his commands, statutes and decrees with all his heart and all his soul, and to obey the words of the covenant written in this book.
14034032 Then he had everyone in Jerusalem and Benjamin pledge themselves to it; the people of Jerusalem did this in accordance with the covenant of God, the God of their ancestors.
14034033 Josiah removed all the detestable idols from all the territory belonging to the Israelites, and he had all who were present in Israel serve the Lord their God. As long as he lived, they did not fail to follow the Lord, the God of their ancestors.
14035001 Josiah celebrated the Passover to the Lord in Jerusalem, and the Passover lamb was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of the first month.
14035002 He appointed the priests to their duties and encouraged them in the service of the Lord’s temple.
14035003 He said to the Levites, who instructed all Israel and who had been consecrated to the Lord: “Put the sacred ark in the temple that Solomon son of David king of Israel built. It is not to be carried about on your shoulders. Now serve the Lord your God and his people Israel.
14035004 Prepare yourselves by families in your divisions, according to the instructions written by David king of Israel and by his son Solomon.
14035005 “Stand in the holy place with a group of Levites for each subdivision of the families of your fellow Israelites, the lay people.
14035006 Slaughter the Passover lambs, consecrate yourselves and prepare the lambs for your fellow Israelites, doing what the Lord commanded through Moses.”
14035007 Josiah provided for all the lay people who were there a total of thirty thousand lambs and goats for the Passover offerings, and also three thousand cattle—all from the king’s own possessions.
14035008 His officials also contributed voluntarily to the people and the priests and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah and Jehiel, the officials in charge of God’s temple, gave the priests twenty-six hundred Passover offerings and three hundred cattle.
14035009 Also Konaniah along with Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah, Jeiel and Jozabad, the leaders of the Levites, provided five thousand Passover offerings and five hundred head of cattle for the Levites.
14035010 The service was arranged and the priests stood in their places with the Levites in their divisions as the king had ordered.
14035011 The Passover lambs were slaughtered, and the priests splashed against the altar the blood handed to them, while the Levites skinned the animals.
14035012 They set aside the burnt offerings to give them to the subdivisions of the families of the people to offer to the Lord, as it is written in the Book of Moses. They did the same with the cattle.
14035013 They roasted the Passover animals over the fire as prescribed, and boiled the holy offerings in pots, caldrons and pans and served them quickly to all the people.
14035014 After this, they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were sacrificing the burnt offerings and the fat portions until nightfall. So the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the Aaronic priests.
14035015 The musicians, the descendants of Asaph, were in the places prescribed by David, Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun the king’s seer. The gatekeepers at each gate did not need to leave their posts, because their fellow Levites made the preparations for them.
14035016 So at that time the entire service of the Lord was carried out for the celebration of the Passover and the offering of burnt offerings on the altar of the Lord, as King Josiah had ordered.
14035017 The Israelites who were present celebrated the Passover at that time and observed the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days.
14035018 The Passover had not been observed like this in Israel since the days of the prophet Samuel; and none of the kings of Israel had ever celebrated such a Passover as did Josiah, with the priests, the Levites and all Judah and Israel who were there with the people of Jerusalem.
14035019 This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign.
14035020 After all this, when Josiah had set the temple in order, Necho king of Egypt went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah marched out to meet him in battle.
14035021 But Necho sent messengers to him, saying, “What quarrel is there, king of Judah, between you and me? It is not you I am attacking at this time, but the house with which I am at war. God has told me to hurry; so stop opposing God, who is with me, or he will destroy you.”
14035022 Josiah, however, would not turn away from him, but disguised himself to engage him in battle. He would not listen to what Necho had said at God’s command but went to fight him on the plain of Megiddo.
14035023 Archers shot King Josiah, and he told his officers, “Take me away; I am badly wounded.”
14035024 So they took him out of his chariot, put him in his other chariot and brought him to Jerusalem, where he died. He was buried in the tombs of his ancestors, and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him.
14035025 Jeremiah composed laments for Josiah, and to this day all the male and female singers commemorate Josiah in the laments. These became a tradition in Israel and are written in the Laments.
14035026 The other events of Josiah’s reign and his acts of devotion in accordance with what is written in the Law of the Lord—
14035027 all the events, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
14036001 And the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and made him king in Jerusalem in place of his father.
14036002 Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months.
14036003 The king of Egypt dethroned him in Jerusalem and imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
14036004 The king of Egypt made Eliakim, a brother of Jehoahaz, king over Judah and Jerusalem and changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. But Necho took Eliakim’s brother Jehoahaz and carried him off to Egypt.
14036005 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. He did evil in the eyes of the Lord his God.
14036006 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked him and bound him with bronze shackles to take him to Babylon.
14036007 Nebuchadnezzar also took to Babylon articles from the temple of the Lord and put them in his temple there.
14036008 The other events of Jehoiakim’s reign, the detestable things he did and all that was found against him, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son succeeded him as king.
14036009 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months and ten days. He did evil in the eyes of the Lord.
14036010 In the spring, King Nebuchadnezzar sent for him and brought him to Babylon, together with articles of value from the temple of the Lord, and he made Jehoiachin’s uncle, Zedekiah, king over Judah and Jerusalem.
14036011 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years.
14036012 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord his God and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke the word of the Lord.
14036013 He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him take an oath in God’s name. He became stiff-necked and hardened his heart and would not turn to the Lord, the God of Israel.
14036014 Furthermore, all the leaders of the priests and the people became more and more unfaithful, following all the detestable practices of the nations and defiling the temple of the Lord, which he had consecrated in Jerusalem.
14036015 The Lord, the God of their ancestors, sent word to them through his messengers again and again, because he had pity on his people and on his dwelling place.
14036016 But they mocked God’s messengers, despised his words and scoffed at his prophets until the wrath of the Lord was aroused against his people and there was no remedy.
14036017 He brought up against them the king of the Babylonians, who killed their young men with the sword in the sanctuary, and did not spare young men or young women, the elderly or the infirm. God gave them all into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar.
14036018 He carried to Babylon all the articles from the temple of God, both large and small, and the treasures of the Lord’s temple and the treasures of the king and his officials.
14036019 They set fire to God’s temple and broke down the wall of Jerusalem; they burned all the palaces and destroyed everything of value there.
14036020 He carried into exile to Babylon the remnant, who escaped from the sword, and they became servants to him and his successors until the kingdom of Persia came to power.
14036021 The land enjoyed its sabbath rests; all the time of its desolation it rested, until the seventy years were completed in fulfillment of the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah.
14036022 In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah, the Lord moved the heart of Cyrus king of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and also to put it in writing:
14036023 “This is what Cyrus king of Persia says: “ ‘The Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah. Any of his people among you may go up, and may the Lord their God be with them.’ ”
15001001 In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah, the Lord moved the heart of Cyrus king of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and also to put it in writing:
15001002 “This is what Cyrus king of Persia says: “ ‘The Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah.
15001003 Any of his people among you may go up to Jerusalem in Judah and build the temple of the Lord, the God of Israel, the God who is in Jerusalem, and may their God be with them.
15001004 And in any locality where survivors may now be living, the people are to provide them with silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with freewill offerings for the temple of God in Jerusalem.’ ”
15001005 Then the family heads of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and Levites—everyone whose heart God had moved—prepared to go up and build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem.
15001006 All their neighbors assisted them with articles of silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with valuable gifts, in addition to all the freewill offerings.
15001007 Moreover, King Cyrus brought out the articles belonging to the temple of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of his god.
15001008 Cyrus king of Persia had them brought by Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.
15001009 This was the inventory: gold dishes 30 silver dishes 1,000 silver pans 29
15001010 gold bowls 30 matching silver bowls 410 other articles 1,000
15001011 In all, there were 5,400 articles of gold and of silver. Sheshbazzar brought all these along with the exiles when they came up from Babylon to Jerusalem.
15002001 Now these are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken captive to Babylon (they returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to their own town,
15002002 in company with Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum and Baanah): The list of the men of the people of Israel:

15002057 Shephatiah, Hattil, Pokereth-Hazzebaim and Ami
15002058 The temple servants and the descendants of the servants of Solomon 392
15002059 The following came up from the towns of Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Kerub, Addon and Immer, but they could not show that their families were descended from Israel:
15002060 The descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah and Nekoda 652
15002061 And from among the priests: The descendants of Hobaiah, Hakkoz and Barzillai (a man who had married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by that name).
15002062 These searched for their family records, but they could not find them and so were excluded from the priesthood as unclean.
15002063 The governor ordered them not to eat any of the most sacred food until there was a priest ministering with the Urim and Thummim.
15002064 The whole company numbered 42,360,
15002065 besides their 7,337 male and female slaves; and they also had 200 male and female singers.
15002066 They had 736 horses, 245 mules,
15002067 435 camels and 6,720 donkeys.
15002068 When they arrived at the house of the Lord in Jerusalem, some of the heads of the families gave freewill offerings toward the rebuilding of the house of God on its site.
15002069 According to their ability they gave to the treasury for this work 61,000 darics of gold, 5,000 minas of silver and 100 priestly garments.
15002070 The priests, the Levites, the musicians, the gatekeepers and the temple servants settled in their own towns, along with some of the other people, and the rest of the Israelites settled in their towns.
15003001 When the seventh month came and the Israelites had settled in their towns, the people assembled together as one in Jerusalem.
15003002 Then Joshua son of Jozadak and his fellow priests and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his associates began to build the altar of the God of Israel to sacrifice burnt offerings on it, in accordance with what is written in the Law of Moses the man of God.
15003003 Despite their fear of the peoples around them, they built the altar on its foundation and sacrificed burnt offerings on it to the Lord, both the morning and evening sacrifices.
15003004 Then in accordance with what is written, they celebrated the Festival of Tabernacles with the required number of burnt offerings prescribed for each day.
15003005 After that, they presented the regular burnt offerings, the New Moon sacrifices and the sacrifices for all the appointed sacred festivals of the Lord, as well as those brought as freewill offerings to the Lord.
15003006 On the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the Lord, though the foundation of the Lord’s temple had not yet been laid.
15003007 Then they gave money to the masons and carpenters, and gave food and drink and olive oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre, so that they would bring cedar logs by sea from Lebanon to Joppa, as authorized by Cyrus king of Persia.
15003008 In the second month of the second year after their arrival at the house of God in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jozadak and the rest of the people (the priests and the Levites and all who had returned from the captivity to Jerusalem) began the work. They appointed Levites twenty years old and older to supervise the building of the house of the Lord.
15003009 Joshua and his sons and brothers and Kadmiel and his sons (descendants of Hodaviah ) and the sons of Henadad and their sons and brothers—all Levites—joined together in supervising those working on the house of God.
15003010 When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, the priests in their vestments and with trumpets, and the Levites (the sons of Asaph) with cymbals, took their places to praise the Lord, as prescribed by David king of Israel.
15003011 With praise and thanksgiving they sang to the Lord: “He is good; his love toward Israel endures forever.” And all the people gave a great shout of praise to the Lord, because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid.
15003012 But many of the older priests and Levites and family heads, who had seen the former temple, wept aloud when they saw the foundation of this temple being laid, while many others shouted for joy.
15003013 No one could distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping, because the people made so much noise. And the sound was heard far away.
15004001 When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were building a temple for the Lord, the God of Israel,
15004002 they came to Zerubbabel and to the heads of the families and said, “Let us help you build because, like you, we seek your God and have been sacrificing to him since the time of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us here.”
15004003 But Zerubbabel, Joshua and the rest of the heads of the families of Israel answered, “You have no part with us in building a temple to our God. We alone will build it for the Lord, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of Persia, commanded us.”
15004004 Then the peoples around them set out to discourage the people of Judah and make them afraid to go on building.
15004005 They bribed officials to work against them and frustrate their plans during the entire reign of Cyrus king of Persia and down to the reign of Darius king of Persia.
15004006 At the beginning of the reign of Xerxes, they lodged an accusation against the people of Judah and Jerusalem.
15004007 And in the days of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and the rest of his associates wrote a letter to Artaxerxes. The letter was written in Aramaic script and in the Aramaic language.
15004008 Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows:
15004009 Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary, together with the rest of their associates—the judges, officials and administrators over the people from Persia, Uruk and Babylon, the Elamites of Susa,
15004010 and the other people whom the great and honorable Ashurbanipal deported and settled in the city of Samaria and elsewhere in Trans-Euphrates.
15004011 (This is a copy of the letter they sent him.) To King Artaxerxes, From your servants in Trans-Euphrates:
15004012 The king should know that the people who came up to us from you have gone to Jerusalem and are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city. They are restoring the walls and repairing the foundations.
15004013 Furthermore, the king should know that if this city is built and its walls are restored, no more taxes, tribute or duty will be paid, and eventually the royal revenues will suffer.
15004014 Now since we are under obligation to the palace and it is not proper for us to see the king dishonored, we are sending this message to inform the king,
15004015 so that a search may be made in the archives of your predecessors. In these records you will find that this city is a rebellious city, troublesome to kings and provinces, a place with a long history of sedition. That is why this city was destroyed.
15004016 We inform the king that if this city is built and its walls are restored, you will be left with nothing in Trans-Euphrates.
15004017 The king sent this reply: To Rehum the commanding officer, Shimshai the secretary and the rest of their associates living in Samaria and elsewhere in Trans-Euphrates: Greetings.
15004018 The letter you sent us has been read and translated in my presence.
15004019 I issued an order and a search was made, and it was found that this city has a long history of revolt against kings and has been a place of rebellion and sedition.
15004020 Jerusalem has had powerful kings ruling over the whole of Trans-Euphrates, and taxes, tribute and duty were paid to them.
15004021 Now issue an order to these men to stop work, so that this city will not be rebuilt until I so order.
15004022 Be careful not to neglect this matter. Why let this threat grow, to the detriment of the royal interests?
15004023 As soon as the copy of the letter of King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum and Shimshai the secretary and their associates, they went immediately to the Jews in Jerusalem and compelled them by force to stop.
15004024 Thus the work on the house of God in Jerusalem came to a standstill until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
15005001 Now Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the prophet, a descendant of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them.
15005002 Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Joshua son of Jozadak set to work to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem. And the prophets of God were with them, supporting them.
15005003 At that time Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates went to them and asked, “Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and to finish it?”
15005004 They also asked, “What are the names of those who are constructing this building?”
15005005 But the eye of their God was watching over the elders of the Jews, and they were not stopped until a report could go to Darius and his written reply be received.
15005006 This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates, the officials of Trans-Euphrates, sent to King Darius.
15005007 The report they sent him read as follows: To King Darius: Cordial greetings.
15005008 The king should know that we went to the district of Judah, to the temple of the great God. The people are building it with large stones and placing the timbers in the walls. The work is being carried on with diligence and is making rapid progress under their direction.
15005009 We questioned the elders and asked them, “Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and to finish it?”
15005010 We also asked them their names, so that we could write down the names of their leaders for your information.
15005011 This is the answer they gave us: “We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, one that a great king of Israel built and finished.
15005012 But because our ancestors angered the God of heaven, he gave them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar the Chaldean, king of Babylon, who destroyed this temple and deported the people to Babylon.
15005013 “However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God.
15005014 He even removed from the temple of Babylon the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to the temple in Babylon. Then King Cyrus gave them to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom he had appointed governor,
15005015 and he told him, ‘Take these articles and go and deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem. And rebuild the house of God on its site.’
15005016 “So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem. From that day to the present it has been under construction but is not yet finished.”
15005017 Now if it pleases the king, let a search be made in the royal archives of Babylon to see if King Cyrus did in fact issue a decree to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem. Then let the king send us his decision in this matter.
15006001 King Darius then issued an order, and they searched in the archives stored in the treasury at Babylon.
15006002 A scroll was found in the citadel of Ecbatana in the province of Media, and this was written on it: Memorandum:
15006003 In the first year of King Cyrus, the king issued a decree concerning the temple of God in Jerusalem: Let the temple be rebuilt as a place to present sacrifices, and let its foundations be laid. It is to be sixty cubits high and sixty cubits wide,
15006004 with three courses of large stones and one of timbers. The costs are to be paid by the royal treasury.
15006005 Also, the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, are to be returned to their places in the temple in Jerusalem; they are to be deposited in the house of God.
15006006 Now then, Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and you other officials of that province, stay away from there.
15006007 Do not interfere with the work on this temple of God. Let the governor of the Jews and the Jewish elders rebuild this house of God on its site.
15006008 Moreover, I hereby decree what you are to do for these elders of the Jews in the construction of this house of God: Their expenses are to be fully paid out of the royal treasury, from the revenues of Trans-Euphrates, so that the work will not stop.
15006009 Whatever is needed—young bulls, rams, male lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine and olive oil, as requested by the priests in Jerusalem—must be given them daily without fail,
15006010 so that they may offer sacrifices pleasing to the God of heaven and pray for the well-being of the king and his sons.
15006011 Furthermore, I decree that if anyone defies this edict, a beam is to be pulled from their house and they are to be impaled on it. And for this crime their house is to be made a pile of rubble.
15006012 May God, who has caused his Name to dwell there, overthrow any king or people who lifts a hand to change this decree or to destroy this temple in Jerusalem. I Darius have decreed it. Let it be carried out with diligence.
15006013 Then, because of the decree King Darius had sent, Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates carried it out with diligence.
15006014 So the elders of the Jews continued to build and prosper under the preaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, a descendant of Iddo. They finished building the temple according to the command of the God of Israel and the decrees of Cyrus, Darius and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia.
15006015 The temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
15006016 Then the people of Israel—the priests, the Levites and the rest of the exiles—celebrated the dedication of the house of God with joy.
15006017 For the dedication of this house of God they offered a hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred male lambs and, as a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, one for each of the tribes of Israel.
15006018 And they installed the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their groups for the service of God at Jerusalem, according to what is written in the Book of Moses.
15006019 On the fourteenth day of the first month, the exiles celebrated the Passover.
15006020 The priests and Levites had purified themselves and were all ceremonially clean. The Levites slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the exiles, for their relatives the priests and for themselves.
15006021 So the Israelites who had returned from the exile ate it, together with all who had separated themselves from the unclean practices of their Gentile neighbors in order to seek the Lord, the God of Israel.
15006022 For seven days they celebrated with joy the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because the Lord had filled them with joy by changing the attitude of the king of Assyria so that he assisted them in the work on the house of God, the God of Israel.
15007001 After these things, during the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,
15007002 the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,
15007003 the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
15007004 the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
15007005 the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest—
15007006 this Ezra came up from Babylon. He was a teacher well versed in the Law of Moses, which the Lord, the God of Israel, had given. The king had granted him everything he asked, for the hand of the Lord his God was on him.
15007007 Some of the Israelites, including priests, Levites, musicians, gatekeepers and temple servants, also came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.
15007008 Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king.
15007009 He had begun his journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month, and he arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, for the gracious hand of his God was on him.
15007010 For Ezra had devoted himself to the study and observance of the Law of the Lord, and to teaching its decrees and laws in Israel.
15007011 This is a copy of the letter King Artaxerxes had given to Ezra the priest, a teacher of the Law, a man learned in matters concerning the commands and decrees of the Lord for Israel:
15007012 Artaxerxes, king of kings, To Ezra the priest, teacher of the Law of the God of heaven: Greetings.
15007013 Now I decree that any of the Israelites in my kingdom, including priests and Levites, who volunteer to go to Jerusalem with you, may go.
15007014 You are sent by the king and his seven advisers to inquire about Judah and Jerusalem with regard to the Law of your God, which is in your hand.
15007015 Moreover, you are to take with you the silver and gold that the king and his advisers have freely given to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,
15007016 together with all the silver and gold you may obtain from the province of Babylon, as well as the freewill offerings of the people and priests for the temple of their God in Jerusalem.
15007017 With this money be sure to buy bulls, rams and male lambs, together with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and sacrifice them on the altar of the temple of your God in Jerusalem.
15007018 You and your fellow Israelites may then do whatever seems best with the rest of the silver and gold, in accordance with the will of your God.
15007019 Deliver to the God of Jerusalem all the articles entrusted to you for worship in the temple of your God.
15007020 And anything else needed for the temple of your God that you are responsible to supply, you may provide from the royal treasury.
15007021 Now I, King Artaxerxes, decree that all the treasurers of Trans-Euphrates are to provide with diligence whatever Ezra the priest, the teacher of the Law of the God of heaven, may ask of you—
15007022 up to a hundred talents of silver, a hundred cors of wheat, a hundred baths of wine, a hundred baths of olive oil, and salt without limit.
15007023 Whatever the God of heaven has prescribed, let it be done with diligence for the temple of the God of heaven. Why should his wrath fall on the realm of the king and of his sons?
15007024 You are also to know that you have no authority to impose taxes, tribute or duty on any of the priests, Levites, musicians, gatekeepers, temple servants or other workers at this house of God.
15007025 And you, Ezra, in accordance with the wisdom of your God, which you possess, appoint magistrates and judges to administer justice to all the people of Trans-Euphrates—all who know the laws of your God. And you are to teach any who do not know them.
15007026 Whoever does not obey the law of your God and the law of the king must surely be punished by death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment.
15007027 Praise be to the Lord, the God of our ancestors, who has put it into the king’s heart to bring honor to the house of the Lord in Jerusalem in this way
15007028 and who has extended his good favor to me before the king and his advisers and all the king’s powerful officials. Because the hand of the Lord my God was on me, I took courage and gathered leaders from Israel to go up with me.
15008001 These are the family heads and those registered with them who came up with me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes:
15008002 of the descendants of Phinehas, Gershom; of the descendants of Ithamar, Daniel; of the descendants of David, Hattush
15008003 of the descendants of Shekaniah; of the descendants of Parosh, Zechariah, and with him were registered 150 men;
15008004 of the descendants of Pahath-Moab, Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah, and with him 200 men;
15008005 of the descendants of Zattu, Shekaniah son of Jahaziel, and with him 300 men;
15008006 of the descendants of Adin, Ebed son of Jonathan, and with him 50 men;
15008007 of the descendants of Elam, Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, and with him 70 men;
15008008 of the descendants of Shephatiah, Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him 80 men;
15008009 of the descendants of Joab, Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him 218 men;
15008010 of the descendants of Bani, Shelomith son of Josiphiah, and with him 160 men;
15008011 of the descendants of Bebai, Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him 28 men;
15008012 of the descendants of Azgad, Johanan son of Hakkatan, and with him 110 men;
15008013 of the descendants of Adonikam, the last ones, whose names were Eliphelet, Jeuel and Shemaiah, and with them 60 men;
15008014 of the descendants of Bigvai, Uthai and Zakkur, and with them 70 men.
15008015 I assembled them at the canal that flows toward Ahava, and we camped there three days. When I checked among the people and the priests, I found no Levites there.
15008016 So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam, who were leaders, and Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of learning,
15008017 and I ordered them to go to Iddo, the leader in Kasiphia. I told them what to say to Iddo and his fellow Levites, the temple servants in Kasiphia, so that they might bring attendants to us for the house of our God.
15008018 Because the gracious hand of our God was on us, they brought us Sherebiah, a capable man, from the descendants of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel, and Sherebiah’s sons and brothers, 18 in all;
15008019 and Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and nephews, 20 in all.
15008020 They also brought 220 of the temple servants—a body that David and the officials had established to assist the Levites. All were registered by name.
15008021 There, by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions.
15008022 I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, “The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him.”
15008023 So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer.
15008024 Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, namely, Sherebiah, Hashabiah and ten of their brothers,
15008025 and I weighed out to them the offering of silver and gold and the articles that the king, his advisers, his officials and all Israel present there had donated for the house of our God.
15008026 I weighed out to them 650 talents of silver, silver articles weighing 100 talents, 100 talents of gold,
15008027 20 bowls of gold valued at 1,000 darics, and two fine articles of polished bronze, as precious as gold.
15008028 I said to them, “You as well as these articles are consecrated to the Lord. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the Lord, the God of your ancestors.
15008029 Guard them carefully until you weigh them out in the chambers of the house of the Lord in Jerusalem before the leading priests and the Levites and the family heads of Israel.”
15008030 Then the priests and Levites received the silver and gold and sacred articles that had been weighed out to be taken to the house of our God in Jerusalem.
15008031 On the twelfth day of the first month we set out from the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he protected us from enemies and bandits along the way.
15008032 So we arrived in Jerusalem, where we rested three days.
15008033 On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out the silver and gold and the sacred articles into the hands of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him, and so were the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui.
15008034 Everything was accounted for by number and weight, and the entire weight was recorded at that time.
15008035 Then the exiles who had returned from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven male lambs and, as a sin offering, twelve male goats. All this was a burnt offering to the Lord.
15008036 They also delivered the king’s orders to the royal satraps and to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, who then gave assistance to the people and to the house of God.
15009001 After these things had been done, the leaders came to me and said, “The people of Israel, including the priests and the Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices, like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians and Amorites.
15009002 They have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, and have mingled the holy race with the peoples around them. And the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness.”
15009003 When I heard this, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled.
15009004 Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles. And I sat there appalled until the evening sacrifice.
15009005 Then, at the evening sacrifice, I rose from my self-abasement, with my tunic and cloak torn, and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the Lord my God
15009006 and prayed: “I am too ashamed and disgraced, my God, to lift up my face to you, because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens.
15009007 From the days of our ancestors until now, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings, as it is today.
15009008 “But now, for a brief moment, the Lord our God has been gracious in leaving us a remnant and giving us a firm place in his sanctuary, and so our God gives light to our eyes and a little relief in our bondage.
15009009 Though we are slaves, our God has not forsaken us in our bondage. He has shown us kindness in the sight of the kings of Persia: He has granted us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins, and he has given us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem.
15009010 “But now, our God, what can we say after this? For we have forsaken the commands
15009011 you gave through your servants the prophets when you said: ‘The land you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples. By their detestable practices they have filled it with their impurity from one end to the other.
15009012 Therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them at any time, that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance.’
15009013 “What has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt, and yet, our God, you have punished us less than our sins deserved and have given us a remnant like this.
15009014 Shall we then break your commands again and intermarry with the peoples who commit such detestable practices? Would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us, leaving us no remnant or survivor?
15009015 Lord, the God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence.”
15010001 While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a large crowd of Israelites—men, women and children—gathered around him. They too wept bitterly.
15010002 Then Shekaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra, “We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel.
15010003 Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their children, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law.
15010004 Rise up; this matter is in your hands. We will support you, so take courage and do it.”
15010005 So Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel under oath to do what had been suggested. And they took the oath.
15010006 Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no food and drank no water, because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.
15010007 A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem.
15010008 Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property, in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders, and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles.
15010009 Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain.
15010010 Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel’s guilt.
15010011 Now honor the Lord, the God of your ancestors, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives.”
15010012 The whole assembly responded with a loud voice: “You are right! We must do as you say.
15010013 But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing.
15010014 Let our officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us.”
15010015 Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this.
15010016 So the exiles did as was proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases,
15010017 and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women.
15010018 Among the descendants of the priests, the following had married foreign women: From the descendants of Joshua son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib and Gedaliah.
15010019 (They all gave their hands in pledge to put away their wives, and for their guilt they each presented a ram from the flock as a guilt offering.)
15010020 From the descendants of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah.
15010021 From the descendants of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel and Uzziah.
15010022 From the descendants of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad and Elasah.
15010023 Among the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (that is, Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah and Eliezer.
15010024 From the musicians: Eliashib. From the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem and Uri.
15010025 And among the other Israelites: From the descendants of Parosh: Ramiah, Izziah, Malkijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malkijah and Benaiah.
15010026 From the descendants of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth and Elijah.
15010027 From the descendants of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad and Aziza.
15010028 From the descendants of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai and Athlai.
15010029 From the descendants of Bani: Meshullam, Malluk, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal and Jeremoth.
15010030 From the descendants of Pahath-Moab: Adna, Kelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui and Manasseh.
15010031 From the descendants of Harim: Eliezer, Ishijah, Malkijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,
15010032 Benjamin, Malluk and Shemariah.
15010033 From the descendants of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh and Shimei.
15010034 From the descendants of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel,
15010035 Benaiah, Bedeiah, Keluhi,
15010036 Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,
15010037 Mattaniah, Mattenai and Jaasu.
15010038 From the descendants of Binnui: Shimei,
15010039 Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah,
15010040 Maknadebai, Shashai, Sharai,
15010041 Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah,
15010042 Shallum, Amariah and Joseph.
15010043 From the descendants of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel and Benaiah.
15010044 All these had married foreign women, and some of them had children by these wives.
16001001 The words of Nehemiah son of Hakaliah: In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year, while I was in the citadel of Susa,
16001002 Hanani, one of my brothers, came from Judah with some other men, and I questioned them about the Jewish remnant that had survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem.
16001003 They said to me, “Those who survived the exile and are back in the province are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.”
16001004 When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven.
16001005 Then I said: “Lord, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and keep his commandments,
16001006 let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night for your servants, the people of Israel. I confess the sins we Israelites, including myself and my father’s family, have committed against you.
16001007 We have acted very wickedly toward you. We have not obeyed the commands, decrees and laws you gave your servant Moses.
16001008 “Remember the instruction you gave your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations,
16001009 but if you return to me and obey my commands, then even if your exiled people are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my Name.’
16001010 “They are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great strength and your mighty hand.
16001011 Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight in revering your name. Give your servant success today by granting him favor in the presence of this man.” I was cupbearer to the king.
16002001 In the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was brought for him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had not been sad in his presence before,
16002002 so the king asked me, “Why does your face look so sad when you are not ill? This can be nothing but sadness of heart.” I was very much afraid,
16002003 but I said to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should my face not look sad when the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?”
16002004 The king said to me, “What is it you want?” Then I prayed to the God of heaven,
16002005 and I answered the king, “If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in his sight, let him send me to the city in Judah where my ancestors are buried so that I can rebuild it.”
16002006 Then the king, with the queen sitting beside him, asked me, “How long will your journey take, and when will you get back?” It pleased the king to send me; so I set a time.
16002007 I also said to him, “If it pleases the king, may I have letters to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, so that they will provide me safe-conduct until I arrive in Judah?
16002008 And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper of the royal park, so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple and for the city wall and for the residence I will occupy?” And because the gracious hand of my God was on me, the king granted my requests.
16002009 So I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates and gave them the king’s letters. The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me.
16002010 When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about this, they were very much disturbed that someone had come to promote the welfare of the Israelites.
16002011 I went to Jerusalem, and after staying there three days
16002012 I set out during the night with a few others. I had not told anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no mounts with me except the one I was riding on.
16002013 By night I went out through the Valley Gate toward the Jackal Well and the Dung Gate, examining the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken down, and its gates, which had been destroyed by fire.
16002014 Then I moved on toward the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but there was not enough room for my mount to get through;
16002015 so I went up the valley by night, examining the wall. Finally, I turned back and reentered through the Valley Gate.
16002016 The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because as yet I had said nothing to the Jews or the priests or nobles or officials or any others who would be doing the work.
16002017 Then I said to them, “You see the trouble we are in: Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in disgrace.”
16002018 I also told them about the gracious hand of my God on me and what the king had said to me. They replied, “Let us start rebuilding.” So they began this good work.
16002019 But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked and ridiculed us. “What is this you are doing?” they asked. “Are you rebelling against the king?”
16002020 I answered them by saying, “The God of heaven will give us success. We his servants will start rebuilding, but as for you, you have no share in Jerusalem or any claim or historic right to it.”
16003001 Eliashib the high priest and his fellow priests went to work and rebuilt the Sheep Gate. They dedicated it and set its doors in place, building as far as the Tower of the Hundred, which they dedicated, and as far as the Tower of Hananel.
16003002 The men of Jericho built the adjoining section, and Zakkur son of Imri built next to them.
16003003 The Fish Gate was rebuilt by the sons of Hassenaah. They laid its beams and put its doors and bolts and bars in place.
16003004 Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, repaired the next section. Next to him Meshullam son of Berekiah, the son of Meshezabel, made repairs, and next to him Zadok son of Baana also made repairs.
16003005 The next section was repaired by the men of Tekoa, but their nobles would not put their shoulders to the work under their supervisors.
16003006 The Jeshanah Gate was repaired by Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah. They laid its beams and put its doors with their bolts and bars in place.
16003007 Next to them, repairs were made by men from Gibeon and Mizpah—Melatiah of Gibeon and Jadon of Meronoth—places under the authority of the governor of Trans-Euphrates.
16003008 Uzziel son of Harhaiah, one of the goldsmiths, repaired the next section; and Hananiah, one of the perfume-makers, made repairs next to that. They restored Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall.
16003009 Rephaiah son of Hur, ruler of a half-district of Jerusalem, repaired the next section.
16003010 Adjoining this, Jedaiah son of Harumaph made repairs opposite his house, and Hattush son of Hashabneiah made repairs next to him.
16003011 Malkijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-Moab repaired another section and the Tower of the Ovens.
16003012 Shallum son of Hallohesh, ruler of a half-district of Jerusalem, repaired the next section with the help of his daughters.
16003013 The Valley Gate was repaired by Hanun and the residents of Zanoah. They rebuilt it and put its doors with their bolts and bars in place. They also repaired a thousand cubits of the wall as far as the Dung Gate.
16003014 The Dung Gate was repaired by Malkijah son of Rekab, ruler of the district of Beth Hakkerem. He rebuilt it and put its doors with their bolts and bars in place.
16003015 The Fountain Gate was repaired by Shallun son of Kol-Hozeh, ruler of the district of Mizpah. He rebuilt it, roofing it over and putting its doors and bolts and bars in place. He also repaired the wall of the Pool of Siloam, by the King’s Garden, as far as the steps going down from the City of David.
16003016 Beyond him, Nehemiah son of Azbuk, ruler of a half-district of Beth Zur, made repairs up to a point opposite the tombs of David, as far as the artificial pool and the House of the Heroes.
16003017 Next to him, the repairs were made by the Levites under Rehum son of Bani. Beside him, Hashabiah, ruler of half the district of Keilah, carried out repairs for his district.
16003018 Next to him, the repairs were made by their fellow Levites under Binnui son of Henadad, ruler of the other half-district of Keilah.
16003019 Next to him, Ezer son of Jeshua, ruler of Mizpah, repaired another section, from a point facing the ascent to the armory as far as the angle of the wall.
16003020 Next to him, Baruch son of Zabbai zealously repaired another section, from the angle to the entrance of the house of Eliashib the high priest.
16003021 Next to him, Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, repaired another section, from the entrance of Eliashib’s house to the end of it.
16003022 The repairs next to him were made by the priests from the surrounding region.
16003023 Beyond them, Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs in front of their house; and next to them, Azariah son of Maaseiah, the son of Ananiah, made repairs beside his house.
16003024 Next to him, Binnui son of Henadad repaired another section, from Azariah’s house to the angle and the corner,
16003025 and Palal son of Uzai worked opposite the angle and the tower projecting from the upper palace near the court of the guard. Next to him, Pedaiah son of Parosh
16003026 and the temple servants living on the hill of Ophel made repairs up to a point opposite the Water Gate toward the east and the projecting tower.
16003027 Next to them, the men of Tekoa repaired another section, from the great projecting tower to the wall of Ophel.
16003028 Above the Horse Gate, the priests made repairs, each in front of his own house.
16003029 Next to them, Zadok son of Immer made repairs opposite his house. Next to him, Shemaiah son of Shekaniah, the guard at the East Gate, made repairs.
16003030 Next to him, Hananiah son of Shelemiah, and Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph, repaired another section. Next to them, Meshullam son of Berekiah made repairs opposite his living quarters.
16003031 Next to him, Malkijah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs as far as the house of the temple servants and the merchants, opposite the Inspection Gate, and as far as the room above the corner;
16003032 and between the room above the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and merchants made repairs.
16004001 When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became angry and was greatly incensed. He ridiculed the Jews,
16004002 and in the presence of his associates and the army of Samaria, he said, “What are those feeble Jews doing? Will they restore their wall? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Can they bring the stones back to life from those heaps of rubble—burned as they are?”
16004003 Tobiah the Ammonite, who was at his side, said, “What they are building—even a fox climbing up on it would break down their wall of stones!”
16004004 Hear us, our God, for we are despised. Turn their insults back on their own heads. Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity.
16004005 Do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from your sight, for they have thrown insults in the face of the builders.
16004006 So we rebuilt the wall till all of it reached half its height, for the people worked with all their heart.
16004007 But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the people of Ashdod heard that the repairs to Jerusalem’s walls had gone ahead and that the gaps were being closed, they were very angry.
16004008 They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and stir up trouble against it.
16004009 But we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat.
16004010 Meanwhile, the people in Judah said, “The strength of the laborers is giving out, and there is so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall.”
16004011 Also our enemies said, “Before they know it or see us, we will be right there among them and will kill them and put an end to the work.”
16004012 Then the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times over, “Wherever you turn, they will attack us.”
16004013 Therefore I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places, posting them by families, with their swords, spears and bows.
16004014 After I looked things over, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “Don’t be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.”
16004015 When our enemies heard that we were aware of their plot and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to our own work.
16004016 From that day on, half of my men did the work, while the other half were equipped with spears, shields, bows and armor. The officers posted themselves behind all the people of Judah
16004017 who were building the wall. Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other,
16004018 and each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked. But the man who sounded the trumpet stayed with me.
16004019 Then I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “The work is extensive and spread out, and we are widely separated from each other along the wall.
16004020 Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, join us there. Our God will fight for us!”
16004021 So we continued the work with half the men holding spears, from the first light of dawn till the stars came out.
16004022 At that time I also said to the people, “Have every man and his helper stay inside Jerusalem at night, so they can serve us as guards by night and as workers by day.”
16004023 Neither I nor my brothers nor my men nor the guards with me took off our clothes; each had his weapon, even when he went for water.
16005001 Now the men and their wives raised a great outcry against their fellow Jews.
16005002 Some were saying, “We and our sons and daughters are numerous; in order for us to eat and stay alive, we must get grain.”
16005003 Others were saying, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards and our homes to get grain during the famine.”
16005004 Still others were saying, “We have had to borrow money to pay the king’s tax on our fields and vineyards.
16005005 Although we are of the same flesh and blood as our fellow Jews and though our children are as good as theirs, yet we have to subject our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but we are powerless, because our fields and our vineyards belong to others.”
16005006 When I heard their outcry and these charges, I was very angry.
16005007 I pondered them in my mind and then accused the nobles and officials. I told them, “You are charging your own people interest!” So I called together a large meeting to deal with them
16005008 and said: “As far as possible, we have bought back our fellow Jews who were sold to the Gentiles. Now you are selling your own people, only for them to be sold back to us!” They kept quiet, because they could find nothing to say.
16005009 So I continued, “What you are doing is not right. Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our Gentile enemies?
16005010 I and my brothers and my men are also lending the people money and grain. But let us stop charging interest!
16005011 Give back to them immediately their fields, vineyards, olive groves and houses, and also the interest you are charging them—one percent of the money, grain, new wine and olive oil.”
16005012 “We will give it back,” they said. “And we will not demand anything more from them. We will do as you say.” Then I summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials take an oath to do what they had promised.
16005013 I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, “In this way may God shake out of their house and possessions anyone who does not keep this promise. So may such a person be shaken out and emptied!” At this the whole assembly said, “Amen,” and praised the Lord. And the people did as they had promised.
16005014 Moreover, from the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, until his thirty-second year—twelve years—neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor.
16005015 But the earlier governors—those preceding me—placed a heavy burden on the people and took forty shekels of silver from them in addition to food and wine. Their assistants also lorded it over the people. But out of reverence for God I did not act like that.
16005016 Instead, I devoted myself to the work on this wall. All my men were assembled there for the work; we did not acquire any land.
16005017 Furthermore, a hundred and fifty Jews and officials ate at my table, as well as those who came to us from the surrounding nations.
16005018 Each day one ox, six choice sheep and some poultry were prepared for me, and every ten days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds. In spite of all this, I never demanded the food allotted to the governor, because the demands were heavy on these people.
16005019 Remember me with favor, my God, for all I have done for these people.
16006001 When word came to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it—though up to that time I had not set the doors in the gates—
16006002 Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: “Come, let us meet together in one of the villages on the plain of Ono.” But they were scheming to harm me;
16006003 so I sent messengers to them with this reply: “I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?”
16006004 Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave them the same answer.
16006005 Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent his aide to me with the same message, and in his hand was an unsealed letter
16006006 in which was written: “It is reported among the nations—and Geshem says it is true—that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and therefore you are building the wall. Moreover, according to these reports you are about to become their king
16006007 and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem: ‘There is a king in Judah!’ Now this report will get back to the king; so come, let us meet together.”
16006008 I sent him this reply: “Nothing like what you are saying is happening; you are just making it up out of your head.”
16006009 They were all trying to frighten us, thinking, “Their hands will get too weak for the work, and it will not be completed.” But I prayed, “Now strengthen my hands.”
16006010 One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home. He said, “Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the temple doors, because men are coming to kill you—by night they are coming to kill you.”
16006011 But I said, “Should a man like me run away? Or should someone like me go into the temple to save his life? I will not go!”
16006012 I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
16006013 He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing this, and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me.
16006014 Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, my God, because of what they have done; remember also the prophet Noadiah and how she and the rest of the prophets have been trying to intimidate me.
16006015 So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days.
16006016 When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self-confidence, because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our God.
16006017 Also, in those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah, and replies from Tobiah kept coming to them.
16006018 For many in Judah were under oath to him, since he was son-in-law to Shekaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah.
16006019 Moreover, they kept reporting to me his good deeds and then telling him what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.
16007001 After the wall had been rebuilt and I had set the doors in place, the gatekeepers, the musicians and the Levites were appointed.
16007002 I put in charge of Jerusalem my brother Hanani, along with Hananiah the commander of the citadel, because he was a man of integrity and feared God more than most people do.
16007003 I said to them, “The gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until the sun is hot. While the gatekeepers are still on duty, have them shut the doors and bar them. Also appoint residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at their posts and some near their own houses.”
16007004 Now the city was large and spacious, but there were few people in it, and the houses had not yet been rebuilt.
16007005 So my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials and the common people for registration by families. I found the genealogical record of those who had been the first to return. This is what I found written there:
16007006 These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken captive (they returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own town,
16007007 in company with Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum and Baanah): The list of the men of Israel:
16007008 the descendants of Parosh 2,172
16007009 of Shephatiah 372
16007010 of Arah 652
16007011 of Pahath-Moab (through the line of Jeshua and Joab) 2,818
16007012 of Elam 1,254
16007013 of Zattu 845
16007014 of Zakkai 760
16007015 of Binnui 648
16007016 of Bebai 628
16007017 of Azgad 2,322
16007018 of Adonikam 667

16007058 Jaala, Darkon, Giddel,
16007059 Shephatiah, Hattil, Pokereth-Hazzebaim and Amon
16007060 The temple servants and the descendants of the servants of Solomon 392
16007061 The following came up from the towns of Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Kerub, Addon and Immer, but they could not show that their families were descended from Israel:
16007062 the descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah and Nekoda 642
16007063 And from among the priests: the descendants of Hobaiah, Hakkoz and Barzillai (a man who had married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by that name).
16007064 These searched for their family records, but they could not find them and so were excluded from the priesthood as unclean.
16007065 The governor, therefore, ordered them not to eat any of the most sacred food until there should be a priest ministering with the Urim and Thummim.
16007066 The whole company numbered 42,360,
16007067 besides their 7,337 male and female slaves; and they also had 245 male and female singers.
16007068 There were 736 horses, 245 mules,
16007069 435 camels and 6,720 donkeys.
16007070 Some of the heads of the families contributed to the work. The governor gave to the treasury 1,000 darics of gold, 50 bowls and 530 garments for priests.
16007071 Some of the heads of the families gave to the treasury for the work 20,000 darics of gold and 2,200 minas of silver.
16007072 The total given by the rest of the people was 20,000 darics of gold, 2,000 minas of silver and 67 garments for priests.
16007073 The priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the musicians and the temple servants, along with certain of the people and the rest of the Israelites, settled in their own towns. When the seventh month came and the Israelites had settled in their towns,
16008001 all the people came together as one in the square before the Water Gate. They told Ezra the teacher of the Law to bring out the Book of the Law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded for Israel.
16008002 So on the first day of the seventh month Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly, which was made up of men and women and all who were able to understand.
16008003 He read it aloud from daybreak till noon as he faced the square before the Water Gate in the presence of the men, women and others who could understand. And all the people listened attentively to the Book of the Law.
16008004 Ezra the teacher of the Law stood on a high wooden platform built for the occasion. Beside him on his right stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah and Maaseiah; and on his left were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah and Meshullam.
16008005 Ezra opened the book. All the people could see him because he was standing above them; and as he opened it, the people all stood up.
16008006 Ezra praised the Lord, the great God; and all the people lifted their hands and responded, “Amen! Amen!” Then they bowed down and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground.
16008007 The Levites—Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan and Pelaiah—instructed the people in the Law while the people were standing there.
16008008 They read from the Book of the Law of God, making it clear and giving the meaning so that the people understood what was being read.
16008009 Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and teacher of the Law, and the Levites who were instructing the people said to them all, “This day is holy to the Lord your God. Do not mourn or weep.” For all the people had been weeping as they listened to the words of the Law.
16008010 Nehemiah said, “Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks, and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is holy to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the Lord is your strength.”
16008011 The Levites calmed all the people, saying, “Be still, for this is a holy day. Do not grieve.”
16008012 Then all the people went away to eat and drink, to send portions of food and to celebrate with great joy, because they now understood the words that had been made known to them.
16008013 On the second day of the month, the heads of all the families, along with the priests and the Levites, gathered around Ezra the teacher to give attention to the words of the Law.
16008014 They found written in the Law, which the Lord had commanded through Moses, that the Israelites were to live in temporary shelters during the festival of the seventh month
16008015 and that they should proclaim this word and spread it throughout their towns and in Jerusalem: “Go out into the hill country and bring back branches from olive and wild olive trees, and from myrtles, palms and shade trees, to make temporary shelters”—as it is written.
16008016 So the people went out and brought back branches and built themselves temporary shelters on their own roofs, in their courtyards, in the courts of the house of God and in the square by the Water Gate and the one by the Gate of Ephraim.
16008017 The whole company that had returned from exile built temporary shelters and lived in them. From the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day, the Israelites had not celebrated it like this. And their joy was very great.
16008018 Day after day, from the first day to the last, Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God. They celebrated the festival for seven days, and on the eighth day, in accordance with the regulation, there was an assembly.
16009001 On the twenty-fourth day of the same month, the Israelites gathered together, fasting and wearing sackcloth and putting dust on their heads.
16009002 Those of Israelite descent had separated themselves from all foreigners. They stood in their places and confessed their sins and the sins of their ancestors.
16009003 They stood where they were and read from the Book of the Law of the Lord their God for a quarter of the day, and spent another quarter in confession and in worshiping the Lord their God.
16009004 Standing on the stairs of the Levites were Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani and Kenani. They cried out with loud voices to the Lord their God.
16009005 And the Levites—Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah and Pethahiah—said: “Stand up and praise the Lord your God, who is from everlasting to everlasting. ” “Blessed be your glorious name, and may it be exalted above all blessing and praise.
16009006 You alone are the Lord. You made the heavens, even the highest heavens, and all their starry host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them. You give life to everything, and the multitudes of heaven worship you.
16009007 “You are the Lord God, who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans and named him Abraham.
16009008 You found his heart faithful to you, and you made a covenant with him to give to his descendants the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites and Girgashites. You have kept your promise because you are righteous.
16009009 “You saw the suffering of our ancestors in Egypt; you heard their cry at the Red Sea.
16009010 You sent signs and wonders against Pharaoh, against all his officials and all the people of his land, for you knew how arrogantly the Egyptians treated them. You made a name for yourself, which remains to this day.
16009011 You divided the sea before them, so that they passed through it on dry ground, but you hurled their pursuers into the depths, like a stone into mighty waters.
16009012 By day you led them with a pillar of cloud, and by night with a pillar of fire to give them light on the way they were to take.
16009013 “You came down on Mount Sinai; you spoke to them from heaven. You gave them regulations and laws that are just and right, and decrees and commands that are good.
16009014 You made known to them your holy Sabbath and gave them commands, decrees and laws through your servant Moses.
16009015 In their hunger you gave them bread from heaven and in their thirst you brought them water from the rock; you told them to go in and take possession of the land you had sworn with uplifted hand to give them.
16009016 “But they, our ancestors, became arrogant and stiff-necked, and they did not obey your commands.
16009017 They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them. They became stiff-necked and in their rebellion appointed a leader in order to return to their slavery. But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love. Therefore you did not desert them,
16009018 even when they cast for themselves an image of a calf and said, ‘This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt,’ or when they committed awful blasphemies.
16009019 “Because of your great compassion you did not abandon them in the wilderness. By day the pillar of cloud did not fail to guide them on their path, nor the pillar of fire by night to shine on the way they were to take.
16009020 You gave your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your manna from their mouths, and you gave them water for their thirst.
16009021 For forty years you sustained them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing, their clothes did not wear out nor did their feet become swollen.
16009022 “You gave them kingdoms and nations, allotting to them even the remotest frontiers. They took over the country of Sihon king of Heshbon and the country of Og king of Bashan.
16009023 You made their children as numerous as the stars in the sky, and you brought them into the land that you told their parents to enter and possess.
16009024 Their children went in and took possession of the land. You subdued before them the Canaanites, who lived in the land; you gave the Canaanites into their hands, along with their kings and the peoples of the land, to deal with them as they pleased.
16009025 They captured fortified cities and fertile land; they took possession of houses filled with all kinds of good things, wells already dug, vineyards, olive groves and fruit trees in abundance. They ate to the full and were well-nourished; they reveled in your great goodness.
16009026 “But they were disobedient and rebelled against you; they turned their backs on your law. They killed your prophets, who had warned them in order to turn them back to you; they committed awful blasphemies.
16009027 So you delivered them into the hands of their enemies, who oppressed them. But when they were oppressed they cried out to you. From heaven you heard them, and in your great compassion you gave them deliverers, who rescued them from the hand of their enemies.
16009028 “But as soon as they were at rest, they again did what was evil in your sight. Then you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies so that they ruled over them. And when they cried out to you again, you heard from heaven, and in your compassion you delivered them time after time.
16009029 “You warned them in order to turn them back to your law, but they became arrogant and disobeyed your commands. They sinned against your ordinances, of which you said, ‘The person who obeys them will live by them.’ Stubbornly they turned their backs on you, became stiff-necked and refused to listen.
16009030 For many years you were patient with them. By your Spirit you warned them through your prophets. Yet they paid no attention, so you gave them into the hands of the neighboring peoples.
16009031 But in your great mercy you did not put an end to them or abandon them, for you are a gracious and merciful God.
16009032 “Now therefore, our God, the great God, mighty and awesome, who keeps his covenant of love, do not let all this hardship seem trifling in your eyes—the hardship that has come on us, on our kings and leaders, on our priests and prophets, on our ancestors and all your people, from the days of the kings of Assyria until today.
16009033 In all that has happened to us, you have remained righteous; you have acted faithfully, while we acted wickedly.
16009034 Our kings, our leaders, our priests and our ancestors did not follow your law; they did not pay attention to your commands or the statutes you warned them to keep.
16009035 Even while they were in their kingdom, enjoying your great goodness to them in the spacious and fertile land you gave them, they did not serve you or turn from their evil ways.
16009036 “But see, we are slaves today, slaves in the land you gave our ancestors so they could eat its fruit and the other good things it produces.
16009037 Because of our sins, its abundant harvest goes to the kings you have placed over us. They rule over our bodies and our cattle as they please. We are in great distress.
16009038 “In view of all this, we are making a binding agreement, putting it in writing, and our leaders, our Levites and our priests are affixing their seals to it.”
16010001 Those who sealed it were: Nehemiah the governor, the son of Hakaliah. Zedekiah,
16010002 Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,
16010003 Pashhur, Amariah, Malkijah,
16010004 Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluk,

16010006 Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,
16010007 Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,
16010008 Maaziah, Bilgai and Shemaiah. These were the priests.
16010009 The Levites: Jeshua son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel,
16010010 and their associates: Shebaniah, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,
16010011 Mika, Rehob, Hashabiah,
16010012 Zakkur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,
16010013 Hodiah, Bani and Beninu.
16010014 The leaders of the people: Parosh, Pahath-Moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani,
16010015 Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,
16010016 Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,
16010017 Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur,
16010018 Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai,
16010019 Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,
16010020 Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,
16010021 Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua,
16010022 Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,
16010023 Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub,
16010024 Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek,
16010025 Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,
16010026 Ahiah, Hanan, Anan,
16010027 Malluk, Harim and Baanah.
16010028 “The rest of the people—priests, Levites, gatekeepers, musicians, temple servants and all who separated themselves from the neighboring peoples for the sake of the Law of God, together with their wives and all their sons and daughters who are able to understand—
16010029 all these now join their fellow Israelites the nobles, and bind themselves with a curse and an oath to follow the Law of God given through Moses the servant of God and to obey carefully all the commands, regulations and decrees of the Lord our Lord.
16010030 “We promise not to give our daughters in marriage to the peoples around us or take their daughters for our sons.
16010031 “When the neighboring peoples bring merchandise or grain to sell on the Sabbath, we will not buy from them on the Sabbath or on any holy day. Every seventh year we will forgo working the land and will cancel all debts.
16010032 “We assume the responsibility for carrying out the commands to give a third of a shekel each year for the service of the house of our God:
16010033 for the bread set out on the table; for the regular grain offerings and burnt offerings; for the offerings on the Sabbaths, at the New Moon feasts and at the appointed festivals; for the holy offerings; for sin offerings to make atonement for Israel; and for all the duties of the house of our God.
16010034 “We—the priests, the Levites and the people—have cast lots to determine when each of our families is to bring to the house of our God at set times each year a contribution of wood to burn on the altar of the Lord our God, as it is written in the Law.
16010035 “We also assume responsibility for bringing to the house of the Lord each year the firstfruits of our crops and of every fruit tree.
16010036 “As it is also written in the Law, we will bring the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle, of our herds and of our flocks to the house of our God, to the priests ministering there.
16010037 “Moreover, we will bring to the storerooms of the house of our God, to the priests, the first of our ground meal, of our grain offerings, of the fruit of all our trees and of our new wine and olive oil. And we will bring a tithe of our crops to the Levites, for it is the Levites who collect the tithes in all the towns where we work.
16010038 A priest descended from Aaron is to accompany the Levites when they receive the tithes, and the Levites are to bring a tenth of the tithes up to the house of our God, to the storerooms of the treasury.
16010039 The people of Israel, including the Levites, are to bring their contributions of grain, new wine and olive oil to the storerooms, where the articles for the sanctuary and for the ministering priests, the gatekeepers and the musicians are also kept. “We will not neglect the house of our God.”
16011001 Now the leaders of the people settled in Jerusalem. The rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of every ten of them to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while the remaining nine were to stay in their own towns.
16011002 The people commended all who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.
16011003 These are the provincial leaders who settled in Jerusalem (now some Israelites, priests, Levites, temple servants and descendants of Solomon’s servants lived in the towns of Judah, each on their own property in the various towns,
16011004 while other people from both Judah and Benjamin lived in Jerusalem): From the descendants of Judah: Athaiah son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, a descendant of Perez;
16011005 and Maaseiah son of Baruch, the son of Kol-Hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, a descendant of Shelah.
16011006 The descendants of Perez who lived in Jerusalem totaled 468 men of standing.
16011007 From the descendants of Benjamin: Sallu son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah,
16011008 and his followers, Gabbai and Sallai—928 men.
16011009 Joel son of Zikri was their chief officer, and Judah son of Hassenuah was over the New Quarter of the city.
16011010 From the priests: Jedaiah; the son of Joiarib; Jakin;
16011011 Seraiah son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the official in charge of the house of God,
16011012 and their associates, who carried on work for the temple—822 men; Adaiah son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malkijah,
16011013 and his associates, who were heads of families—242 men; Amashsai son of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,
16011014 and his associates, who were men of standing—128. Their chief officer was Zabdiel son of Haggedolim.
16011015 From the Levites: Shemaiah son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;
16011016 Shabbethai and Jozabad, two of the heads of the Levites, who had charge of the outside work of the house of God;
16011017 Mattaniah son of Mika, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, the director who led in thanksgiving and prayer; Bakbukiah, second among his associates; and Abda son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.
16011018 The Levites in the holy city totaled 284.
16011019 The gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon and their associates, who kept watch at the gates—172 men.
16011020 The rest of the Israelites, with the priests and Levites, were in all the towns of Judah, each on their ancestral property.
16011021 The temple servants lived on the hill of Ophel, and Ziha and Gishpa were in charge of them.
16011022 The chief officer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mika. Uzzi was one of Asaph’s descendants, who were the musicians responsible for the service of the house of God.
16011023 The musicians were under the king’s orders, which regulated their daily activity.
16011024 Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, one of the descendants of Zerah son of Judah, was the king’s agent in all affairs relating to the people.
16011025 As for the villages with their fields, some of the people of Judah lived in Kiriath Arba and its surrounding settlements, in Dibon and its settlements, in Jekabzeel and its villages,
16011026 in Jeshua, in Moladah, in Beth Pelet,
16011027 in Hazar Shual, in Beersheba and its settlements,
16011028 in Ziklag, in Mekonah and its settlements,
16011029 in En Rimmon, in Zorah, in Jarmuth,
16011030 Zanoah, Adullam and their villages, in Lachish and its fields, and in Azekah and its settlements. So they were living all the way from Beersheba to the Valley of Hinnom.
16011031 The descendants of the Benjamites from Geba lived in Mikmash, Aija, Bethel and its settlements,
16011032 in Anathoth, Nob and Ananiah,
16011033 in Hazor, Ramah and Gittaim,
16011034 in Hadid, Zeboim and Neballat,
16011035 in Lod and Ono, and in Ge Harashim.
16011036 Some of the divisions of the Levites of Judah settled in Benjamin.
16012001 These were the priests and Levites who returned with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and with Joshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
16012002 Amariah, Malluk, Hattush,
16012003 Shekaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
16012004 Iddo, Ginnethon, Abijah,
16012005 Mijamin, Moadiah, Bilgah,
16012006 Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,
16012007 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah and Jedaiah. These were the leaders of the priests and their associates in the days of Joshua.
16012008 The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and also Mattaniah, who, together with his associates, was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving.
16012009 Bakbukiah and Unni, their associates, stood opposite them in the services.
16012010 Joshua was the father of Joiakim, Joiakim the father of Eliashib, Eliashib the father of Joiada,
16012011 Joiada the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan the father of Jaddua.
16012012 In the days of Joiakim, these were the heads of the priestly families: of Seraiah’s family, Meraiah; of Jeremiah’s, Hananiah;
16012013 of Ezra’s, Meshullam; of Amariah’s, Jehohanan;
16012014 of Malluk’s, Jonathan; of Shekaniah’s, Joseph;
16012015 of Harim’s, Adna; of Meremoth’s, Helkai;
16012016 of Iddo’s, Zechariah; of Ginnethon’s, Meshullam;
16012017 of Abijah’s, Zikri; of Miniamin’s and of Moadiah’s, Piltai;
16012018 of Bilgah’s, Shammua; of Shemaiah’s, Jehonathan;
16012019 of Joiarib’s, Mattenai; of Jedaiah’s, Uzzi;
16012020 of Sallu’s, Kallai; of Amok’s, Eber;
16012021 of Hilkiah’s, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah’s, Nethanel.
16012022 The family heads of the Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan and Jaddua, as well as those of the priests, were recorded in the reign of Darius the Persian.
16012023 The family heads among the descendants of Levi up to the time of Johanan son of Eliashib were recorded in the book of the annals.
16012024 And the leaders of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua son of Kadmiel, and their associates, who stood opposite them to give praise and thanksgiving, one section responding to the other, as prescribed by David the man of God.
16012025 Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon and Akkub were gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms at the gates.
16012026 They served in the days of Joiakim son of Joshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest, the teacher of the Law.
16012027 At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the Levites were sought out from where they lived and were brought to Jerusalem to celebrate joyfully the dedication with songs of thanksgiving and with the music of cymbals, harps and lyres.
16012028 The musicians also were brought together from the region around Jerusalem—from the villages of the Netophathites,
16012029 from Beth Gilgal, and from the area of Geba and Azmaveth, for the musicians had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem.
16012030 When the priests and Levites had purified themselves ceremonially, they purified the people, the gates and the wall.
16012031 I had the leaders of Judah go up on top of the wall. I also assigned two large choirs to give thanks. One was to proceed on top of the wall to the right, toward the Dung Gate.
16012032 Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed them,
16012033 along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,
16012034 Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,
16012035 as well as some priests with trumpets, and also Zechariah son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zakkur, the son of Asaph,
16012036 and his associates—Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah and Hanani—with musical instruments prescribed by David the man of God. Ezra the teacher of the Law led the procession.
16012037 At the Fountain Gate they continued directly up the steps of the City of David on the ascent to the wall and passed above the site of David’s palace to the Water Gate on the east.
16012038 The second choir proceeded in the opposite direction. I followed them on top of the wall, together with half the people—past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall,
16012039 over the Gate of Ephraim, the Jeshanah Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate. At the Gate of the Guard they stopped.
16012040 The two choirs that gave thanks then took their places in the house of God; so did I, together with half the officials,
16012041 as well as the priests—Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah and Hananiah with their trumpets—
16012042 and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam and Ezer. The choirs sang under the direction of Jezrahiah.
16012043 And on that day they offered great sacrifices, rejoicing because God had given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced. The sound of rejoicing in Jerusalem could be heard far away.
16012044 At that time men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the contributions, firstfruits and tithes. From the fields around the towns they were to bring into the storerooms the portions required by the Law for the priests and the Levites, for Judah was pleased with the ministering priests and Levites.
16012045 They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as did also the musicians and gatekeepers, according to the commands of David and his son Solomon.
16012046 For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there had been directors for the musicians and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
16012047 So in the days of Zerubbabel and of Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the daily portions for the musicians and the gatekeepers. They also set aside the portion for the other Levites, and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron.
16013001 On that day the Book of Moses was read aloud in the hearing of the people and there it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever be admitted into the assembly of God,
16013002 because they had not met the Israelites with food and water but had hired Balaam to call a curse down on them. (Our God, however, turned the curse into a blessing.)
16013003 When the people heard this law, they excluded from Israel all who were of foreign descent.
16013004 Before this, Eliashib the priest had been put in charge of the storerooms of the house of our God. He was closely associated with Tobiah,
16013005 and he had provided him with a large room formerly used to store the grain offerings and incense and temple articles, and also the tithes of grain, new wine and olive oil prescribed for the Levites, musicians and gatekeepers, as well as the contributions for the priests.
16013006 But while all this was going on, I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king. Some time later I asked his permission
16013007 and came back to Jerusalem. Here I learned about the evil thing Eliashib had done in providing Tobiah a room in the courts of the house of God.
16013008 I was greatly displeased and threw all Tobiah’s household goods out of the room.
16013009 I gave orders to purify the rooms, and then I put back into them the equipment of the house of God, with the grain offerings and the incense.
16013010 I also learned that the portions assigned to the Levites had not been given to them, and that all the Levites and musicians responsible for the service had gone back to their own fields.
16013011 So I rebuked the officials and asked them, “Why is the house of God neglected?” Then I called them together and stationed them at their posts.
16013012 All Judah brought the tithes of grain, new wine and olive oil into the storerooms.
16013013 I put Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and a Levite named Pedaiah in charge of the storerooms and made Hanan son of Zakkur, the son of Mattaniah, their assistant, because they were considered trustworthy. They were made responsible for distributing the supplies to their fellow Levites.
16013014 Remember me for this, my God, and do not blot out what I have so faithfully done for the house of my God and its services.
16013015 In those days I saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing in grain and loading it on donkeys, together with wine, grapes, figs and all other kinds of loads. And they were bringing all this into Jerusalem on the Sabbath. Therefore I warned them against selling food on that day.
16013016 People from Tyre who lived in Jerusalem were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them in Jerusalem on the Sabbath to the people of Judah.
16013017 I rebuked the nobles of Judah and said to them, “What is this wicked thing you are doing—desecrating the Sabbath day?
16013018 Didn’t your ancestors do the same things, so that our God brought all this calamity on us and on this city? Now you are stirring up more wrath against Israel by desecrating the Sabbath.”
16013019 When evening shadows fell on the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I ordered the doors to be shut and not opened until the Sabbath was over. I stationed some of my own men at the gates so that no load could be brought in on the Sabbath day.
16013020 Once or twice the merchants and sellers of all kinds of goods spent the night outside Jerusalem.
16013021 But I warned them and said, “Why do you spend the night by the wall? If you do this again, I will arrest you.” From that time on they no longer came on the Sabbath.
16013022 Then I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and go and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy. Remember me for this also, my God, and show mercy to me according to your great love.
16013023 Moreover, in those days I saw men of Judah who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon and Moab.
16013024 Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples, and did not know how to speak the language of Judah.
16013025 I rebuked them and called curses down on them. I beat some of the men and pulled out their hair. I made them take an oath in God’s name and said: “You are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons, nor are you to take their daughters in marriage for your sons or for yourselves.
16013026 Was it not because of marriages like these that Solomon king of Israel sinned? Among the many nations there was no king like him. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel, but even he was led into sin by foreign women.
16013027 Must we hear now that you too are doing all this terrible wickedness and are being unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women?”
16013028 One of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. And I drove him away from me.
16013029 Remember them, my God, because they defiled the priestly office and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.
16013030 So I purified the priests and the Levites of everything foreign, and assigned them duties, each to his own task.
16013031 I also made provision for contributions of wood at designated times, and for the firstfruits. Remember me with favor, my God.
17001001 This is what happened during the time of Xerxes, the Xerxes who ruled over 127 provinces stretching from India to Cush :
17001002 At that time King Xerxes reigned from his royal throne in the citadel of Susa,
17001003 and in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his nobles and officials. The military leaders of Persia and Media, the princes, and the nobles of the provinces were present.
17001004 For a full 180 days he displayed the vast wealth of his kingdom and the splendor and glory of his majesty.
17001005 When these days were over, the king gave a banquet, lasting seven days, in the enclosed garden of the king’s palace, for all the people from the least to the greatest who were in the citadel of Susa.
17001006 The garden had hangings of white and blue linen, fastened with cords of white linen and purple material to silver rings on marble pillars. There were couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and other costly stones.
17001007 Wine was served in goblets of gold, each one different from the other, and the royal wine was abundant, in keeping with the king’s liberality.
17001008 By the king’s command each guest was allowed to drink with no restrictions, for the king instructed all the wine stewards to serve each man what he wished.
17001009 Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes.
17001010 On the seventh day, when King Xerxes was in high spirits from wine, he commanded the seven eunuchs who served him—Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Karkas—
17001011 to bring before him Queen Vashti, wearing her royal crown, in order to display her beauty to the people and nobles, for she was lovely to look at.
17001012 But when the attendants delivered the king’s command, Queen Vashti refused to come. Then the king became furious and burned with anger.
17001013 Since it was customary for the king to consult experts in matters of law and justice, he spoke with the wise men who understood the times
17001014 and were closest to the king—Karshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memukan, the seven nobles of Persia and Media who had special access to the king and were highest in the kingdom.
17001015 “According to law, what must be done to Queen Vashti?” he asked. “She has not obeyed the command of King Xerxes that the eunuchs have taken to her.”
17001016 Then Memukan replied in the presence of the king and the nobles, “Queen Vashti has done wrong, not only against the king but also against all the nobles and the peoples of all the provinces of King Xerxes.
17001017 For the queen’s conduct will become known to all the women, and so they will despise their husbands and say, ‘King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she would not come.’
17001018 This very day the Persian and Median women of the nobility who have heard about the queen’s conduct will respond to all the king’s nobles in the same way. There will be no end of disrespect and discord.
17001019 “Therefore, if it pleases the king, let him issue a royal decree and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes. Also let the king give her royal position to someone else who is better than she.
17001020 Then when the king’s edict is proclaimed throughout all his vast realm, all the women will respect their husbands, from the least to the greatest.”
17001021 The king and his nobles were pleased with this advice, so the king did as Memukan proposed.
17001022 He sent dispatches to all parts of the kingdom, to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language, proclaiming that every man should be ruler over his own household, using his native tongue.
17002001 Later when King Xerxes’ fury had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what he had decreed about her.
17002002 Then the king’s personal attendants proposed, “Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king.
17002003 Let the king appoint commissioners in every province of his realm to bring all these beautiful young women into the harem at the citadel of Susa. Let them be placed under the care of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who is in charge of the women; and let beauty treatments be given to them.
17002004 Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” This advice appealed to the king, and he followed it.
17002005 Now there was in the citadel of Susa a Jew of the tribe of Benjamin, named Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish,
17002006 who had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, among those taken captive with Jehoiachin king of Judah.
17002007 Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah, whom he had brought up because she had neither father nor mother. This young woman, who was also known as Esther, had a lovely figure and was beautiful. Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter when her father and mother died.
17002008 When the king’s order and edict had been proclaimed, many young women were brought to the citadel of Susa and put under the care of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the king’s palace and entrusted to Hegai, who had charge of the harem.
17002009 She pleased him and won his favor. Immediately he provided her with her beauty treatments and special food. He assigned to her seven female attendants selected from the king’s palace and moved her and her attendants into the best place in the harem.
17002010 Esther had not revealed her nationality and family background, because Mordecai had forbidden her to do so.
17002011 Every day he walked back and forth near the courtyard of the harem to find out how Esther was and what was happening to her.
17002012 Before a young woman’s turn came to go in to King Xerxes, she had to complete twelve months of beauty treatments prescribed for the women, six months with oil of myrrh and six with perfumes and cosmetics.
17002013 And this is how she would go to the king: Anything she wanted was given her to take with her from the harem to the king’s palace.
17002014 In the evening she would go there and in the morning return to another part of the harem to the care of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not return to the king unless he was pleased with her and summoned her by name.
17002015 When the turn came for Esther (the young woman Mordecai had adopted, the daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go to the king, she asked for nothing other than what Hegai, the king’s eunuch who was in charge of the harem, suggested. And Esther won the favor of everyone who saw her.
17002016 She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal residence in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
17002017 Now the king was attracted to Esther more than to any of the other women, and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins. So he set a royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.
17002018 And the king gave a great banquet, Esther’s banquet, for all his nobles and officials. He proclaimed a holiday throughout the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality.
17002019 When the virgins were assembled a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate.
17002020 But Esther had kept secret her family background and nationality just as Mordecai had told her to do, for she continued to follow Mordecai’s instructions as she had done when he was bringing her up.
17002021 During the time Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s officers who guarded the doorway, became angry and conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.
17002022 But Mordecai found out about the plot and told Queen Esther, who in turn reported it to the king, giving credit to Mordecai.
17002023 And when the report was investigated and found to be true, the two officials were impaled on poles. All this was recorded in the book of the annals in the presence of the king.
17003001 After these events, King Xerxes honored Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, elevating him and giving him a seat of honor higher than that of all the other nobles.
17003002 All the royal officials at the king’s gate knelt down and paid honor to Haman, for the king had commanded this concerning him. But Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor.
17003003 Then the royal officials at the king’s gate asked Mordecai, “Why do you disobey the king’s command?”
17003004 Day after day they spoke to him but he refused to comply. Therefore they told Haman about it to see whether Mordecai’s behavior would be tolerated, for he had told them he was a Jew.
17003005 When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor, he was enraged.
17003006 Yet having learned who Mordecai’s people were, he scorned the idea of killing only Mordecai. Instead Haman looked for a way to destroy all Mordecai’s people, the Jews, throughout the whole kingdom of Xerxes.
17003007 In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, in the first month, the month of Nisan, the pur (that is, the lot) was cast in the presence of Haman to select a day and month. And the lot fell on the twelfth month, the month of Adar.
17003008 Then Haman said to King Xerxes, “There is a certain people dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom who keep themselves separate. Their customs are different from those of all other people, and they do not obey the king’s laws; it is not in the king’s best interest to tolerate them.
17003009 If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued to destroy them, and I will give ten thousand talents of silver to the king’s administrators for the royal treasury.”
17003010 So the king took his signet ring from his finger and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.
17003011 “Keep the money,” the king said to Haman, “and do with the people as you please.”
17003012 Then on the thirteenth day of the first month the royal secretaries were summoned. They wrote out in the script of each province and in the language of each people all Haman’s orders to the king’s satraps, the governors of the various provinces and the nobles of the various peoples. These were written in the name of King Xerxes himself and sealed with his own ring.
17003013 Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces with the order to destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews—young and old, women and children—on a single day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods.
17003014 A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so they would be ready for that day.
17003015 The couriers went out, spurred on by the king’s command, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was bewildered.
17004001 When Mordecai learned of all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the city, wailing loudly and bitterly.
17004002 But he went only as far as the king’s gate, because no one clothed in sackcloth was allowed to enter it.
17004003 In every province to which the edict and order of the king came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping and wailing. Many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
17004004 When Esther’s eunuchs and female attendants came and told her about Mordecai, she was in great distress. She sent clothes for him to put on instead of his sackcloth, but he would not accept them.
17004005 Then Esther summoned Hathak, one of the king’s eunuchs assigned to attend her, and ordered him to find out what was troubling Mordecai and why.
17004006 So Hathak went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king’s gate.
17004007 Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him, including the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews.
17004008 He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict for their annihilation, which had been published in Susa, to show to Esther and explain it to her, and he told him to instruct her to go into the king’s presence to beg for mercy and plead with him for her people.
17004009 Hathak went back and reported to Esther what Mordecai had said.
17004010 Then she instructed him to say to Mordecai,
17004011 “All the king’s officials and the people of the royal provinces know that for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned the king has but one law: that they be put to death unless the king extends the gold scepter to them and spares their lives. But thirty days have passed since I was called to go to the king.”
17004012 When Esther’s words were reported to Mordecai,
17004013 he sent back this answer: “Do not think that because you are in the king’s house you alone of all the Jews will escape.
17004014 For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father’s family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?”
17004015 Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai:
17004016 “Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my attendants will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish.”
17004017 So Mordecai went away and carried out all of Esther’s instructions.
17005001 On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the palace, in front of the king’s hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the hall, facing the entrance.
17005002 When he saw Queen Esther standing in the court, he was pleased with her and held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter.
17005003 Then the king asked, “What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be given you.”
17005004 “If it pleases the king,” replied Esther, “let the king, together with Haman, come today to a banquet I have prepared for him.”
17005005 “Bring Haman at once,” the king said, “so that we may do what Esther asks.” So the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared.
17005006 As they were drinking wine, the king again asked Esther, “Now what is your petition? It will be given you. And what is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be granted.”
17005007 Esther replied, “My petition and my request is this:
17005008 If the king regards me with favor and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet I will prepare for them. Then I will answer the king’s question.”
17005009 Haman went out that day happy and in high spirits. But when he saw Mordecai at the king’s gate and observed that he neither rose nor showed fear in his presence, he was filled with rage against Mordecai.
17005010 Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went home. Calling together his friends and Zeresh, his wife,
17005011 Haman boasted to them about his vast wealth, his many sons, and all the ways the king had honored him and how he had elevated him above the other nobles and officials.
17005012 “And that’s not all,” Haman added. “I’m the only person Queen Esther invited to accompany the king to the banquet she gave. And she has invited me along with the king tomorrow.
17005013 But all this gives me no satisfaction as long as I see that Jew Mordecai sitting at the king’s gate.”
17005014 His wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, “Have a pole set up, reaching to a height of fifty cubits, and ask the king in the morning to have Mordecai impaled on it. Then go with the king to the banquet and enjoy yourself.” This suggestion delighted Haman, and he had the pole set up.
17006001 That night the king could not sleep; so he ordered the book of the chronicles, the record of his reign, to be brought in and read to him.
17006002 It was found recorded there that Mordecai had exposed Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s officers who guarded the doorway, who had conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.
17006003 “What honor and recognition has Mordecai received for this?” the king asked. “Nothing has been done for him,” his attendants answered.
17006004 The king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the palace to speak to the king about impaling Mordecai on the pole he had set up for him.
17006005 His attendants answered, “Haman is standing in the court.” “Bring him in,” the king ordered.
17006006 When Haman entered, the king asked him, “What should be done for the man the king delights to honor?” Now Haman thought to himself, “Who is there that the king would rather honor than me?”
17006007 So he answered the king, “For the man the king delights to honor,
17006008 have them bring a royal robe the king has worn and a horse the king has ridden, one with a royal crest placed on its head.
17006009 Then let the robe and horse be entrusted to one of the king’s most noble princes. Let them robe the man the king delights to honor, and lead him on the horse through the city streets, proclaiming before him, ‘This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!’ ”
17006010 “Go at once,” the king commanded Haman. “Get the robe and the horse and do just as you have suggested for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king’s gate. Do not neglect anything you have recommended.”
17006011 So Haman got the robe and the horse. He robed Mordecai, and led him on horseback through the city streets, proclaiming before him, “This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!”
17006012 Afterward Mordecai returned to the king’s gate. But Haman rushed home, with his head covered in grief,
17006013 and told Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. His advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him, “Since Mordecai, before whom your downfall has started, is of Jewish origin, you cannot stand against him—you will surely come to ruin!”
17006014 While they were still talking with him, the king’s eunuchs arrived and hurried Haman away to the banquet Esther had prepared.
17007001 So the king and Haman went to Queen Esther’s banquet,
17007002 and as they were drinking wine on the second day, the king again asked, “Queen Esther, what is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be granted.”
17007003 Then Queen Esther answered, “If I have found favor with you, Your Majesty, and if it pleases you, grant me my life—this is my petition. And spare my people—this is my request.
17007004 For I and my people have been sold to be destroyed, killed and annihilated. If we had merely been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept quiet, because no such distress would justify disturbing the king. ”
17007005 King Xerxes asked Queen Esther, “Who is he? Where is he—the man who has dared to do such a thing?”
17007006 Esther said, “An adversary and enemy! This vile Haman!” Then Haman was terrified before the king and queen.
17007007 The king got up in a rage, left his wine and went out into the palace garden. But Haman, realizing that the king had already decided his fate, stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life.
17007008 Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining. The king exclaimed, “Will he even molest the queen while she is with me in the house?” As soon as the word left the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.
17007009 Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs attending the king, said, “A pole reaching to a height of fifty cubits stands by Haman’s house. He had it set up for Mordecai, who spoke up to help the king.” The king said, “Impale him on it!”
17007010 So they impaled Haman on the pole he had set up for Mordecai. Then the king’s fury subsided.
17008001 That same day King Xerxes gave Queen Esther the estate of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came into the presence of the king, for Esther had told how he was related to her.
17008002 The king took off his signet ring, which he had reclaimed from Haman, and presented it to Mordecai. And Esther appointed him over Haman’s estate.
17008003 Esther again pleaded with the king, falling at his feet and weeping. She begged him to put an end to the evil plan of Haman the Agagite, which he had devised against the Jews.
17008004 Then the king extended the gold scepter to Esther and she arose and stood before him.
17008005 “If it pleases the king,” she said, “and if he regards me with favor and thinks it the right thing to do, and if he is pleased with me, let an order be written overruling the dispatches that Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, devised and wrote to destroy the Jews in all the king’s provinces.
17008006 For how can I bear to see disaster fall on my people? How can I bear to see the destruction of my family?”
17008007 King Xerxes replied to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Because Haman attacked the Jews, I have given his estate to Esther, and they have impaled him on the pole he set up.
17008008 Now write another decree in the king’s name in behalf of the Jews as seems best to you, and seal it with the king’s signet ring—for no document written in the king’s name and sealed with his ring can be revoked.”
17008009 At once the royal secretaries were summoned—on the twenty-third day of the third month, the month of Sivan. They wrote out all Mordecai’s orders to the Jews, and to the satraps, governors and nobles of the 127 provinces stretching from India to Cush. These orders were written in the script of each province and the language of each people and also to the Jews in their own script and language.
17008010 Mordecai wrote in the name of King Xerxes, sealed the dispatches with the king’s signet ring, and sent them by mounted couriers, who rode fast horses especially bred for the king.
17008011 The king’s edict granted the Jews in every city the right to assemble and protect themselves; to destroy, kill and annihilate the armed men of any nationality or province who might attack them and their women and children, and to plunder the property of their enemies.
17008012 The day appointed for the Jews to do this in all the provinces of King Xerxes was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar.
17008013 A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
17008014 The couriers, riding the royal horses, went out, spurred on by the king’s command, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa.
17008015 When Mordecai left the king’s presence, he was wearing royal garments of blue and white, a large crown of gold and a purple robe of fine linen. And the city of Susa held a joyous celebration.
17008016 For the Jews it was a time of happiness and joy, gladness and honor.
17008017 In every province and in every city to which the edict of the king came, there was joy and gladness among the Jews, with feasting and celebrating. And many people of other nationalities became Jews because fear of the Jews had seized them.
17009001 On the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, the edict commanded by the king was to be carried out. On this day the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, but now the tables were turned and the Jews got the upper hand over those who hated them.
17009002 The Jews assembled in their cities in all the provinces of King Xerxes to attack those determined to destroy them. No one could stand against them, because the people of all the other nationalities were afraid of them.
17009003 And all the nobles of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and the king’s administrators helped the Jews, because fear of Mordecai had seized them.
17009004 Mordecai was prominent in the palace; his reputation spread throughout the provinces, and he became more and more powerful.
17009005 The Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them, and they did what they pleased to those who hated them.
17009006 In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.
17009007 They also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
17009008 Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
17009009 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai and Vaizatha,
17009010 the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But they did not lay their hands on the plunder.
17009011 The number of those killed in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king that same day.
17009012 The king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman in the citadel of Susa. What have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? Now what is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request? It will also be granted.”
17009013 “If it pleases the king,” Esther answered, “give the Jews in Susa permission to carry out this day’s edict tomorrow also, and let Haman’s ten sons be impaled on poles.”
17009014 So the king commanded that this be done. An edict was issued in Susa, and they impaled the ten sons of Haman.
17009015 The Jews in Susa came together on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and they put to death in Susa three hundred men, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.
17009016 Meanwhile, the remainder of the Jews who were in the king’s provinces also assembled to protect themselves and get relief from their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand of them but did not lay their hands on the plunder.
17009017 This happened on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy.
17009018 The Jews in Susa, however, had assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth, and then on the fifteenth they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy.
17009019 That is why rural Jews—those living in villages—observe the fourteenth of the month of Adar as a day of joy and feasting, a day for giving presents to each other.
17009020 Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews throughout the provinces of King Xerxes, near and far,
17009021 to have them celebrate annually the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar
17009022 as the time when the Jews got relief from their enemies, and as the month when their sorrow was turned into joy and their mourning into a day of celebration. He wrote them to observe the days as days of feasting and joy and giving presents of food to one another and gifts to the poor.
17009023 So the Jews agreed to continue the celebration they had begun, doing what Mordecai had written to them.
17009024 For Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them and had cast the pur (that is, the lot) for their ruin and destruction.
17009025 But when the plot came to the king’s attention, he issued written orders that the evil scheme Haman had devised against the Jews should come back onto his own head, and that he and his sons should be impaled on poles.
17009026 (Therefore these days were called Purim, from the word pur.) Because of everything written in this letter and because of what they had seen and what had happened to them,
17009027 the Jews took it on themselves to establish the custom that they and their descendants and all who join them should without fail observe these two days every year, in the way prescribed and at the time appointed.
17009028 These days should be remembered and observed in every generation by every family, and in every province and in every city. And these days of Purim should never fail to be celebrated by the Jews—nor should the memory of these days die out among their descendants.
17009029 So Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter concerning Purim.
17009030 And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in the 127 provinces of Xerxes’ kingdom—words of goodwill and assurance—
17009031 to establish these days of Purim at their designated times, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had decreed for them, and as they had established for themselves and their descendants in regard to their times of fasting and lamentation.
17009032 Esther’s decree confirmed these regulations about Purim, and it was written down in the records.
17010001 King Xerxes imposed tribute throughout the empire, to its distant shores.
17010002 And all his acts of power and might, together with a full account of the greatness of Mordecai, whom the king had promoted, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Media and Persia?
17010003 Mordecai the Jew was second in rank to King Xerxes, preeminent among the Jews, and held in high esteem by his many fellow Jews, because he worked for the good of his people and spoke up for the welfare of all the Jews.
18001001 In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil.
18001002 He had seven sons and three daughters,
18001003 and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.
18001004 His sons used to hold feasts in their homes on their birthdays, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
18001005 When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would make arrangements for them to be purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular custom.
18001006 One day the angels came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came with them.
18001007 The Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the Lord, “From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.”
18001008 Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.”
18001009 “Does Job fear God for nothing?” Satan replied.
18001010 “Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.
18001011 But now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.”
18001012 The Lord said to Satan, “Very well, then, everything he has is in your power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.” Then Satan went out from the presence of the Lord.
18001013 One day when Job’s sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house,
18001014 a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,
18001015 and the Sabeans attacked and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”
18001016 While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “The fire of God fell from the heavens and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”
18001017 While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”
18001018 While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, “Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house,
18001019 when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”
18001020 At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship
18001021 and said: “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will depart. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; may the name of the Lord be praised.”
18001022 In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.
18002001 On another day the angels came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came with them to present himself before him.
18002002 And the Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the Lord, “From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.”
18002003 Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason.”
18002004 “Skin for skin!” Satan replied. “A man will give all he has for his own life.
18002005 But now stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face.”
18002006 The Lord said to Satan, “Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life.”
18002007 So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head.
18002008 Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.
18002009 His wife said to him, “Are you still maintaining your integrity? Curse God and die!”
18002010 He replied, “You are talking like a foolish woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?” In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.
18002011 When Job’s three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him.
18002012 When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.
18002013 Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.
18003001 After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
18003002 He said:
18003003 “May the day of my birth perish, and the night that said, ‘A boy is conceived!’
18003004 That day—may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine on it.
18003005 May gloom and utter darkness claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm it.
18003006 That night—may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.
18003007 May that night be barren; may no shout of joy be heard in it.
18003008 May those who curse days curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.
18003009 May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn,
18003010 for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes.
18003011 “Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?
18003012 Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed?
18003013 For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest
18003014 with kings and rulers of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins,
18003015 with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
18003016 Or why was I not hidden away in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?
18003017 There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.
18003018 Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver’s shout.
18003019 The small and the great are there, and the slaves are freed from their owners.
18003020 “Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,
18003021 to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure,
18003022 who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave?
18003023 Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?
18003024 For sighing has become my daily food; my groans pour out like water.
18003025 What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me.
18003026 I have no peace, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil.”
18004001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
18004002 “If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? But who can keep from speaking?
18004003 Think how you have instructed many, how you have strengthened feeble hands.
18004004 Your words have supported those who stumbled; you have strengthened faltering knees.
18004005 But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged; it strikes you, and you are dismayed.
18004006 Should not your piety be your confidence and your blameless ways your hope?
18004007 “Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Where were the upright ever destroyed?
18004008 As I have observed, those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it.
18004009 At the breath of God they perish; at the blast of his anger they are no more.
18004010 The lions may roar and growl, yet the teeth of the great lions are broken.
18004011 The lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
18004012 “A word was secretly brought to me, my ears caught a whisper of it.
18004013 Amid disquieting dreams in the night, when deep sleep falls on people,
18004014 fear and trembling seized me and made all my bones shake.
18004015 A spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body stood on end.
18004016 It stopped, but I could not tell what it was. A form stood before my eyes, and I heard a hushed voice:
18004017 ‘Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can even a strong man be more pure than his Maker?
18004018 If God places no trust in his servants, if he charges his angels with error,
18004019 how much more those who live in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who are crushed more readily than a moth!
18004020 Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces; unnoticed, they perish forever.
18004021 Are not the cords of their tent pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?’
18005001 “Call if you will, but who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?
18005002 Resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple.
18005003 I myself have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly his house was cursed.
18005004 His children are far from safety, crushed in court without a defender.
18005005 The hungry consume his harvest, taking it even from among thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.
18005006 For hardship does not spring from the soil, nor does trouble sprout from the ground.
18005007 Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward.
18005008 “But if I were you, I would appeal to God; I would lay my cause before him.
18005009 He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.
18005010 He provides rain for the earth; he sends water on the countryside.
18005011 The lowly he sets on high, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.
18005012 He thwarts the plans of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success.
18005013 He catches the wise in their craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are swept away.
18005014 Darkness comes upon them in the daytime; at noon they grope as in the night.
18005015 He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth; he saves them from the clutches of the powerful.
18005016 So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth.
18005017 “Blessed is the one whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
18005018 For he wounds, but he also binds up; he injures, but his hands also heal.
18005019 From six calamities he will rescue you; in seven no harm will touch you.
18005020 In famine he will deliver you from death, and in battle from the stroke of the sword.
18005021 You will be protected from the lash of the tongue, and need not fear when destruction comes.
18005022 You will laugh at destruction and famine, and need not fear the wild animals.
18005023 For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
18005024 You will know that your tent is secure; you will take stock of your property and find nothing missing.
18005025 You will know that your children will be many, and your descendants like the grass of the earth.
18005026 You will come to the grave in full vigor, like sheaves gathered in season.
18005027 “We have examined this, and it is true. So hear it and apply it to yourself.”
18006001 Then Job replied:
18006002 “If only my anguish could be weighed and all my misery be placed on the scales!
18006003 It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas— no wonder my words have been impetuous.
18006004 The arrows of the Almighty are in me, my spirit drinks in their poison; God’s terrors are marshaled against me.
18006005 Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass, or an ox bellow when it has fodder?
18006006 Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there flavor in the sap of the mallow ?
18006007 I refuse to touch it; such food makes me ill.
18006008 “Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant what I hope for,
18006009 that God would be willing to crush me, to let loose his hand and cut off my life!
18006010 Then I would still have this consolation— my joy in unrelenting pain— that I had not denied the words of the Holy One.
18006011 “What strength do I have, that I should still hope? What prospects, that I should be patient?
18006012 Do I have the strength of stone? Is my flesh bronze?
18006013 Do I have any power to help myself, now that success has been driven from me?
18006014 “Anyone who withholds kindness from a friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
18006015 But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams, as the streams that overflow
18006016 when darkened by thawing ice and swollen with melting snow,
18006017 but that stop flowing in the dry season, and in the heat vanish from their channels.
18006018 Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go off into the wasteland and perish.
18006019 The caravans of Tema look for water, the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope.
18006020 They are distressed, because they had been confident; they arrive there, only to be disappointed.
18006021 Now you too have proved to be of no help; you see something dreadful and are afraid.
18006022 Have I ever said, ‘Give something on my behalf, pay a ransom for me from your wealth,
18006023 deliver me from the hand of the enemy, rescue me from the clutches of the ruthless’?
18006024 “Teach me, and I will be quiet; show me where I have been wrong.
18006025 How painful are honest words! But what do your arguments prove?
18006026 Do you mean to correct what I say, and treat my desperate words as wind?
18006027 You would even cast lots for the fatherless and barter away your friend.
18006028 “But now be so kind as to look at me. Would I lie to your face?
18006029 Relent, do not be unjust; reconsider, for my integrity is at stake.
18006030 Is there any wickedness on my lips? Can my mouth not discern malice?
18007001 “Do not mortals have hard service on earth? Are not their days like those of hired laborers?
18007002 Like a slave longing for the evening shadows, or a hired laborer waiting to be paid,
18007003 so I have been allotted months of futility, and nights of misery have been assigned to me.
18007004 When I lie down I think, ‘How long before I get up?’ The night drags on, and I toss and turn until dawn.
18007005 My body is clothed with worms and scabs, my skin is broken and festering.
18007006 “My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and they come to an end without hope.
18007007 Remember, O God, that my life is but a breath; my eyes will never see happiness again.
18007008 The eye that now sees me will see me no longer; you will look for me, but I will be no more.
18007009 As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so one who goes down to the grave does not return.
18007010 He will never come to his house again; his place will know him no more.
18007011 “Therefore I will not keep silent; I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
18007012 Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep, that you put me under guard?
18007013 When I think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint,
18007014 even then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions,
18007015 so that I prefer strangling and death, rather than this body of mine.
18007016 I despise my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone; my days have no meaning.
18007017 “What is mankind that you make so much of them, that you give them so much attention,
18007018 that you examine them every morning and test them every moment?
18007019 Will you never look away from me, or let me alone even for an instant?
18007020 If I have sinned, what have I done to you, you who see everything we do? Why have you made me your target? Have I become a burden to you?
18007021 Why do you not pardon my offenses and forgive my sins? For I will soon lie down in the dust; you will search for me, but I will be no more.”
18008001 Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
18008002 “How long will you say such things? Your words are a blustering wind.
18008003 Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?
18008004 When your children sinned against him, he gave them over to the penalty of their sin.
18008005 But if you will seek God earnestly and plead with the Almighty,
18008006 if you are pure and upright, even now he will rouse himself on your behalf and restore you to your prosperous state.
18008007 Your beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous will your future be.
18008008 “Ask the former generation and find out what their ancestors learned,
18008009 for we were born only yesterday and know nothing, and our days on earth are but a shadow.
18008010 Will they not instruct you and tell you? Will they not bring forth words from their understanding?
18008011 Can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh? Can reeds thrive without water?
18008012 While still growing and uncut, they wither more quickly than grass.
18008013 Such is the destiny of all who forget God; so perishes the hope of the godless.
18008014 What they trust in is fragile ; what they rely on is a spider’s web.
18008015 They lean on the web, but it gives way; they cling to it, but it does not hold.
18008016 They are like a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden;
18008017 it entwines its roots around a pile of rocks and looks for a place among the stones.
18008018 But when it is torn from its spot, that place disowns it and says, ‘I never saw you.’
18008019 Surely its life withers away, and from the soil other plants grow.
18008020 “Surely God does not reject one who is blameless or strengthen the hands of evildoers.
18008021 He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy.
18008022 Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tents of the wicked will be no more.”
18009001 Then Job replied:
18009002 “Indeed, I know that this is true. But how can mere mortals prove their innocence before God?
18009003 Though they wished to dispute with him, they could not answer him one time out of a thousand.
18009004 His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?
18009005 He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger.
18009006 He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble.
18009007 He speaks to the sun and it does not shine; he seals off the light of the stars.
18009008 He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.
18009009 He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.
18009010 He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.
18009011 When he passes me, I cannot see him; when he goes by, I cannot perceive him.
18009012 If he snatches away, who can stop him? Who can say to him, ‘What are you doing?’
18009013 God does not restrain his anger; even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet.
18009014 “How then can I dispute with him? How can I find words to argue with him?
18009015 Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my Judge for mercy.
18009016 Even if I summoned him and he responded, I do not believe he would give me a hearing.
18009017 He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason.
18009018 He would not let me catch my breath but would overwhelm me with misery.
18009019 If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty! And if it is a matter of justice, who can challenge him ?
18009020 Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty.
18009021 “Although I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life.
18009022 It is all the same; that is why I say, ‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’
18009023 When a scourge brings sudden death, he mocks the despair of the innocent.
18009024 When a land falls into the hands of the wicked, he blindfolds its judges. If it is not he, then who is it?
18009025 “My days are swifter than a runner; they fly away without a glimpse of joy.
18009026 They skim past like boats of papyrus, like eagles swooping down on their prey.
18009027 If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression, and smile,’
18009028 I still dread all my sufferings, for I know you will not hold me innocent.
18009029 Since I am already found guilty, why should I struggle in vain?
18009030 Even if I washed myself with soap and my hands with cleansing powder,
18009031 you would plunge me into a slime pit so that even my clothes would detest me.
18009032 “He is not a mere mortal like me that I might answer him, that we might confront each other in court.
18009033 If only there were someone to mediate between us, someone to bring us together,
18009034 someone to remove God’s rod from me, so that his terror would frighten me no more.
18009035 Then I would speak up without fear of him, but as it now stands with me, I cannot.
18010001 “I loathe my very life; therefore I will give free rein to my complaint and speak out in the bitterness of my soul.
18010002 I say to God: Do not declare me guilty, but tell me what charges you have against me.
18010003 Does it please you to oppress me, to spurn the work of your hands, while you smile on the plans of the wicked?
18010004 Do you have eyes of flesh? Do you see as a mortal sees?
18010005 Are your days like those of a mortal or your years like those of a strong man,
18010006 that you must search out my faults and probe after my sin—
18010007 though you know that I am not guilty and that no one can rescue me from your hand?
18010008 “Your hands shaped me and made me. Will you now turn and destroy me?
18010009 Remember that you molded me like clay. Will you now turn me to dust again?
18010010 Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese,
18010011 clothe me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews?
18010012 You gave me life and showed me kindness, and in your providence watched over my spirit.
18010013 “But this is what you concealed in your heart, and I know that this was in your mind:
18010014 If I sinned, you would be watching me and would not let my offense go unpunished.
18010015 If I am guilty—woe to me! Even if I am innocent, I cannot lift my head, for I am full of shame and drowned in my affliction.
18010016 If I hold my head high, you stalk me like a lion and again display your awesome power against me.
18010017 You bring new witnesses against me and increase your anger toward me; your forces come against me wave upon wave.
18010018 “Why then did you bring me out of the womb? I wish I had died before any eye saw me.
18010019 If only I had never come into being, or had been carried straight from the womb to the grave!
18010020 Are not my few days almost over? Turn away from me so I can have a moment’s joy
18010021 before I go to the place of no return, to the land of gloom and utter darkness,
18010022 to the land of deepest night, of utter darkness and disorder, where even the light is like darkness.”
18011001 Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
18011002 “Are all these words to go unanswered? Is this talker to be vindicated?
18011003 Will your idle talk reduce others to silence? Will no one rebuke you when you mock?
18011004 You say to God, ‘My beliefs are flawless and I am pure in your sight.’
18011005 Oh, how I wish that God would speak, that he would open his lips against you
18011006 and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know this: God has even forgotten some of your sin.
18011007 “Can you fathom the mysteries of God? Can you probe the limits of the Almighty?
18011008 They are higher than the heavens above—what can you do? They are deeper than the depths below—what can you know?
18011009 Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.
18011010 “If he comes along and confines you in prison and convenes a court, who can oppose him?
18011011 Surely he recognizes deceivers; and when he sees evil, does he not take note?
18011012 But the witless can no more become wise than a wild donkey’s colt can be born human.
18011013 “Yet if you devote your heart to him and stretch out your hands to him,
18011014 if you put away the sin that is in your hand and allow no evil to dwell in your tent,
18011015 then, free of fault, you will lift up your face; you will stand firm and without fear.
18011016 You will surely forget your trouble, recalling it only as waters gone by.
18011017 Life will be brighter than noonday, and darkness will become like morning.
18011018 You will be secure, because there is hope; you will look about you and take your rest in safety.
18011019 You will lie down, with no one to make you afraid, and many will court your favor.
18011020 But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and escape will elude them; their hope will become a dying gasp.”
18012001 Then Job replied:
18012002 “Doubtless you are the only people who matter, and wisdom will die with you!
18012003 But I have a mind as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know all these things?
18012004 “I have become a laughingstock to my friends, though I called on God and he answered— a mere laughingstock, though righteous and blameless!
18012005 Those who are at ease have contempt for misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.
18012006 The tents of marauders are undisturbed, and those who provoke God are secure— those God has in his hand.
18012007 “But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds in the sky, and they will tell you;
18012008 or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish in the sea inform you.
18012009 Which of all these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done this?
18012010 In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.
18012011 Does not the ear test words as the tongue tastes food?
18012012 Is not wisdom found among the aged? Does not long life bring understanding?
18012013 “To God belong wisdom and power; counsel and understanding are his.
18012014 What he tears down cannot be rebuilt; those he imprisons cannot be released.
18012015 If he holds back the waters, there is drought; if he lets them loose, they devastate the land.
18012016 To him belong strength and insight; both deceived and deceiver are his.
18012017 He leads rulers away stripped and makes fools of judges.
18012018 He takes off the shackles put on by kings and ties a loincloth around their waist.
18012019 He leads priests away stripped and overthrows officials long established.
18012020 He silences the lips of trusted advisers and takes away the discernment of elders.
18012021 He pours contempt on nobles and disarms the mighty.
18012022 He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings utter darkness into the light.
18012023 He makes nations great, and destroys them; he enlarges nations, and disperses them.
18012024 He deprives the leaders of the earth of their reason; he makes them wander in a trackless waste.
18012025 They grope in darkness with no light; he makes them stagger like drunkards.
18013001 “My eyes have seen all this, my ears have heard and understood it.
18013002 What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.
18013003 But I desire to speak to the Almighty and to argue my case with God.
18013004 You, however, smear me with lies; you are worthless physicians, all of you!
18013005 If only you would be altogether silent! For you, that would be wisdom.
18013006 Hear now my argument; listen to the pleas of my lips.
18013007 Will you speak wickedly on God’s behalf? Will you speak deceitfully for him?
18013008 Will you show him partiality? Will you argue the case for God?
18013009 Would it turn out well if he examined you? Could you deceive him as you might deceive a mortal?
18013010 He would surely call you to account if you secretly showed partiality.
18013011 Would not his splendor terrify you? Would not the dread of him fall on you?
18013012 Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay.
18013013 “Keep silent and let me speak; then let come to me what may.
18013014 Why do I put myself in jeopardy and take my life in my hands?
18013015 Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him; I will surely defend my ways to his face.
18013016 Indeed, this will turn out for my deliverance, for no godless person would dare come before him!
18013017 Listen carefully to what I say; let my words ring in your ears.
18013018 Now that I have prepared my case, I know I will be vindicated.
18013019 Can anyone bring charges against me? If so, I will be silent and die.
18013020 “Only grant me these two things, God, and then I will not hide from you:
18013021 Withdraw your hand far from me, and stop frightening me with your terrors.
18013022 Then summon me and I will answer, or let me speak, and you reply to me.
18013023 How many wrongs and sins have I committed? Show me my offense and my sin.
18013024 Why do you hide your face and consider me your enemy?
18013025 Will you torment a windblown leaf? Will you chase after dry chaff?
18013026 For you write down bitter things against me and make me reap the sins of my youth.
18013027 You fasten my feet in shackles; you keep close watch on all my paths by putting marks on the soles of my feet.
18013028 “So man wastes away like something rotten, like a garment eaten by moths.
18014001 “Mortals, born of woman, are of few days and full of trouble.
18014002 They spring up like flowers and wither away; like fleeting shadows, they do not endure.
18014003 Do you fix your eye on them? Will you bring them before you for judgment?
18014004 Who can bring what is pure from the impure? No one!
18014005 A person’s days are determined; you have decreed the number of his months and have set limits he cannot exceed.
18014006 So look away from him and let him alone, till he has put in his time like a hired laborer.
18014007 “At least there is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its new shoots will not fail.
18014008 Its roots may grow old in the ground and its stump die in the soil,
18014009 yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth shoots like a plant.
18014010 But a man dies and is laid low; he breathes his last and is no more.
18014011 As the water of a lake dries up or a riverbed becomes parched and dry,
18014012 so he lies down and does not rise; till the heavens are no more, people will not awake or be roused from their sleep.
18014013 “If only you would hide me in the grave and conceal me till your anger has passed! If only you would set me a time and then remember me!
18014014 If someone dies, will they live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait for my renewal to come.
18014015 You will call and I will answer you; you will long for the creature your hands have made.
18014016 Surely then you will count my steps but not keep track of my sin.
18014017 My offenses will be sealed up in a bag; you will cover over my sin.
18014018 “But as a mountain erodes and crumbles and as a rock is moved from its place,
18014019 as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil, so you destroy a person’s hope.
18014020 You overpower them once for all, and they are gone; you change their countenance and send them away.
18014021 If their children are honored, they do not know it; if their offspring are brought low, they do not see it.
18014022 They feel but the pain of their own bodies and mourn only for themselves.”
18015001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
18015002 “Would a wise person answer with empty notions or fill their belly with the hot east wind?
18015003 Would they argue with useless words, with speeches that have no value?
18015004 But you even undermine piety and hinder devotion to God.
18015005 Your sin prompts your mouth; you adopt the tongue of the crafty.
18015006 Your own mouth condemns you, not mine; your own lips testify against you.
18015007 “Are you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?
18015008 Do you listen in on God’s council? Do you have a monopoly on wisdom?
18015009 What do you know that we do not know? What insights do you have that we do not have?
18015010 The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, men even older than your father.
18015011 Are God’s consolations not enough for you, words spoken gently to you?
18015012 Why has your heart carried you away, and why do your eyes flash,
18015013 so that you vent your rage against God and pour out such words from your mouth?
18015014 “What are mortals, that they could be pure, or those born of woman, that they could be righteous?
18015015 If God places no trust in his holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes,
18015016 how much less mortals, who are vile and corrupt, who drink up evil like water!
18015017 “Listen to me and I will explain to you; let me tell you what I have seen,
18015018 what the wise have declared, hiding nothing received from their ancestors
18015019 (to whom alone the land was given when no foreigners moved among them):
18015020 All his days the wicked man suffers torment, the ruthless man through all the years stored up for him.
18015021 Terrifying sounds fill his ears; when all seems well, marauders attack him.
18015022 He despairs of escaping the realm of darkness; he is marked for the sword.
18015023 He wanders about for food like a vulture; he knows the day of darkness is at hand.
18015024 Distress and anguish fill him with terror; troubles overwhelm him, like a king poised to attack,
18015025 because he shakes his fist at God and vaunts himself against the Almighty,
18015026 defiantly charging against him with a thick, strong shield.
18015027 “Though his face is covered with fat and his waist bulges with flesh,
18015028 he will inhabit ruined towns and houses where no one lives, houses crumbling to rubble.
18015029 He will no longer be rich and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the land.
18015030 He will not escape the darkness; a flame will wither his shoots, and the breath of God’s mouth will carry him away.
18015031 Let him not deceive himself by trusting what is worthless, for he will get nothing in return.
18015032 Before his time he will wither, and his branches will not flourish.
18015033 He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, like an olive tree shedding its blossoms.
18015034 For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of those who love bribes.
18015035 They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb fashions deceit.”
18016001 Then Job replied:
18016002 “I have heard many things like these; you are miserable comforters, all of you!
18016003 Will your long-winded speeches never end? What ails you that you keep on arguing?
18016004 I also could speak like you, if you were in my place; I could make fine speeches against you and shake my head at you.
18016005 But my mouth would encourage you; comfort from my lips would bring you relief.
18016006 “Yet if I speak, my pain is not relieved; and if I refrain, it does not go away.
18016007 Surely, God, you have worn me out; you have devastated my entire household.
18016008 You have shriveled me up—and it has become a witness; my gauntness rises up and testifies against me.
18016009 God assails me and tears me in his anger and gnashes his teeth at me; my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes.
18016010 People open their mouths to jeer at me; they strike my cheek in scorn and unite together against me.
18016011 God has turned me over to the ungodly and thrown me into the clutches of the wicked.
18016012 All was well with me, but he shattered me; he seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has made me his target;
18016013 his archers surround me. Without pity, he pierces my kidneys and spills my gall on the ground.
18016014 Again and again he bursts upon me; he rushes at me like a warrior.
18016015 “I have sewed sackcloth over my skin and buried my brow in the dust.
18016016 My face is red with weeping, dark shadows ring my eyes;
18016017 yet my hands have been free of violence and my prayer is pure.
18016018 “Earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry never be laid to rest!
18016019 Even now my witness is in heaven; my advocate is on high.
18016020 My intercessor is my friend as my eyes pour out tears to God;
18016021 on behalf of a man he pleads with God as one pleads for a friend.
18016022 “Only a few years will pass before I take the path of no return.
18017001 My spirit is broken, my days are cut short, the grave awaits me.
18017002 Surely mockers surround me; my eyes must dwell on their hostility.
18017003 “Give me, O God, the pledge you demand. Who else will put up security for me?
18017004 You have closed their minds to understanding; therefore you will not let them triumph.
18017005 If anyone denounces their friends for reward, the eyes of their children will fail.
18017006 “God has made me a byword to everyone, a man in whose face people spit.
18017007 My eyes have grown dim with grief; my whole frame is but a shadow.
18017008 The upright are appalled at this; the innocent are aroused against the ungodly.
18017009 Nevertheless, the righteous will hold to their ways, and those with clean hands will grow stronger.
18017010 “But come on, all of you, try again! I will not find a wise man among you.
18017011 My days have passed, my plans are shattered. Yet the desires of my heart
18017012 turn night into day; in the face of the darkness light is near.
18017013 If the only home I hope for is the grave, if I spread out my bed in the realm of darkness,
18017014 if I say to corruption, ‘You are my father,’ and to the worm, ‘My mother’ or ‘My sister,’
18017015 where then is my hope— who can see any hope for me?
18017016 Will it go down to the gates of death? Will we descend together into the dust?”
18018001 Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
18018002 “When will you end these speeches? Be sensible, and then we can talk.
18018003 Why are we regarded as cattle and considered stupid in your sight?
18018004 You who tear yourself to pieces in your anger, is the earth to be abandoned for your sake? Or must the rocks be moved from their place?
18018005 “The lamp of a wicked man is snuffed out; the flame of his fire stops burning.
18018006 The light in his tent becomes dark; the lamp beside him goes out.
18018007 The vigor of his step is weakened; his own schemes throw him down.
18018008 His feet thrust him into a net; he wanders into its mesh.
18018009 A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare holds him fast.
18018010 A noose is hidden for him on the ground; a trap lies in his path.
18018011 Terrors startle him on every side and dog his every step.
18018012 Calamity is hungry for him; disaster is ready for him when he falls.
18018013 It eats away parts of his skin; death’s firstborn devours his limbs.
18018014 He is torn from the security of his tent and marched off to the king of terrors.
18018015 Fire resides in his tent; burning sulfur is scattered over his dwelling.
18018016 His roots dry up below and his branches wither above.
18018017 The memory of him perishes from the earth; he has no name in the land.
18018018 He is driven from light into the realm of darkness and is banished from the world.
18018019 He has no offspring or descendants among his people, no survivor where once he lived.
18018020 People of the west are appalled at his fate; those of the east are seized with horror.
18018021 Surely such is the dwelling of an evil man; such is the place of one who does not know God.”
18019001 Then Job replied:
18019002 “How long will you torment me and crush me with words?
18019003 Ten times now you have reproached me; shamelessly you attack me.
18019004 If it is true that I have gone astray, my error remains my concern alone.
18019005 If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my humiliation against me,
18019006 then know that God has wronged me and drawn his net around me.
18019007 “Though I cry, ‘Violence!’ I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice.
18019008 He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; he has shrouded my paths in darkness.
18019009 He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.
18019010 He tears me down on every side till I am gone; he uproots my hope like a tree.
18019011 His anger burns against me; he counts me among his enemies.
18019012 His troops advance in force; they build a siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent.
18019013 “He has alienated my family from me; my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.
18019014 My relatives have gone away; my closest friends have forgotten me.
18019015 My guests and my female servants count me a foreigner; they look on me as on a stranger.
18019016 I summon my servant, but he does not answer, though I beg him with my own mouth.
18019017 My breath is offensive to my wife; I am loathsome to my own family.
18019018 Even the little boys scorn me; when I appear, they ridicule me.
18019019 All my intimate friends detest me; those I love have turned against me.
18019020 I am nothing but skin and bones; I have escaped only by the skin of my teeth.
18019021 “Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me.
18019022 Why do you pursue me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh?
18019023 “Oh, that my words were recorded, that they were written on a scroll,
18019024 that they were inscribed with an iron tool on lead, or engraved in rock forever!
18019025 I know that my redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand on the earth.
18019026 And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God;
18019027 I myself will see him with my own eyes—I, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!
18019028 “If you say, ‘How we will hound him, since the root of the trouble lies in him, ’
18019029 you should fear the sword yourselves; for wrath will bring punishment by the sword, and then you will know that there is judgment. ”
18020001 Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
18020002 “My troubled thoughts prompt me to answer because I am greatly disturbed.
18020003 I hear a rebuke that dishonors me, and my understanding inspires me to reply.
18020004 “Surely you know how it has been from of old, ever since mankind was placed on the earth,
18020005 that the mirth of the wicked is brief, the joy of the godless lasts but a moment.
18020006 Though the pride of the godless person reaches to the heavens and his head touches the clouds,
18020007 he will perish forever, like his own dung; those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’
18020008 Like a dream he flies away, no more to be found, banished like a vision of the night.
18020009 The eye that saw him will not see him again; his place will look on him no more.
18020010 His children must make amends to the poor; his own hands must give back his wealth.
18020011 The youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie with him in the dust.
18020012 “Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he hides it under his tongue,
18020013 though he cannot bear to let it go and lets it linger in his mouth,
18020014 yet his food will turn sour in his stomach; it will become the venom of serpents within him.
18020015 He will spit out the riches he swallowed; God will make his stomach vomit them up.
18020016 He will suck the poison of serpents; the fangs of an adder will kill him.
18020017 He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream.
18020018 What he toiled for he must give back uneaten; he will not enjoy the profit from his trading.
18020019 For he has oppressed the poor and left them destitute; he has seized houses he did not build.
18020020 “Surely he will have no respite from his craving; he cannot save himself by his treasure.
18020021 Nothing is left for him to devour; his prosperity will not endure.
18020022 In the midst of his plenty, distress will overtake him; the full force of misery will come upon him.
18020023 When he has filled his belly, God will vent his burning anger against him and rain down his blows on him.
18020024 Though he flees from an iron weapon, a bronze-tipped arrow pierces him.
18020025 He pulls it out of his back, the gleaming point out of his liver. Terrors will come over him;
18020026 total darkness lies in wait for his treasures. A fire unfanned will consume him and devour what is left in his tent.
18020027 The heavens will expose his guilt; the earth will rise up against him.
18020028 A flood will carry off his house, rushing waters on the day of God’s wrath.
18020029 Such is the fate God allots the wicked, the heritage appointed for them by God.”
18021001 Then Job replied:
18021002 “Listen carefully to my words; let this be the consolation you give me.
18021003 Bear with me while I speak, and after I have spoken, mock on.
18021004 “Is my complaint directed to a human being? Why should I not be impatient?
18021005 Look at me and be appalled; clap your hand over your mouth.
18021006 When I think about this, I am terrified; trembling seizes my body.
18021007 Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power?
18021008 They see their children established around them, their offspring before their eyes.
18021009 Their homes are safe and free from fear; the rod of God is not on them.
18021010 Their bulls never fail to breed; their cows calve and do not miscarry.
18021011 They send forth their children as a flock; their little ones dance about.
18021012 They sing to the music of timbrel and lyre; they make merry to the sound of the pipe.
18021013 They spend their years in prosperity and go down to the grave in peace.
18021014 Yet they say to God, ‘Leave us alone! We have no desire to know your ways.
18021015 Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What would we gain by praying to him?’
18021016 But their prosperity is not in their own hands, so I stand aloof from the plans of the wicked.
18021017 “Yet how often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out? How often does calamity come upon them, the fate God allots in his anger?
18021018 How often are they like straw before the wind, like chaff swept away by a gale?
18021019 It is said, ‘God stores up the punishment of the wicked for their children.’ Let him repay the wicked, so that they themselves will experience it!
18021020 Let their own eyes see their destruction; let them drink the cup of the wrath of the Almighty.
18021021 For what do they care about the families they leave behind when their allotted months come to an end?
18021022 “Can anyone teach knowledge to God, since he judges even the highest?
18021023 One person dies in full vigor, completely secure and at ease,
18021024 well nourished in body, bones rich with marrow.
18021025 Another dies in bitterness of soul, never having enjoyed anything good.
18021026 Side by side they lie in the dust, and worms cover them both.
18021027 “I know full well what you are thinking, the schemes by which you would wrong me.
18021028 You say, ‘Where now is the house of the great, the tents where the wicked lived?’
18021029 Have you never questioned those who travel? Have you paid no regard to their accounts—
18021030 that the wicked are spared from the day of calamity, that they are delivered from the day of wrath?
18021031 Who denounces their conduct to their face? Who repays them for what they have done?
18021032 They are carried to the grave, and watch is kept over their tombs.
18021033 The soil in the valley is sweet to them; everyone follows after them, and a countless throng goes before them.
18021034 “So how can you console me with your nonsense? Nothing is left of your answers but falsehood!”
18022001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
18022002 “Can a man be of benefit to God? Can even a wise person benefit him?
18022003 What pleasure would it give the Almighty if you were righteous? What would he gain if your ways were blameless?
18022004 “Is it for your piety that he rebukes you and brings charges against you?
18022005 Is not your wickedness great? Are not your sins endless?
18022006 You demanded security from your relatives for no reason; you stripped people of their clothing, leaving them naked.
18022007 You gave no water to the weary and you withheld food from the hungry,
18022008 though you were a powerful man, owning land— an honored man, living on it.
18022009 And you sent widows away empty-handed and broke the strength of the fatherless.
18022010 That is why snares are all around you, why sudden peril terrifies you,
18022011 why it is so dark you cannot see, and why a flood of water covers you.
18022012 “Is not God in the heights of heaven? And see how lofty are the highest stars!
18022013 Yet you say, ‘What does God know? Does he judge through such darkness?
18022014 Thick clouds veil him, so he does not see us as he goes about in the vaulted heavens.’
18022015 Will you keep to the old path that the wicked have trod?
18022016 They were carried off before their time, their foundations washed away by a flood.
18022017 They said to God, ‘Leave us alone! What can the Almighty do to us?’
18022018 Yet it was he who filled their houses with good things, so I stand aloof from the plans of the wicked.
18022019 The righteous see their ruin and rejoice; the innocent mock them, saying,
18022020 ‘Surely our foes are destroyed, and fire devours their wealth.’
18022021 “Submit to God and be at peace with him; in this way prosperity will come to you.
18022022 Accept instruction from his mouth and lay up his words in your heart.
18022023 If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored: If you remove wickedness far from your tent
18022024 and assign your nuggets to the dust, your gold of Ophir to the rocks in the ravines,
18022025 then the Almighty will be your gold, the choicest silver for you.
18022026 Surely then you will find delight in the Almighty and will lift up your face to God.
18022027 You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows.
18022028 What you decide on will be done, and light will shine on your ways.
18022029 When people are brought low and you say, ‘Lift them up!’ then he will save the downcast.
18022030 He will deliver even one who is not innocent, who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.”
18023001 Then Job replied:
18023002 “Even today my complaint is bitter; his hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.
18023003 If only I knew where to find him; if only I could go to his dwelling!
18023004 I would state my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.
18023005 I would find out what he would answer me, and consider what he would say to me.
18023006 Would he vigorously oppose me? No, he would not press charges against me.
18023007 There the upright can establish their innocence before him, and there I would be delivered forever from my judge.
18023008 “But if I go to the east, he is not there; if I go to the west, I do not find him.
18023009 When he is at work in the north, I do not see him; when he turns to the south, I catch no glimpse of him.
18023010 But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold.
18023011 My feet have closely followed his steps; I have kept to his way without turning aside.
18023012 I have not departed from the commands of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread.
18023013 “But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? He does whatever he pleases.
18023014 He carries out his decree against me, and many such plans he still has in store.
18023015 That is why I am terrified before him; when I think of all this, I fear him.
18023016 God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.
18023017 Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face.
18024001 “Why does the Almighty not set times for judgment? Why must those who know him look in vain for such days?
18024002 There are those who move boundary stones; they pasture flocks they have stolen.
18024003 They drive away the orphan’s donkey and take the widow’s ox in pledge.
18024004 They thrust the needy from the path and force all the poor of the land into hiding.
18024005 Like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go about their labor of foraging food; the wasteland provides food for their children.
18024006 They gather fodder in the fields and glean in the vineyards of the wicked.
18024007 Lacking clothes, they spend the night naked; they have nothing to cover themselves in the cold.
18024008 They are drenched by mountain rains and hug the rocks for lack of shelter.
18024009 The fatherless child is snatched from the breast; the infant of the poor is seized for a debt.
18024010 Lacking clothes, they go about naked; they carry the sheaves, but still go hungry.
18024011 They crush olives among the terraces ; they tread the winepresses, yet suffer thirst.
18024012 The groans of the dying rise from the city, and the souls of the wounded cry out for help. But God charges no one with wrongdoing.
18024013 “There are those who rebel against the light, who do not know its ways or stay in its paths.
18024014 When daylight is gone, the murderer rises up, kills the poor and needy, and in the night steals forth like a thief.
18024015 The eye of the adulterer watches for dusk; he thinks, ‘No eye will see me,’ and he keeps his face concealed.
18024016 In the dark, thieves break into houses, but by day they shut themselves in; they want nothing to do with the light.
18024017 For all of them, midnight is their morning; they make friends with the terrors of darkness.
18024018 “Yet they are foam on the surface of the water; their portion of the land is cursed, so that no one goes to the vineyards.
18024019 As heat and drought snatch away the melted snow, so the grave snatches away those who have sinned.
18024020 The womb forgets them, the worm feasts on them; the wicked are no longer remembered but are broken like a tree.
18024021 They prey on the barren and childless woman, and to the widow they show no kindness.
18024022 But God drags away the mighty by his power; though they become established, they have no assurance of life.
18024023 He may let them rest in a feeling of security, but his eyes are on their ways.
18024024 For a little while they are exalted, and then they are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like heads of grain.
18024025 “If this is not so, who can prove me false and reduce my words to nothing?”
18025001 Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
18025002 “Dominion and awe belong to God; he establishes order in the heights of heaven.
18025003 Can his forces be numbered? On whom does his light not rise?
18025004 How then can a mortal be righteous before God? How can one born of woman be pure?
18025005 If even the moon is not bright and the stars are not pure in his eyes,
18025006 how much less a mortal, who is but a maggot— a human being, who is only a worm!”
18026001 Then Job replied:
18026002 “How you have helped the powerless! How you have saved the arm that is feeble!
18026003 What advice you have offered to one without wisdom! And what great insight you have displayed!
18026004 Who has helped you utter these words? And whose spirit spoke from your mouth?
18026005 “The dead are in deep anguish, those beneath the waters and all that live in them.
18026006 The realm of the dead is naked before God; Destruction lies uncovered.
18026007 He spreads out the northern skies over empty space; he suspends the earth over nothing.
18026008 He wraps up the waters in his clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their weight.
18026009 He covers the face of the full moon, spreading his clouds over it.
18026010 He marks out the horizon on the face of the waters for a boundary between light and darkness.
18026011 The pillars of the heavens quake, aghast at his rebuke.
18026012 By his power he churned up the sea; by his wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces.
18026013 By his breath the skies became fair; his hand pierced the gliding serpent.
18026014 And these are but the outer fringe of his works; how faint the whisper we hear of him! Who then can understand the thunder of his power?”
18027001 And Job continued his discourse:
18027002 “As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice, the Almighty, who has made my life bitter,
18027003 as long as I have life within me, the breath of God in my nostrils,
18027004 my lips will not say anything wicked, and my tongue will not utter lies.
18027005 I will never admit you are in the right; till I die, I will not deny my integrity.
18027006 I will maintain my innocence and never let go of it; my conscience will not reproach me as long as I live.
18027007 “May my enemy be like the wicked, my adversary like the unjust!
18027008 For what hope have the godless when they are cut off, when God takes away their life?
18027009 Does God listen to their cry when distress comes upon them?
18027010 Will they find delight in the Almighty? Will they call on God at all times?
18027011 “I will teach you about the power of God; the ways of the Almighty I will not conceal.
18027012 You have all seen this yourselves. Why then this meaningless talk?
18027013 “Here is the fate God allots to the wicked, the heritage a ruthless man receives from the Almighty:
18027014 However many his children, their fate is the sword; his offspring will never have enough to eat.
18027015 The plague will bury those who survive him, and their widows will not weep for them.
18027016 Though he heaps up silver like dust and clothes like piles of clay,
18027017 what he lays up the righteous will wear, and the innocent will divide his silver.
18027018 The house he builds is like a moth’s cocoon, like a hut made by a watchman.
18027019 He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, all is gone.
18027020 Terrors overtake him like a flood; a tempest snatches him away in the night.
18027021 The east wind carries him off, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.
18027022 It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power.
18027023 It claps its hands in derision and hisses him out of his place.”
18028001 There is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined.
18028002 Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore.
18028003 Mortals put an end to the darkness; they search out the farthest recesses for ore in the blackest darkness.
18028004 Far from human dwellings they cut a shaft, in places untouched by human feet; far from other people they dangle and sway.
18028005 The earth, from which food comes, is transformed below as by fire;
18028006 lapis lazuli comes from its rocks, and its dust contains nuggets of gold.
18028007 No bird of prey knows that hidden path, no falcon’s eye has seen it.
18028008 Proud beasts do not set foot on it, and no lion prowls there.
18028009 People assault the flinty rock with their hands and lay bare the roots of the mountains.
18028010 They tunnel through the rock; their eyes see all its treasures.
18028011 They search the sources of the rivers and bring hidden things to light.
18028012 But where can wisdom be found? Where does understanding dwell?
18028013 No mortal comprehends its worth; it cannot be found in the land of the living.
18028014 The deep says, “It is not in me”; the sea says, “It is not with me.”
18028015 It cannot be bought with the finest gold, nor can its price be weighed out in silver.
18028016 It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir, with precious onyx or lapis lazuli.
18028017 Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it, nor can it be had for jewels of gold.
18028018 Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.
18028019 The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it; it cannot be bought with pure gold.
18028020 Where then does wisdom come from? Where does understanding dwell?
18028021 It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing, concealed even from the birds in the sky.
18028022 Destruction and Death say, “Only a rumor of it has reached our ears.”
18028023 God understands the way to it and he alone knows where it dwells,
18028024 for he views the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.
18028025 When he established the force of the wind and measured out the waters,
18028026 when he made a decree for the rain and a path for the thunderstorm,
18028027 then he looked at wisdom and appraised it; he confirmed it and tested it.
18028028 And he said to the human race, “The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding.”
18029001 Job continued his discourse:
18029002 “How I long for the months gone by, for the days when God watched over me,
18029003 when his lamp shone on my head and by his light I walked through darkness!
18029004 Oh, for the days when I was in my prime, when God’s intimate friendship blessed my house,
18029005 when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me,
18029006 when my path was drenched with cream and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil.
18029007 “When I went to the gate of the city and took my seat in the public square,
18029008 the young men saw me and stepped aside and the old men rose to their feet;
18029009 the chief men refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands;
18029010 the voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.
18029011 Whoever heard me spoke well of me, and those who saw me commended me,
18029012 because I rescued the poor who cried for help, and the fatherless who had none to assist them.
18029013 The one who was dying blessed me; I made the widow’s heart sing.
18029014 I put on righteousness as my clothing; justice was my robe and my turban.
18029015 I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.
18029016 I was a father to the needy; I took up the case of the stranger.
18029017 I broke the fangs of the wicked and snatched the victims from their teeth.
18029018 “I thought, ‘I will die in my own house, my days as numerous as the grains of sand.
18029019 My roots will reach to the water, and the dew will lie all night on my branches.
18029020 My glory will not fade; the bow will be ever new in my hand.’
18029021 “People listened to me expectantly, waiting in silence for my counsel.
18029022 After I had spoken, they spoke no more; my words fell gently on their ears.
18029023 They waited for me as for showers and drank in my words as the spring rain.
18029024 When I smiled at them, they scarcely believed it; the light of my face was precious to them.
18029025 I chose the way for them and sat as their chief; I dwelt as a king among his troops; I was like one who comforts mourners.
18030001 “But now they mock me, men younger than I, whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs.
18030002 Of what use was the strength of their hands to me, since their vigor had gone from them?
18030003 Haggard from want and hunger, they roamed the parched land in desolate wastelands at night.
18030004 In the brush they gathered salt herbs, and their food was the root of the broom bush.
18030005 They were banished from human society, shouted at as if they were thieves.
18030006 They were forced to live in the dry stream beds, among the rocks and in holes in the ground.
18030007 They brayed among the bushes and huddled in the undergrowth.
18030008 A base and nameless brood, they were driven out of the land.
18030009 “And now those young men mock me in song; I have become a byword among them.
18030010 They detest me and keep their distance; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.
18030011 Now that God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me, they throw off restraint in my presence.
18030012 On my right the tribe attacks; they lay snares for my feet, they build their siege ramps against me.
18030013 They break up my road; they succeed in destroying me. ‘No one can help him,’ they say.
18030014 They advance as through a gaping breach; amid the ruins they come rolling in.
18030015 Terrors overwhelm me; my dignity is driven away as by the wind, my safety vanishes like a cloud.
18030016 “And now my life ebbs away; days of suffering grip me.
18030017 Night pierces my bones; my gnawing pains never rest.
18030018 In his great power God becomes like clothing to me ; he binds me like the neck of my garment.
18030019 He throws me into the mud, and I am reduced to dust and ashes.
18030020 “I cry out to you, God, but you do not answer; I stand up, but you merely look at me.
18030021 You turn on me ruthlessly; with the might of your hand you attack me.
18030022 You snatch me up and drive me before the wind; you toss me about in the storm.
18030023 I know you will bring me down to death, to the place appointed for all the living.
18030024 “Surely no one lays a hand on a broken man when he cries for help in his distress.
18030025 Have I not wept for those in trouble? Has not my soul grieved for the poor?
18030026 Yet when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, then came darkness.
18030027 The churning inside me never stops; days of suffering confront me.
18030028 I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.
18030029 I have become a brother of jackals, a companion of owls.
18030030 My skin grows black and peels; my body burns with fever.
18030031 My lyre is tuned to mourning, and my pipe to the sound of wailing.
18031001 “I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a young woman.
18031002 For what is our lot from God above, our heritage from the Almighty on high?
18031003 Is it not ruin for the wicked, disaster for those who do wrong?
18031004 Does he not see my ways and count my every step?
18031005 “If I have walked with falsehood or my foot has hurried after deceit—
18031006 let God weigh me in honest scales and he will know that I am blameless—
18031007 if my steps have turned from the path, if my heart has been led by my eyes, or if my hands have been defiled,
18031008 then may others eat what I have sown, and may my crops be uprooted.
18031009 “If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbor’s door,
18031010 then may my wife grind another man’s grain, and may other men sleep with her.
18031011 For that would have been wicked, a sin to be judged.
18031012 It is a fire that burns to Destruction ; it would have uprooted my harvest.
18031013 “If I have denied justice to any of my servants, whether male or female, when they had a grievance against me,
18031014 what will I do when God confronts me? What will I answer when called to account?
18031015 Did not he who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same one form us both within our mothers?
18031016 “If I have denied the desires of the poor or let the eyes of the widow grow weary,
18031017 if I have kept my bread to myself, not sharing it with the fatherless—
18031018 but from my youth I reared them as a father would, and from my birth I guided the widow—
18031019 if I have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing, or the needy without garments,
18031020 and their hearts did not bless me for warming them with the fleece from my sheep,
18031021 if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, knowing that I had influence in court,
18031022 then let my arm fall from the shoulder, let it be broken off at the joint.
18031023 For I dreaded destruction from God, and for fear of his splendor I could not do such things.
18031024 “If I have put my trust in gold or said to pure gold, ‘You are my security,’
18031025 if I have rejoiced over my great wealth, the fortune my hands had gained,
18031026 if I have regarded the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor,
18031027 so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand offered them a kiss of homage,
18031028 then these also would be sins to be judged, for I would have been unfaithful to God on high.
18031029 “If I have rejoiced at my enemy’s misfortune or gloated over the trouble that came to him—
18031030 I have not allowed my mouth to sin by invoking a curse against their life—
18031031 if those of my household have never said, ‘Who has not been filled with Job’s meat?’—
18031032 but no stranger had to spend the night in the street, for my door was always open to the traveler—
18031033 if I have concealed my sin as people do, by hiding my guilt in my heart
18031034 because I so feared the crowd and so dreaded the contempt of the clans that I kept silent and would not go outside—
18031035 (“Oh, that I had someone to hear me! I sign now my defense—let the Almighty answer me; let my accuser put his indictment in writing.
18031036 Surely I would wear it on my shoulder, I would put it on like a crown.
18031037 I would give him an account of my every step; I would present it to him as to a ruler.)—
18031038 “if my land cries out against me and all its furrows are wet with tears,
18031039 if I have devoured its yield without payment or broken the spirit of its tenants,
18031040 then let briers come up instead of wheat and stinkweed instead of barley.” The words of Job are ended.
18032001 So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
18032002 But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God.
18032003 He was also angry with the three friends, because they had found no way to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.
18032004 Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he.
18032005 But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say, his anger was aroused.
18032006 So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said: “I am young in years, and you are old; that is why I was fearful, not daring to tell you what I know.
18032007 I thought, ‘Age should speak; advanced years should teach wisdom.’
18032008 But it is the spirit in a person, the breath of the Almighty, that gives them understanding.
18032009 It is not only the old who are wise, not only the aged who understand what is right.
18032010 “Therefore I say: Listen to me; I too will tell you what I know.
18032011 I waited while you spoke, I listened to your reasoning; while you were searching for words,
18032012 I gave you my full attention. But not one of you has proved Job wrong; none of you has answered his arguments.
18032013 Do not say, ‘We have found wisdom; let God, not a man, refute him.’
18032014 But Job has not marshaled his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments.
18032015 “They are dismayed and have no more to say; words have failed them.
18032016 Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand there with no reply?
18032017 I too will have my say; I too will tell what I know.
18032018 For I am full of words, and the spirit within me compels me;
18032019 inside I am like bottled-up wine, like new wineskins ready to burst.
18032020 I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and reply.
18032021 I will show no partiality, nor will I flatter anyone;
18032022 for if I were skilled in flattery, my Maker would soon take me away.
18033001 “But now, Job, listen to my words; pay attention to everything I say.
18033002 I am about to open my mouth; my words are on the tip of my tongue.
18033003 My words come from an upright heart; my lips sincerely speak what I know.
18033004 The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
18033005 Answer me then, if you can; stand up and argue your case before me.
18033006 I am the same as you in God’s sight; I too am a piece of clay.
18033007 No fear of me should alarm you, nor should my hand be heavy on you.
18033008 “But you have said in my hearing— I heard the very words—
18033009 ‘I am pure, I have done no wrong; I am clean and free from sin.
18033010 Yet God has found fault with me; he considers me his enemy.
18033011 He fastens my feet in shackles; he keeps close watch on all my paths.’
18033012 “But I tell you, in this you are not right, for God is greater than any mortal.
18033013 Why do you complain to him that he responds to no one’s words ?
18033014 For God does speak—now one way, now another— though no one perceives it.
18033015 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on people as they slumber in their beds,
18033016 he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings,
18033017 to turn them from wrongdoing and keep them from pride,
18033018 to preserve them from the pit, their lives from perishing by the sword.
18033019 “Or someone may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in their bones,
18033020 so that their body finds food repulsive and their soul loathes the choicest meal.
18033021 Their flesh wastes away to nothing, and their bones, once hidden, now stick out.
18033022 They draw near to the pit, and their life to the messengers of death.
18033023 Yet if there is an angel at their side, a messenger, one out of a thousand, sent to tell them how to be upright,
18033024 and he is gracious to that person and says to God, ‘Spare them from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom for them—
18033025 let their flesh be renewed like a child’s; let them be restored as in the days of their youth’—
18033026 then that person can pray to God and find favor with him, they will see God’s face and shout for joy; he will restore them to full well-being.
18033027 And they will go to others and say, ‘I have sinned, I have perverted what is right, but I did not get what I deserved.
18033028 God has delivered me from going down to the pit, and I shall live to enjoy the light of life.’
18033029 “God does all these things to a person— twice, even three times—
18033030 to turn them back from the pit, that the light of life may shine on them.
18033031 “Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.
18033032 If you have anything to say, answer me; speak up, for I want to vindicate you.
18033033 But if not, then listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”
18034001 Then Elihu said:
18034002 “Hear my words, you wise men; listen to me, you men of learning.
18034003 For the ear tests words as the tongue tastes food.
18034004 Let us discern for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good.
18034005 “Job says, ‘I am innocent, but God denies me justice.
18034006 Although I am right, I am considered a liar; although I am guiltless, his arrow inflicts an incurable wound.’
18034007 Is there anyone like Job, who drinks scorn like water?
18034008 He keeps company with evildoers; he associates with the wicked.
18034009 For he says, ‘There is no profit in trying to please God.’
18034010 “So listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do evil, from the Almighty to do wrong.
18034011 He repays everyone for what they have done; he brings on them what their conduct deserves.
18034012 It is unthinkable that God would do wrong, that the Almighty would pervert justice.
18034013 Who appointed him over the earth? Who put him in charge of the whole world?
18034014 If it were his intention and he withdrew his spirit and breath,
18034015 all humanity would perish together and mankind would return to the dust.
18034016 “If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say.
18034017 Can someone who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One?
18034018 Is he not the One who says to kings, ‘You are worthless,’ and to nobles, ‘You are wicked,’
18034019 who shows no partiality to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of his hands?
18034020 They die in an instant, in the middle of the night; the people are shaken and they pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand.
18034021 “His eyes are on the ways of mortals; he sees their every step.
18034022 There is no deep shadow, no utter darkness, where evildoers can hide.
18034023 God has no need to examine people further, that they should come before him for judgment.
18034024 Without inquiry he shatters the mighty and sets up others in their place.
18034025 Because he takes note of their deeds, he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.
18034026 He punishes them for their wickedness where everyone can see them,
18034027 because they turned from following him and had no regard for any of his ways.
18034028 They caused the cry of the poor to come before him, so that he heard the cry of the needy.
18034029 But if he remains silent, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, who can see him? Yet he is over individual and nation alike,
18034030 to keep the godless from ruling, from laying snares for the people.
18034031 “Suppose someone says to God, ‘I am guilty but will offend no more.
18034032 Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.’
18034033 Should God then reward you on your terms, when you refuse to repent? You must decide, not I; so tell me what you know.
18034034 “Men of understanding declare, wise men who hear me say to me,
18034035 ‘Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.’
18034036 Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost for answering like a wicked man!
18034037 To his sin he adds rebellion; scornfully he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God.”
18035001 Then Elihu said:
18035002 “Do you think this is just? You say, ‘I am in the right, not God.’
18035003 Yet you ask him, ‘What profit is it to me, and what do I gain by not sinning?’
18035004 “I would like to reply to you and to your friends with you.
18035005 Look up at the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds so high above you.
18035006 If you sin, how does that affect him? If your sins are many, what does that do to him?
18035007 If you are righteous, what do you give to him, or what does he receive from your hand?
18035008 Your wickedness only affects humans like yourself, and your righteousness only other people.
18035009 “People cry out under a load of oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.
18035010 But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,
18035011 who teaches us more than he teaches the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds in the sky?’
18035012 He does not answer when people cry out because of the arrogance of the wicked.
18035013 Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea; the Almighty pays no attention to it.
18035014 How much less, then, will he listen when you say that you do not see him, that your case is before him and you must wait for him,
18035015 and further, that his anger never punishes and he does not take the least notice of wickedness.
18035016 So Job opens his mouth with empty talk; without knowledge he multiplies words.”
18036001 Elihu continued:
18036002 “Bear with me a little longer and I will show you that there is more to be said in God’s behalf.
18036003 I get my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe justice to my Maker.
18036004 Be assured that my words are not false; one who has perfect knowledge is with you.
18036005 “God is mighty, but despises no one; he is mighty, and firm in his purpose.
18036006 He does not keep the wicked alive but gives the afflicted their rights.
18036007 He does not take his eyes off the righteous; he enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever.
18036008 But if people are bound in chains, held fast by cords of affliction,
18036009 he tells them what they have done— that they have sinned arrogantly.
18036010 He makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil.
18036011 If they obey and serve him, they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment.
18036012 But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword and die without knowledge.
18036013 “The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when he fetters them, they do not cry for help.
18036014 They die in their youth, among male prostitutes of the shrines.
18036015 But those who suffer he delivers in their suffering; he speaks to them in their affliction.
18036016 “He is wooing you from the jaws of distress to a spacious place free from restriction, to the comfort of your table laden with choice food.
18036017 But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have taken hold of you.
18036018 Be careful that no one entices you by riches; do not let a large bribe turn you aside.
18036019 Would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts sustain you so you would not be in distress?
18036020 Do not long for the night, to drag people away from their homes.
18036021 Beware of turning to evil, which you seem to prefer to affliction.
18036022 “God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him?
18036023 Who has prescribed his ways for him, or said to him, ‘You have done wrong’?
18036024 Remember to extol his work, which people have praised in song.
18036025 All humanity has seen it; mortals gaze on it from afar.
18036026 How great is God—beyond our understanding! The number of his years is past finding out.
18036027 “He draws up the drops of water, which distill as rain to the streams ;
18036028 the clouds pour down their moisture and abundant showers fall on mankind.
18036029 Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds, how he thunders from his pavilion?
18036030 See how he scatters his lightning about him, bathing the depths of the sea.
18036031 This is the way he governs the nations and provides food in abundance.
18036032 He fills his hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark.
18036033 His thunder announces the coming storm; even the cattle make known its approach.
18037001 “At this my heart pounds and leaps from its place.
18037002 Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice, to the rumbling that comes from his mouth.
18037003 He unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heaven and sends it to the ends of the earth.
18037004 After that comes the sound of his roar; he thunders with his majestic voice. When his voice resounds, he holds nothing back.
18037005 God’s voice thunders in marvelous ways; he does great things beyond our understanding.
18037006 He says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’ and to the rain shower, ‘Be a mighty downpour.’
18037007 So that everyone he has made may know his work, he stops all people from their labor.
18037008 The animals take cover; they remain in their dens.
18037009 The tempest comes out from its chamber, the cold from the driving winds.
18037010 The breath of God produces ice, and the broad waters become frozen.
18037011 He loads the clouds with moisture; he scatters his lightning through them.
18037012 At his direction they swirl around over the face of the whole earth to do whatever he commands them.
18037013 He brings the clouds to punish people, or to water his earth and show his love.
18037014 “Listen to this, Job; stop and consider God’s wonders.
18037015 Do you know how God controls the clouds and makes his lightning flash?
18037016 Do you know how the clouds hang poised, those wonders of him who has perfect knowledge?
18037017 You who swelter in your clothes when the land lies hushed under the south wind,
18037018 can you join him in spreading out the skies, hard as a mirror of cast bronze?
18037019 “Tell us what we should say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness.
18037020 Should he be told that I want to speak? Would anyone ask to be swallowed up?
18037021 Now no one can look at the sun, bright as it is in the skies after the wind has swept them clean.
18037022 Out of the north he comes in golden splendor; God comes in awesome majesty.
18037023 The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress.
18037024 Therefore, people revere him, for does he not have regard for all the wise in heart? ”
18038001 Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm. He said:
18038002 “Who is this that obscures my plans with words without knowledge?
18038003 Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me.
18038004 “Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation? Tell me, if you understand.
18038005 Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it?
18038006 On what were its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone—
18038007 while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy?
18038008 “Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb,
18038009 when I made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness,
18038010 when I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place,
18038011 when I said, ‘This far you may come and no farther; here is where your proud waves halt’?
18038012 “Have you ever given orders to the morning, or shown the dawn its place,
18038013 that it might take the earth by the edges and shake the wicked out of it?
18038014 The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its features stand out like those of a garment.
18038015 The wicked are denied their light, and their upraised arm is broken.
18038016 “Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep?
18038017 Have the gates of death been shown to you? Have you seen the gates of the deepest darkness?
18038018 Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth? Tell me, if you know all this.
18038019 “What is the way to the abode of light? And where does darkness reside?
18038020 Can you take them to their places? Do you know the paths to their dwellings?
18038021 Surely you know, for you were already born! You have lived so many years!
18038022 “Have you entered the storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of the hail,
18038023 which I reserve for times of trouble, for days of war and battle?
18038024 What is the way to the place where the lightning is dispersed, or the place where the east winds are scattered over the earth?
18038025 Who cuts a channel for the torrents of rain, and a path for the thunderstorm,
18038026 to water a land where no one lives, an uninhabited desert,
18038027 to satisfy a desolate wasteland and make it sprout with grass?
18038028 Does the rain have a father? Who fathers the drops of dew?
18038029 From whose womb comes the ice? Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens
18038030 when the waters become hard as stone, when the surface of the deep is frozen?
18038031 “Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades? Can you loosen Orion’s belt?
18038032 Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons or lead out the Bear with its cubs?
18038033 Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set up God’s dominion over the earth?
18038034 “Can you raise your voice to the clouds and cover yourself with a flood of water?
18038035 Do you send the lightning bolts on their way? Do they report to you, ‘Here we are’?
18038036 Who gives the ibis wisdom or gives the rooster understanding?
18038037 Who has the wisdom to count the clouds? Who can tip over the water jars of the heavens
18038038 when the dust becomes hard and the clods of earth stick together?
18038039 “Do you hunt the prey for the lioness and satisfy the hunger of the lions
18038040 when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in a thicket?
18038041 Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God and wander about for lack of food?
18039001 “Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you watch when the doe bears her fawn?
18039002 Do you count the months till they bear? Do you know the time they give birth?
18039003 They crouch down and bring forth their young; their labor pains are ended.
18039004 Their young thrive and grow strong in the wilds; they leave and do not return.
18039005 “Who let the wild donkey go free? Who untied its ropes?
18039006 I gave it the wasteland as its home, the salt flats as its habitat.
18039007 It laughs at the commotion in the town; it does not hear a driver’s shout.
18039008 It ranges the hills for its pasture and searches for any green thing.
18039009 “Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will it stay by your manger at night?
18039010 Can you hold it to the furrow with a harness? Will it till the valleys behind you?
18039011 Will you rely on it for its great strength? Will you leave your heavy work to it?
18039012 Can you trust it to haul in your grain and bring it to your threshing floor?
18039013 “The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, though they cannot compare with the wings and feathers of the stork.
18039014 She lays her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand,
18039015 unmindful that a foot may crush them, that some wild animal may trample them.
18039016 She treats her young harshly, as if they were not hers; she cares not that her labor was in vain,
18039017 for God did not endow her with wisdom or give her a share of good sense.
18039018 Yet when she spreads her feathers to run, she laughs at horse and rider.
18039019 “Do you give the horse its strength or clothe its neck with a flowing mane?
18039020 Do you make it leap like a locust, striking terror with its proud snorting?
18039021 It paws fiercely, rejoicing in its strength, and charges into the fray.
18039022 It laughs at fear, afraid of nothing; it does not shy away from the sword.
18039023 The quiver rattles against its side, along with the flashing spear and lance.
18039024 In frenzied excitement it eats up the ground; it cannot stand still when the trumpet sounds.
18039025 At the blast of the trumpet it snorts, ‘Aha!’ It catches the scent of battle from afar, the shout of commanders and the battle cry.
18039026 “Does the hawk take flight by your wisdom and spread its wings toward the south?
18039027 Does the eagle soar at your command and build its nest on high?
18039028 It dwells on a cliff and stays there at night; a rocky crag is its stronghold.
18039029 From there it looks for food; its eyes detect it from afar.
18039030 Its young ones feast on blood, and where the slain are, there it is.”
18040001 The Lord said to Job:
18040002 “Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let him who accuses God answer him!”
18040003 Then Job answered the Lord:
18040004 “I am unworthy—how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth.
18040005 I spoke once, but I have no answer— twice, but I will say no more.”
18040006 Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm:
18040007 “Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me.
18040008 “Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself?
18040009 Do you have an arm like God’s, and can your voice thunder like his?
18040010 Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor, and clothe yourself in honor and majesty.
18040011 Unleash the fury of your wrath, look at all who are proud and bring them low,
18040012 look at all who are proud and humble them, crush the wicked where they stand.
18040013 Bury them all in the dust together; shroud their faces in the grave.
18040014 Then I myself will admit to you that your own right hand can save you.
18040015 “Look at Behemoth, which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox.
18040016 What strength it has in its loins, what power in the muscles of its belly!
18040017 Its tail sways like a cedar; the sinews of its thighs are close-knit.
18040018 Its bones are tubes of bronze, its limbs like rods of iron.
18040019 It ranks first among the works of God, yet its Maker can approach it with his sword.
18040020 The hills bring it their produce, and all the wild animals play nearby.
18040021 Under the lotus plants it lies, hidden among the reeds in the marsh.
18040022 The lotuses conceal it in their shadow; the poplars by the stream surround it.
18040023 A raging river does not alarm it; it is secure, though the Jordan should surge against its mouth.
18040024 Can anyone capture it by the eyes, or trap it and pierce its nose?
18041001 “Can you pull in Leviathan with a fishhook or tie down its tongue with a rope?
18041002 Can you put a cord through its nose or pierce its jaw with a hook?
18041003 Will it keep begging you for mercy? Will it speak to you with gentle words?
18041004 Will it make an agreement with you for you to take it as your slave for life?
18041005 Can you make a pet of it like a bird or put it on a leash for the young women in your house?
18041006 Will traders barter for it? Will they divide it up among the merchants?
18041007 Can you fill its hide with harpoons or its head with fishing spears?
18041008 If you lay a hand on it, you will remember the struggle and never do it again!
18041009 Any hope of subduing it is false; the mere sight of it is overpowering.
18041010 No one is fierce enough to rouse it. Who then is able to stand against me?
18041011 Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me.
18041012 “I will not fail to speak of Leviathan’s limbs, its strength and its graceful form.
18041013 Who can strip off its outer coat? Who can penetrate its double coat of armor ?
18041014 Who dares open the doors of its mouth, ringed about with fearsome teeth?
18041015 Its back has rows of shields tightly sealed together;
18041016 each is so close to the next that no air can pass between.
18041017 They are joined fast to one another; they cling together and cannot be parted.
18041018 Its snorting throws out flashes of light; its eyes are like the rays of dawn.
18041019 Flames stream from its mouth; sparks of fire shoot out.
18041020 Smoke pours from its nostrils as from a boiling pot over burning reeds.
18041021 Its breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from its mouth.
18041022 Strength resides in its neck; dismay goes before it.
18041023 The folds of its flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.
18041024 Its chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone.
18041025 When it rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before its thrashing.
18041026 The sword that reaches it has no effect, nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin.
18041027 Iron it treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood.
18041028 Arrows do not make it flee; slingstones are like chaff to it.
18041029 A club seems to it but a piece of straw; it laughs at the rattling of the lance.
18041030 Its undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.
18041031 It makes the depths churn like a boiling caldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.
18041032 It leaves a glistening wake behind it; one would think the deep had white hair.
18041033 Nothing on earth is its equal— a creature without fear.
18041034 It looks down on all that are haughty; it is king over all that are proud.”
18042001 Then Job replied to the Lord:
18042002 “I know that you can do all things; no purpose of yours can be thwarted.
18042003 You asked, ‘Who is this that obscures my plans without knowledge?’ Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know.
18042004 “You said, ‘Listen now, and I will speak; I will question you, and you shall answer me.’
18042005 My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you.
18042006 Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes.”
18042007 After the Lord had said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken the truth about me, as my servant Job has.
18042008 So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken the truth about me, as my servant Job has.”
18042009 So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the Lord told them; and the Lord accepted Job’s prayer.
18042010 After Job had prayed for his friends, the Lord restored his fortunes and gave him twice as much as he had before.
18042011 All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the Lord had brought on him, and each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring.
18042012 The Lord blessed the latter part of Job’s life more than the former part. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys.
18042013 And he also had seven sons and three daughters.
18042014 The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch.
18042015 Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job’s daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers.
18042016 After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation.
18042017 And so Job died, an old man and full of years.
19001001 Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers,
19001002 but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night.
19001003 That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither— whatever they do prospers.
19001004 Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.
19001005 Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
19001006 For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.
19002001 Why do the nations conspire and the peoples plot in vain?
19002002 The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord and against his anointed, saying,
19002003 “Let us break their chains and throw off their shackles.”
19002004 The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord scoffs at them.
19002005 He rebukes them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath, saying,
19002006 “I have installed my king on Zion, my holy mountain.”
19002007 I will proclaim the Lord’s decree: He said to me, “You are my son; today I have become your father.
19002008 Ask me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession.
19002009 You will break them with a rod of iron ; you will dash them to pieces like pottery.”
19002010 Therefore, you kings, be wise; be warned, you rulers of the earth.
19002011 Serve the Lord with fear and celebrate his rule with trembling.
19002012 Kiss his son, or he will be angry and your way will lead to your destruction, for his wrath can flare up in a moment. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.
19003000 A psalm of David. When he fled from his son Absalom.
19003001 Lord, how many are my foes! How many rise up against me!
19003002 Many are saying of me, “God will not deliver him.”
19003003 But you, Lord, are a shield around me, my glory, the One who lifts my head high.
19003004 I call out to the Lord, and he answers me from his holy mountain.
19003005 I lie down and sleep; I wake again, because the Lord sustains me.
19003006 I will not fear though tens of thousands assail me on every side.
19003007 Arise, Lord! Deliver me, my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break the teeth of the wicked.
19003008 From the Lord comes deliverance. May your blessing be on your people.
19004000 For the director of music. With stringed instruments. A psalm of David.
19004001 Answer me when I call to you, my righteous God. Give me relief from my distress; have mercy on me and hear my prayer.
19004002 How long will you people turn my glory into shame? How long will you love delusions and seek false gods
19004003 Know that the Lord has set apart his faithful servant for himself; the Lord hears when I call to him.
19004004 Tremble and do not sin; when you are on your beds, search your hearts and be silent.
19004005 Offer the sacrifices of the righteous and trust in the Lord.
19004006 Many, Lord, are asking, “Who will bring us prosperity?” Let the light of your face shine on us.
19004007 Fill my heart with joy when their grain and new wine abound.
19004008 In peace I will lie down and sleep, for you alone, Lord, make me dwell in safety.
19005000 For the director of music. For pipes. A psalm of David.
19005001 Listen to my words, Lord, consider my lament.
19005002 Hear my cry for help, my King and my God, for to you I pray.
19005003 In the morning, Lord, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait expectantly.
19005004 For you are not a God who is pleased with wickedness; with you, evil people are not welcome.
19005005 The arrogant cannot stand in your presence. You hate all who do wrong;
19005006 you destroy those who tell lies. The bloodthirsty and deceitful you, Lord, detest.
19005007 But I, by your great love, can come into your house; in reverence I bow down toward your holy temple.
19005008 Lead me, Lord, in your righteousness because of my enemies— make your way straight before me.
19005009 Not a word from their mouth can be trusted; their heart is filled with malice. Their throat is an open grave; with their tongues they tell lies.
19005010 Declare them guilty, O God! Let their intrigues be their downfall. Banish them for their many sins, for they have rebelled against you.
19005011 But let all who take refuge in you be glad; let them ever sing for joy. Spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may rejoice in you.
19005012 Surely, Lord, you bless the righteous; you surround them with your favor as with a shield.
19006000 For the director of music. With stringed instruments. According to sheminith. A psalm of David.
19006001 Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.
19006002 Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am faint; heal me, Lord, for my bones are in agony.
19006003 My soul is in deep anguish. How long, Lord, how long?
19006004 Turn, Lord, and deliver me; save me because of your unfailing love.
19006005 Among the dead no one proclaims your name. Who praises you from the grave?
19006006 I am worn out from my groaning. All night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.
19006007 My eyes grow weak with sorrow; they fail because of all my foes.
19006008 Away from me, all you who do evil, for the Lord has heard my weeping.
19006009 The Lord has heard my cry for mercy; the Lord accepts my prayer.
19006010 All my enemies will be overwhelmed with shame and anguish; they will turn back and suddenly be put to shame.
19007000 A shiggaion of David, which he sang to the Lord concerning Cush, a Benjamite.
19007001 Lord my God, I take refuge in you; save and deliver me from all who pursue me,
19007002 or they will tear me apart like a lion and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me.
19007003 Lord my God, if I have done this and there is guilt on my hands—
19007004 if I have repaid my ally with evil or without cause have robbed my foe—
19007005 then let my enemy pursue and overtake me; let him trample my life to the ground and make me sleep in the dust.
19007006 Arise, Lord, in your anger; rise up against the rage of my enemies. Awake, my God; decree justice.
19007007 Let the assembled peoples gather around you, while you sit enthroned over them on high.
19007008 Let the Lord judge the peoples. Vindicate me, Lord, according to my righteousness, according to my integrity, O Most High.
19007009 Bring to an end the violence of the wicked and make the righteous secure— you, the righteous God who probes minds and hearts.
19007010 My shield is God Most High, who saves the upright in heart.
19007011 God is a righteous judge, a God who displays his wrath every day.
19007012 If he does not relent, he will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow.
19007013 He has prepared his deadly weapons; he makes ready his flaming arrows.
19007014 Whoever is pregnant with evil conceives trouble and gives birth to disillusionment.
19007015 Whoever digs a hole and scoops it out falls into the pit they have made.
19007016 The trouble they cause recoils on them; their violence comes down on their own heads.
19007017 I will give thanks to the Lord because of his righteousness; I will sing the praises of the name of the Lord Most High.
19008000 For the director of music. According to gittith. A psalm of David.
19008001 Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory in the heavens.
19008002 Through the praise of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger.
19008003 When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,
19008004 what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them?
19008005 You have made them a little lower than the angels and crowned them with glory and honor.
19008006 You made them rulers over the works of your hands; you put everything under their feet:
19008007 all flocks and herds, and the animals of the wild,
19008008 the birds in the sky, and the fish in the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas.
19008009 Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!
19009000 For the director of music. To the tune of “The Death of the Son.” A psalm of David.
19009001 I will give thanks to you, Lord, with all my heart; I will tell of all your wonderful deeds.
19009002 I will be glad and rejoice in you; I will sing the praises of your name, O Most High.
19009003 My enemies turn back; they stumble and perish before you.
19009004 For you have upheld my right and my cause, sitting enthroned as the righteous judge.
19009005 You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked; you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.
19009006 Endless ruin has overtaken my enemies, you have uprooted their cities; even the memory of them has perished.
19009007 The Lord reigns forever; he has established his throne for judgment.
19009008 He rules the world in righteousness and judges the peoples with equity.
19009009 The Lord is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.
19009010 Those who know your name trust in you, for you, Lord, have never forsaken those who seek you.
19009011 Sing the praises of the Lord, enthroned in Zion; proclaim among the nations what he has done.
19009012 For he who avenges blood remembers; he does not ignore the cries of the afflicted.
19009013 Lord, see how my enemies persecute me! Have mercy and lift me up from the gates of death,
19009014 that I may declare your praises in the gates of Daughter Zion, and there rejoice in your salvation.
19009015 The nations have fallen into the pit they have dug; their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.
19009016 The Lord is known by his acts of justice; the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands.
19009017 The wicked go down to the realm of the dead, all the nations that forget God.
19009018 But God will never forget the needy; the hope of the afflicted will never perish.
19009019 Arise, Lord, do not let mortals triumph; let the nations be judged in your presence.
19009020 Strike them with terror, Lord; let the nations know they are only mortal.
19010001 Why, Lord, do you stand far off? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
19010002 In his arrogance the wicked man hunts down the weak, who are caught in the schemes he devises.
19010003 He boasts about the cravings of his heart; he blesses the greedy and reviles the Lord.
19010004 In his pride the wicked man does not seek him; in all his thoughts there is no room for God.
19010005 His ways are always prosperous; your laws are rejected by him; he sneers at all his enemies.
19010006 He says to himself, “Nothing will ever shake me.” He swears, “No one will ever do me harm.”
19010007 His mouth is full of lies and threats; trouble and evil are under his tongue.
19010008 He lies in wait near the villages; from ambush he murders the innocent. His eyes watch in secret for his victims;
19010009 like a lion in cover he lies in wait. He lies in wait to catch the helpless; he catches the helpless and drags them off in his net.
19010010 His victims are crushed, they collapse; they fall under his strength.
19010011 He says to himself, “God will never notice; he covers his face and never sees.”
19010012 Arise, Lord! Lift up your hand, O God. Do not forget the helpless.
19010013 Why does the wicked man revile God? Why does he say to himself, “He won’t call me to account”?
19010014 But you, God, see the trouble of the afflicted; you consider their grief and take it in hand. The victims commit themselves to you; you are the helper of the fatherless.
19010015 Break the arm of the wicked man; call the evildoer to account for his wickedness that would not otherwise be found out.
19010016 The Lord is King for ever and ever; the nations will perish from his land.
19010017 You, Lord, hear the desire of the afflicted; you encourage them, and you listen to their cry,
19010018 defending the fatherless and the oppressed, so that mere earthly mortals will never again strike terror.
19011000 For the director of music. Of David.
19011001 In the Lord I take refuge. How then can you say to me: “Flee like a bird to your mountain.
19011002 For look, the wicked bend their bows; they set their arrows against the strings to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.
19011003 When the foundations are being destroyed, what can the righteous do?”
19011004 The Lord is in his holy temple; the Lord is on his heavenly throne. He observes everyone on earth; his eyes examine them.
19011005 The Lord examines the righteous, but the wicked, those who love violence, he hates with a passion.
19011006 On the wicked he will rain fiery coals and burning sulfur; a scorching wind will be their lot.
19011007 For the Lord is righteous, he loves justice; the upright will see his face.
19012000 For the director of music. According to sheminith. A psalm of David.
19012001 Help, Lord, for no one is faithful anymore; those who are loyal have vanished from the human race.
19012002 Everyone lies to their neighbor; they flatter with their lips but harbor deception in their hearts.
19012003 May the Lord silence all flattering lips and every boastful tongue—
19012004 those who say, “By our tongues we will prevail; our own lips will defend us—who is lord over us?”
19012005 “Because the poor are plundered and the needy groan, I will now arise,” says the Lord. “I will protect them from those who malign them.”
19012006 And the words of the Lord are flawless, like silver purified in a crucible, like gold refined seven times.
19012007 You, Lord, will keep the needy safe and will protect us forever from the wicked,
19012008 who freely strut about when what is vile is honored by the human race.
19013000 For the director of music. A psalm of David.
19013001 How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?
19013002 How long must I wrestle with my thoughts and day after day have sorrow in my heart? How long will my enemy triumph over me?
19013003 Look on me and answer, Lord my God. Give light to my eyes, or I will sleep in death,
19013004 and my enemy will say, “I have overcome him,” and my foes will rejoice when I fall.
19013005 But I trust in your unfailing love; my heart rejoices in your salvation.
19013006 I will sing the Lord’s praise, for he has been good to me.
19014000 For the director of music. Of David.
19014001 The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good.
19014002 The Lord looks down from heaven on all mankind to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.
19014003 All have turned away, all have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.
19014004 Do all these evildoers know nothing? They devour my people as though eating bread; they never call on the Lord.
19014005 But there they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is present in the company of the righteous.
19014006 You evildoers frustrate the plans of the poor, but the Lord is their refuge.
19014007 Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the Lord restores his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!
19015000 A psalm of David.
19015001 Lord, who may dwell in your sacred tent? Who may live on your holy mountain?
19015002 The one whose walk is blameless, who does what is righteous, who speaks the truth from their heart;
19015003 whose tongue utters no slander, who does no wrong to a neighbor, and casts no slur on others;
19015004 who despises a vile person but honors those who fear the Lord; who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and does not change their mind;
19015005 who lends money to the poor without interest; who does not accept a bribe against the innocent. Whoever does these things will never be shaken.
19016000 A miktam of David.
19016001 Keep me safe, my God, for in you I take refuge.
19016002 I say to the Lord, “You are my Lord; apart from you I have no good thing.”
19016003 I say of the holy people who are in the land, “They are the noble ones in whom is all my delight.”
19016004 Those who run after other gods will suffer more and more. I will not pour out libations of blood to such gods or take up their names on my lips.
19016005 Lord, you alone are my portion and my cup; you make my lot secure.
19016006 The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; surely I have a delightful inheritance.
19016007 I will praise the Lord, who counsels me; even at night my heart instructs me.
19016008 I keep my eyes always on the Lord. With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
19016009 Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will rest secure,
19016010 because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, nor will you let your faithful one see decay.
19016011 You make known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.
19017000 A prayer of David.
19017001 Hear me, Lord, my plea is just; listen to my cry. Hear my prayer— it does not rise from deceitful lips.
19017002 Let my vindication come from you; may your eyes see what is right.
19017003 Though you probe my heart, though you examine me at night and test me, you will find that I have planned no evil; my mouth has not transgressed.
19017004 Though people tried to bribe me, I have kept myself from the ways of the violent through what your lips have commanded.
19017005 My steps have held to your paths; my feet have not stumbled.
19017006 I call on you, my God, for you will answer me; turn your ear to me and hear my prayer.
19017007 Show me the wonders of your great love, you who save by your right hand those who take refuge in you from their foes.
19017008 Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings
19017009 from the wicked who are out to destroy me, from my mortal enemies who surround me.
19017010 They close up their callous hearts, and their mouths speak with arrogance.
19017011 They have tracked me down, they now surround me, with eyes alert, to throw me to the ground.
19017012 They are like a lion hungry for prey, like a fierce lion crouching in cover.
19017013 Rise up, Lord, confront them, bring them down; with your sword rescue me from the wicked.
19017014 By your hand save me from such people, Lord, from those of this world whose reward is in this life. May what you have stored up for the wicked fill their bellies; may their children gorge themselves on it, and may there be leftovers for their little ones.
19017015 As for me, I will be vindicated and will see your face; when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness.
19018000 For the director of music. Of David the servant of the Lord. He sang to the Lord the words of this song when the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:
19018001 I love you, Lord, my strength.
19018002 The Lord is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.
19018003 I called to the Lord, who is worthy of praise, and I have been saved from my enemies.
19018004 The cords of death entangled me; the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.
19018005 The cords of the grave coiled around me; the snares of death confronted me.
19018006 In my distress I called to the Lord; I cried to my God for help. From his temple he heard my voice; my cry came before him, into his ears.
19018007 The earth trembled and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains shook; they trembled because he was angry.
19018008 Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it.
19018009 He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under his feet.
19018010 He mounted the cherubim and flew; he soared on the wings of the wind.
19018011 He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him— the dark rain clouds of the sky.
19018012 Out of the brightness of his presence clouds advanced, with hailstones and bolts of lightning.
19018013 The Lord thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded.
19018014 He shot his arrows and scattered the enemy, with great bolts of lightning he routed them.
19018015 The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at your rebuke, Lord, at the blast of breath from your nostrils.
19018016 He reached down from on high and took hold of me; he drew me out of deep waters.
19018017 He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from my foes, who were too strong for me.
19018018 They confronted me in the day of my disaster, but the Lord was my support.
19018019 He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me.
19018020 The Lord has dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.
19018021 For I have kept the ways of the Lord; I am not guilty of turning from my God.
19018022 All his laws are before me; I have not turned away from his decrees.
19018023 I have been blameless before him and have kept myself from sin.
19018024 The Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.
19018025 To the faithful you show yourself faithful, to the blameless you show yourself blameless,
19018026 to the pure you show yourself pure, but to the devious you show yourself shrewd.
19018027 You save the humble but bring low those whose eyes are haughty.
19018028 You, Lord, keep my lamp burning; my God turns my darkness into light.
19018029 With your help I can advance against a troop ; with my God I can scale a wall.
19018030 As for God, his way is perfect: The Lord’s word is flawless; he shields all who take refuge in him.
19018031 For who is God besides the Lord? And who is the Rock except our God?
19018032 It is God who arms me with strength and keeps my way secure.
19018033 He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he causes me to stand on the heights.
19018034 He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
19018035 You make your saving help my shield, and your right hand sustains me; your help has made me great.
19018036 You provide a broad path for my feet, so that my ankles do not give way.
19018037 I pursued my enemies and overtook them; I did not turn back till they were destroyed.
19018038 I crushed them so that they could not rise; they fell beneath my feet.
19018039 You armed me with strength for battle; you humbled my adversaries before me.
19018040 You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed my foes.
19018041 They cried for help, but there was no one to save them— to the Lord, but he did not answer.
19018042 I beat them as fine as windblown dust; I trampled them like mud in the streets.
19018043 You have delivered me from the attacks of the people; you have made me the head of nations. People I did not know now serve me,
19018044 foreigners cower before me; as soon as they hear of me, they obey me.
19018045 They all lose heart; they come trembling from their strongholds.
19018046 The Lord lives! Praise be to my Rock! Exalted be God my Savior!
19018047 He is the God who avenges me, who subdues nations under me,
19018048 who saves me from my enemies. You exalted me above my foes; from a violent man you rescued me.
19018049 Therefore I will praise you, Lord, among the nations; I will sing the praises of your name.
19018050 He gives his king great victories; he shows unfailing love to his anointed, to David and to his descendants forever.
19019000 For the director of music. A psalm of David.
19019001 The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.
19019002 Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge.
19019003 They have no speech, they use no words; no sound is heard from them.
19019004 Yet their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens God has pitched a tent for the sun.
19019005 It is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, like a champion rejoicing to run his course.
19019006 It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other; nothing is deprived of its warmth.
19019007 The law of the Lord is perfect, refreshing the soul. The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple.
19019008 The precepts of the Lord are right, giving joy to the heart. The commands of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the eyes.
19019009 The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever. The decrees of the Lord are firm, and all of them are righteous.
19019010 They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the honeycomb.
19019011 By them your servant is warned; in keeping them there is great reward.
19019012 But who can discern their own errors? Forgive my hidden faults.
19019013 Keep your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then I will be blameless, innocent of great transgression.
19019014 May these words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.
19020000 For the director of music. A psalm of David.
19020001 May the Lord answer you when you are in distress; may the name of the God of Jacob protect you.
19020002 May he send you help from the sanctuary and grant you support from Zion.
19020003 May he remember all your sacrifices and accept your burnt offerings.
19020004 May he give you the desire of your heart and make all your plans succeed.
19020005 May we shout for joy over your victory and lift up our banners in the name of our God. May the Lord grant all your requests.
19020006 Now this I know: The Lord gives victory to his anointed. He answers him from his heavenly sanctuary with the victorious power of his right hand.
19020007 Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God.
19020008 They are brought to their knees and fall, but we rise up and stand firm.
19020009 Lord, give victory to the king! Answer us when we call!
19021000 For the director of music. A psalm of David.
19021001 The king rejoices in your strength, Lord. How great is his joy in the victories you give!
19021002 You have granted him his heart’s desire and have not withheld the request of his lips.
19021003 You came to greet him with rich blessings and placed a crown of pure gold on his head.
19021004 He asked you for life, and you gave it to him— length of days, for ever and ever.
19021005 Through the victories you gave, his glory is great; you have bestowed on him splendor and majesty.
19021006 Surely you have granted him unending blessings and made him glad with the joy of your presence.
19021007 For the king trusts in the Lord; through the unfailing love of the Most High he will not be shaken.
19021008 Your hand will lay hold on all your enemies; your right hand will seize your foes.
19021009 When you appear for battle, you will burn them up as in a blazing furnace. The Lord will swallow them up in his wrath, and his fire will consume them.
19021010 You will destroy their descendants from the earth, their posterity from mankind.
19021011 Though they plot evil against you and devise wicked schemes, they cannot succeed.
19021012 You will make them turn their backs when you aim at them with drawn bow.
19021013 Be exalted in your strength, Lord; we will sing and praise your might.
19022000 For the director of music. To the tune of “The Doe of the Morning.” A psalm of David.
19022001 My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far from my cries of anguish?
19022002 My God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer, by night, but I find no rest.
19022003 Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One; you are the one Israel praises.
19022004 In you our ancestors put their trust; they trusted and you delivered them.
19022005 To you they cried out and were saved; in you they trusted and were not put to shame.
19022006 But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by everyone, despised by the people.
19022007 All who see me mock me; they hurl insults, shaking their heads.
19022008 “He trusts in the Lord,” they say, “let the Lord rescue him. Let him deliver him, since he delights in him.”
19022009 Yet you brought me out of the womb; you made me trust in you, even at my mother’s breast.
19022010 From birth I was cast on you; from my mother’s womb you have been my God.
19022011 Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help.
19022012 Many bulls surround me; strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.
19022013 Roaring lions that tear their prey open their mouths wide against me.
19022014 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart has turned to wax; it has melted within me.
19022015 My mouth is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; you lay me in the dust of death.
19022016 Dogs surround me, a pack of villains encircles me; they pierce my hands and my feet.
19022017 All my bones are on display; people stare and gloat over me.
19022018 They divide my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment.
19022019 But you, Lord, do not be far from me. You are my strength; come quickly to help me.
19022020 Deliver me from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dogs.
19022021 Rescue me from the mouth of the lions; save me from the horns of the wild oxen.
19022022 I will declare your name to my people; in the assembly I will praise you.
19022023 You who fear the Lord, praise him! All you descendants of Jacob, honor him! Revere him, all you descendants of Israel!
19022024 For he has not despised or scorned the suffering of the afflicted one; he has not hidden his face from him but has listened to his cry for help.
19022025 From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly; before those who fear you I will fulfill my vows.
19022026 The poor will eat and be satisfied; those who seek the Lord will praise him— may your hearts live forever!
19022027 All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the Lord, and all the families of the nations will bow down before him,
19022028 for dominion belongs to the Lord and he rules over the nations.
19022029 All the rich of the earth will feast and worship; all who go down to the dust will kneel before him— those who cannot keep themselves alive.
19022030 Posterity will serve him; future generations will be told about the Lord.
19022031 They will proclaim his righteousness, declaring to a people yet unborn: He has done it!
19023000 A psalm of David.
19023001 The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.
19023002 He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters,
19023003 he refreshes my soul. He guides me along the right paths for his name’s sake.
19023004 Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
19023005 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
19023006 Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
19024000 Of David. A psalm.
19024001 The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it;
19024002 for he founded it on the seas and established it on the waters.
19024003 Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord? Who may stand in his holy place?
19024004 The one who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not trust in an idol or swear by a false god.
19024005 They will receive blessing from the Lord and vindication from God their Savior.
19024006 Such is the generation of those who seek him, who seek your face, God of Jacob.
19024007 Lift up your heads, you gates; be lifted up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.
19024008 Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.
19024009 Lift up your heads, you gates; lift them up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.
19024010 Who is he, this King of glory? The Lord Almighty— he is the King of glory.
19025000 Of David.
19025001 In you, Lord my God, I put my trust.
19025002 I trust in you; do not let me be put to shame, nor let my enemies triumph over me.
19025003 No one who hopes in you will ever be put to shame, but shame will come on those who are treacherous without cause.
19025004 Show me your ways, Lord, teach me your paths.
19025005 Guide me in your truth and teach me, for you are God my Savior, and my hope is in you all day long.
19025006 Remember, Lord, your great mercy and love, for they are from of old.
19025007 Do not remember the sins of my youth and my rebellious ways; according to your love remember me, for you, Lord, are good.
19025008 Good and upright is the Lord; therefore he instructs sinners in his ways.
19025009 He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them his way.
19025010 All the ways of the Lord are loving and faithful toward those who keep the demands of his covenant.
19025011 For the sake of your name, Lord, forgive my iniquity, though it is great.
19025012 Who, then, are those who fear the Lord? He will instruct them in the ways they should choose.
19025013 They will spend their days in prosperity, and their descendants will inherit the land.
19025014 The Lord confides in those who fear him; he makes his covenant known to them.
19025015 My eyes are ever on the Lord, for only he will release my feet from the snare.
19025016 Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted.
19025017 Relieve the troubles of my heart and free me from my anguish.
19025018 Look on my affliction and my distress and take away all my sins.
19025019 See how numerous are my enemies and how fiercely they hate me!
19025020 Guard my life and rescue me; do not let me be put to shame, for I take refuge in you.
19025021 May integrity and uprightness protect me, because my hope, Lord, is in you.
19025022 Deliver Israel, O God, from all their troubles!
19026000 Of David.
19026001 Vindicate me, Lord, for I have led a blameless life; I have trusted in the Lord and have not faltered.
19026002 Test me, Lord, and try me, examine my heart and my mind;
19026003 for I have always been mindful of your unfailing love and have lived in reliance on your faithfulness.
19026004 I do not sit with the deceitful, nor do I associate with hypocrites.
19026005 I abhor the assembly of evildoers and refuse to sit with the wicked.
19026006 I wash my hands in innocence, and go about your altar, Lord,
19026007 proclaiming aloud your praise and telling of all your wonderful deeds.
19026008 Lord, I love the house where you live, the place where your glory dwells.
19026009 Do not take away my soul along with sinners, my life with those who are bloodthirsty,
19026010 in whose hands are wicked schemes, whose right hands are full of bribes.
19026011 I lead a blameless life; deliver me and be merciful to me.
19026012 My feet stand on level ground; in the great congregation I will praise the Lord.
19027000 Of David.
19027001 The Lord is my light and my salvation— whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life— of whom shall I be afraid?
19027002 When the wicked advance against me to devour me, it is my enemies and my foes who will stumble and fall.
19027003 Though an army besiege me, my heart will not fear; though war break out against me, even then I will be confident.
19027004 One thing I ask from the Lord, this only do I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze on the beauty of the Lord and to seek him in his temple.
19027005 For in the day of trouble he will keep me safe in his dwelling; he will hide me in the shelter of his sacred tent and set me high upon a rock.
19027006 Then my head will be exalted above the enemies who surround me; at his sacred tent I will sacrifice with shouts of joy; I will sing and make music to the Lord.
19027007 Hear my voice when I call, Lord; be merciful to me and answer me.
19027008 My heart says of you, “Seek his face!” Your face, Lord, I will seek.
19027009 Do not hide your face from me, do not turn your servant away in anger; you have been my helper. Do not reject me or forsake me, God my Savior.
19027010 Though my father and mother forsake me, the Lord will receive me.
19027011 Teach me your way, Lord; lead me in a straight path because of my oppressors.
19027012 Do not turn me over to the desire of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, spouting malicious accusations.
19027013 I remain confident of this: I will see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.
19027014 Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord.
19028000 Of David.
19028001 To you, Lord, I call; you are my Rock, do not turn a deaf ear to me. For if you remain silent, I will be like those who go down to the pit.
19028002 Hear my cry for mercy as I call to you for help, as I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place.
19028003 Do not drag me away with the wicked, with those who do evil, who speak cordially with their neighbors but harbor malice in their hearts.
19028004 Repay them for their deeds and for their evil work; repay them for what their hands have done and bring back on them what they deserve.
19028005 Because they have no regard for the deeds of the Lord and what his hands have done, he will tear them down and never build them up again.
19028006 Praise be to the Lord, for he has heard my cry for mercy.
19028007 The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and he helps me. My heart leaps for joy, and with my song I praise him.
19028008 The Lord is the strength of his people, a fortress of salvation for his anointed one.
19028009 Save your people and bless your inheritance; be their shepherd and carry them forever.
19029000 A psalm of David.
19029001 Ascribe to the Lord, you heavenly beings, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
19029002 Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name; worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness.
19029003 The voice of the Lord is over the waters; the God of glory thunders, the Lord thunders over the mighty waters.
19029004 The voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is majestic.
19029005 The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars; the Lord breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.
19029006 He makes Lebanon leap like a calf, Sirion like a young wild ox.
19029007 The voice of the Lord strikes with flashes of lightning.
19029008 The voice of the Lord shakes the desert; the Lord shakes the Desert of Kadesh.
19029009 The voice of the Lord twists the oaks and strips the forests bare. And in his temple all cry, “Glory!”
19029010 The Lord sits enthroned over the flood; the Lord is enthroned as King forever.
19029011 The Lord gives strength to his people; the Lord blesses his people with peace.
19030000 A psalm. A song. For the dedication of the temple. Of David.
19030001 I will exalt you, Lord, for you lifted me out of the depths and did not let my enemies gloat over me.
19030002 Lord my God, I called to you for help, and you healed me.
19030003 You, Lord, brought me up from the realm of the dead; you spared me from going down to the pit.
19030004 Sing the praises of the Lord, you his faithful people; praise his holy name.
19030005 For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.
19030006 When I felt secure, I said, “I will never be shaken.”
19030007 Lord, when you favored me, you made my royal mountain stand firm; but when you hid your face, I was dismayed.
19030008 To you, Lord, I called; to the Lord I cried for mercy:
19030009 “What is gained if I am silenced, if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it proclaim your faithfulness?
19030010 Hear, Lord, and be merciful to me; Lord, be my help.”
19030011 You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,
19030012 that my heart may sing your praises and not be silent. Lord my God, I will praise you forever.
19031000 For the director of music. A psalm of David.
19031001 In you, Lord, I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame; deliver me in your righteousness.
19031002 Turn your ear to me, come quickly to my rescue; be my rock of refuge, a strong fortress to save me.
19031003 Since you are my rock and my fortress, for the sake of your name lead and guide me.
19031004 Keep me free from the trap that is set for me, for you are my refuge.
19031005 Into your hands I commit my spirit; deliver me, Lord, my faithful God.
19031006 I hate those who cling to worthless idols; as for me, I trust in the Lord.
19031007 I will be glad and rejoice in your love, for you saw my affliction and knew the anguish of my soul.
19031008 You have not given me into the hands of the enemy but have set my feet in a spacious place.
19031009 Be merciful to me, Lord, for I am in distress; my eyes grow weak with sorrow, my soul and body with grief.
19031010 My life is consumed by anguish and my years by groaning; my strength fails because of my affliction, and my bones grow weak.
19031011 Because of all my enemies, I am the utter contempt of my neighbors and an object of dread to my closest friends— those who see me on the street flee from me.
19031012 I am forgotten as though I were dead; I have become like broken pottery.
19031013 For I hear many whispering, “Terror on every side!” They conspire against me and plot to take my life.
19031014 But I trust in you, Lord; I say, “You are my God.”
19031015 My times are in your hands; deliver me from the hands of my enemies, from those who pursue me.
19031016 Let your face shine on your servant; save me in your unfailing love.
19031017 Let me not be put to shame, Lord, for I have cried out to you; but let the wicked be put to shame and be silent in the realm of the dead.
19031018 Let their lying lips be silenced, for with pride and contempt they speak arrogantly against the righteous.
19031019 How abundant are the good things that you have stored up for those who fear you, that you bestow in the sight of all, on those who take refuge in you.
19031020 In the shelter of your presence you hide them from all human intrigues; you keep them safe in your dwelling from accusing tongues.
19031021 Praise be to the Lord, for he showed me the wonders of his love when I was in a city under siege.
19031022 In my alarm I said, “I am cut off from your sight!” Yet you heard my cry for mercy when I called to you for help.
19031023 Love the Lord, all his faithful people! The Lord preserves those who are true to him, but the proud he pays back in full.
19031024 Be strong and take heart, all you who hope in the Lord.
19032000 Of David. A maskil.
19032001 Blessed is the one whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.
19032002 Blessed is the one whose sin the Lord does not count against them and in whose spirit is no deceit.
19032003 When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.
19032004 For day and night your hand was heavy on me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer.
19032005 Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the Lord.” And you forgave the guilt of my sin.
19032006 Therefore let all the faithful pray to you while you may be found; surely the rising of the mighty waters will not reach them.
19032007 You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance.
19032008 I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my loving eye on you.
19032009 Do not be like the horse or the mule, which have no understanding but must be controlled by bit and bridle or they will not come to you.
19032010 Many are the woes of the wicked, but the Lord’s unfailing love surrounds the one who trusts in him.
19032011 Rejoice in the Lord and be glad, you righteous; sing, all you who are upright in heart!
19033001 Sing joyfully to the Lord, you righteous; it is fitting for the upright to praise him.
19033002 Praise the Lord with the harp; make music to him on the ten-stringed lyre.
19033003 Sing to him a new song; play skillfully, and shout for joy.
19033004 For the word of the Lord is right and true; he is faithful in all he does.
19033005 The Lord loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of his unfailing love.
19033006 By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth.
19033007 He gathers the waters of the sea into jars ; he puts the deep into storehouses.
19033008 Let all the earth fear the Lord; let all the people of the world revere him.
19033009 For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm.
19033010 The Lord foils the plans of the nations; he thwarts the purposes of the peoples.
19033011 But the plans of the Lord stand firm forever, the purposes of his heart through all generations.
19033012 Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, the people he chose for his inheritance.
19033013 From heaven the Lord looks down and sees all mankind;
19033014 from his dwelling place he watches all who live on earth—
19033015 he who forms the hearts of all, who considers everything they do.
19033016 No king is saved by the size of his army; no warrior escapes by his great strength.
19033017 A horse is a vain hope for deliverance; despite all its great strength it cannot save.
19033018 But the eyes of the Lord are on those who fear him, on those whose hope is in his unfailing love,
19033019 to deliver them from death and keep them alive in famine.
19033020 We wait in hope for the Lord; he is our help and our shield.
19033021 In him our hearts rejoice, for we trust in his holy name.
19033022 May your unfailing love be with us, Lord, even as we put our hope in you.
19034000 Of David. When he pretended to be insane before Abimelek, who drove him away, and he left.
19034001 I will extol the Lord at all times; his praise will always be on my lips.
19034002 I will glory in the Lord; let the afflicted hear and rejoice.
19034003 Glorify the Lord with me; let us exalt his name together.
19034004 I sought the Lord, and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears.
19034005 Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame.
19034006 This poor man called, and the Lord heard him; he saved him out of all his troubles.
19034007 The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him, and he delivers them.
19034008 Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the one who takes refuge in him.
19034009 Fear the Lord, you his holy people, for those who fear him lack nothing.
19034010 The lions may grow weak and hungry, but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.
19034011 Come, my children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
19034012 Whoever of you loves life and desires to see many good days,
19034013 keep your tongue from evil and your lips from telling lies.
19034014 Turn from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.
19034015 The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are attentive to their cry;
19034016 but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to blot out their name from the earth.
19034017 The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them; he delivers them from all their troubles.
19034018 The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
19034019 The righteous person may have many troubles, but the Lord delivers him from them all;
19034020 he protects all his bones, not one of them will be broken.
19034021 Evil will slay the wicked; the foes of the righteous will be condemned.
19034022 The Lord will rescue his servants; no one who takes refuge in him will be condemned.
19035000 Of David.
19035001 Contend, Lord, with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me.
19035002 Take up shield and armor; arise and come to my aid.
19035003 Brandish spear and javelin against those who pursue me. Say to me, “I am your salvation.”
19035004 May those who seek my life be disgraced and put to shame; may those who plot my ruin be turned back in dismay.
19035005 May they be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the Lord driving them away;
19035006 may their path be dark and slippery, with the angel of the Lord pursuing them.
19035007 Since they hid their net for me without cause and without cause dug a pit for me,
19035008 may ruin overtake them by surprise— may the net they hid entangle them, may they fall into the pit, to their ruin.
19035009 Then my soul will rejoice in the Lord and delight in his salvation.
19035010 My whole being will exclaim, “Who is like you, Lord? You rescue the poor from those too strong for them, the poor and needy from those who rob them.”
19035011 Ruthless witnesses come forward; they question me on things I know nothing about.
19035012 They repay me evil for good and leave me like one bereaved.
19035013 Yet when they were ill, I put on sackcloth and humbled myself with fasting. When my prayers returned to me unanswered,
19035014 I went about mourning as though for my friend or brother. I bowed my head in grief as though weeping for my mother.
19035015 But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee; assailants gathered against me without my knowledge. They slandered me without ceasing.
19035016 Like the ungodly they maliciously mocked; they gnashed their teeth at me.
19035017 How long, Lord, will you look on? Rescue me from their ravages, my precious life from these lions.
19035018 I will give you thanks in the great assembly; among the throngs I will praise you.
19035019 Do not let those gloat over me who are my enemies without cause; do not let those who hate me without reason maliciously wink the eye.
19035020 They do not speak peaceably, but devise false accusations against those who live quietly in the land.
19035021 They sneer at me and say, “Aha! Aha! With our own eyes we have seen it.”
19035022 Lord, you have seen this; do not be silent. Do not be far from me, Lord.
19035023 Awake, and rise to my defense! Contend for me, my God and Lord.
19035024 Vindicate me in your righteousness, Lord my God; do not let them gloat over me.
19035025 Do not let them think, “Aha, just what we wanted!” or say, “We have swallowed him up.”
19035026 May all who gloat over my distress be put to shame and confusion; may all who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and disgrace.
19035027 May those who delight in my vindication shout for joy and gladness; may they always say, “The Lord be exalted, who delights in the well-being of his servant.”
19035028 My tongue will proclaim your righteousness, your praises all day long.
19036000 For the director of music. Of David the servant of the Lord.
19036001 I have a message from God in my heart concerning the sinfulness of the wicked: There is no fear of God before their eyes.
19036002 In their own eyes they flatter themselves too much to detect or hate their sin.
19036003 The words of their mouths are wicked and deceitful; they fail to act wisely or do good.
19036004 Even on their beds they plot evil; they commit themselves to a sinful course and do not reject what is wrong.
19036005 Your love, Lord, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to the skies.
19036006 Your righteousness is like the highest mountains, your justice like the great deep. You, Lord, preserve both people and animals.
19036007 How priceless is your unfailing love, O God! People take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
19036008 They feast on the abundance of your house; you give them drink from your river of delights.
19036009 For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.
19036010 Continue your love to those who know you, your righteousness to the upright in heart.
19036011 May the foot of the proud not come against me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.
19036012 See how the evildoers lie fallen— thrown down, not able to rise!
19037000 Of David.
19037001 Do not fret because of those who are evil or be envious of those who do wrong;
19037002 for like the grass they will soon wither, like green plants they will soon die away.
19037003 Trust in the Lord and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.
19037004 Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart.
19037005 Commit your way to the Lord; trust in him and he will do this:
19037006 He will make your righteous reward shine like the dawn, your vindication like the noonday sun.
19037007 Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him; do not fret when people succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes.
19037008 Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret—it leads only to evil.
19037009 For those who are evil will be destroyed, but those who hope in the Lord will inherit the land.
19037010 A little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found.
19037011 But the meek will inherit the land and enjoy peace and prosperity.
19037012 The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them;
19037013 but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming.
19037014 The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose ways are upright.
19037015 But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken.
19037016 Better the little that the righteous have than the wealth of many wicked;
19037017 for the power of the wicked will be broken, but the Lord upholds the righteous.
19037018 The blameless spend their days under the Lord’s care, and their inheritance will endure forever.
19037019 In times of disaster they will not wither; in days of famine they will enjoy plenty.
19037020 But the wicked will perish: Though the Lord’s enemies are like the flowers of the field, they will be consumed, they will go up in smoke.
19037021 The wicked borrow and do not repay, but the righteous give generously;
19037022 those the Lord blesses will inherit the land, but those he curses will be destroyed.
19037023 The Lord makes firm the steps of the one who delights in him;
19037024 though he may stumble, he will not fall, for the Lord upholds him with his hand.
19037025 I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread.
19037026 They are always generous and lend freely; their children will be a blessing.
19037027 Turn from evil and do good; then you will dwell in the land forever.
19037028 For the Lord loves the just and will not forsake his faithful ones. Wrongdoers will be completely destroyed ; the offspring of the wicked will perish.
19037029 The righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever.
19037030 The mouths of the righteous utter wisdom, and their tongues speak what is just.
19037031 The law of their God is in their hearts; their feet do not slip.
19037032 The wicked lie in wait for the righteous, intent on putting them to death;
19037033 but the Lord will not leave them in the power of the wicked or let them be condemned when brought to trial.
19037034 Hope in the Lord and keep his way. He will exalt you to inherit the land; when the wicked are destroyed, you will see it.
19037035 I have seen a wicked and ruthless man flourishing like a luxuriant native tree,
19037036 but he soon passed away and was no more; though I looked for him, he could not be found.
19037037 Consider the blameless, observe the upright; a future awaits those who seek peace.
19037038 But all sinners will be destroyed; there will be no future for the wicked.
19037039 The salvation of the righteous comes from the Lord; he is their stronghold in time of trouble.
19037040 The Lord helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him.
19038000 A psalm of David. A petition.
19038001 Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.
19038002 Your arrows have pierced me, and your hand has come down on me.
19038003 Because of your wrath there is no health in my body; there is no soundness in my bones because of my sin.
19038004 My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear.
19038005 My wounds fester and are loathsome because of my sinful folly.
19038006 I am bowed down and brought very low; all day long I go about mourning.
19038007 My back is filled with searing pain; there is no health in my body.
19038008 I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart.
19038009 All my longings lie open before you, Lord; my sighing is not hidden from you.
19038010 My heart pounds, my strength fails me; even the light has gone from my eyes.
19038011 My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds; my neighbors stay far away.
19038012 Those who want to kill me set their traps, those who would harm me talk of my ruin; all day long they scheme and lie.
19038013 I am like the deaf, who cannot hear, like the mute, who cannot speak;
19038014 I have become like one who does not hear, whose mouth can offer no reply.
19038015 Lord, I wait for you; you will answer, Lord my God.
19038016 For I said, “Do not let them gloat or exalt themselves over me when my feet slip.”
19038017 For I am about to fall, and my pain is ever with me.
19038018 I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin.
19038019 Many have become my enemies without cause ; those who hate me without reason are numerous.
19038020 Those who repay my good with evil lodge accusations against me, though I seek only to do what is good.
19038021 Lord, do not forsake me; do not be far from me, my God.
19038022 Come quickly to help me, my Lord and my Savior.
19039000 For the director of music. For Jeduthun. A psalm of David.
19039001 I said, “I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin; I will put a muzzle on my mouth while in the presence of the wicked.”
19039002 So I remained utterly silent, not even saying anything good. But my anguish increased;
19039003 my heart grew hot within me. While I meditated, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue:
19039004 “Show me, Lord, my life’s end and the number of my days; let me know how fleeting my life is.
19039005 You have made my days a mere handbreadth; the span of my years is as nothing before you. Everyone is but a breath, even those who seem secure.
19039006 “Surely everyone goes around like a mere phantom; in vain they rush about, heaping up wealth without knowing whose it will finally be.
19039007 “But now, Lord, what do I look for? My hope is in you.
19039008 Save me from all my transgressions; do not make me the scorn of fools.
19039009 I was silent; I would not open my mouth, for you are the one who has done this.
19039010 Remove your scourge from me; I am overcome by the blow of your hand.
19039011 When you rebuke and discipline anyone for their sin, you consume their wealth like a moth— surely everyone is but a breath.
19039012 “Hear my prayer, Lord, listen to my cry for help; do not be deaf to my weeping. I dwell with you as a foreigner, a stranger, as all my ancestors were.
19039013 Look away from me, that I may enjoy life again before I depart and am no more.”
19040000 For the director of music. Of David. A psalm.
19040001 I waited patiently for the Lord; he turned to me and heard my cry.
19040002 He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.
19040003 He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear the Lord and put their trust in him.
19040004 Blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord, who does not look to the proud, to those who turn aside to false gods.
19040005 Many, Lord my God, are the wonders you have done, the things you planned for us. None can compare with you; were I to speak and tell of your deeds, they would be too many to declare.
19040006 Sacrifice and offering you did not desire— but my ears you have opened — burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require.
19040007 Then I said, “Here I am, I have come— it is written about me in the scroll.
19040008 I desire to do your will, my God; your law is within my heart.”
19040009 I proclaim your saving acts in the great assembly; I do not seal my lips, Lord, as you know.
19040010 I do not hide your righteousness in my heart; I speak of your faithfulness and your saving help. I do not conceal your love and your faithfulness from the great assembly.
19040011 Do not withhold your mercy from me, Lord; may your love and faithfulness always protect me.
19040012 For troubles without number surround me; my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails within me.
19040013 Be pleased to save me, Lord; come quickly, Lord, to help me.
19040014 May all who want to take my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.
19040015 May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!” be appalled at their own shame.
19040016 But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who long for your saving help always say, “The Lord is great!”
19040017 But as for me, I am poor and needy; may the Lord think of me. You are my help and my deliverer; you are my God, do not delay.
19041000 For the director of music. A psalm of David.
19041001 Blessed are those who have regard for the weak; the Lord delivers them in times of trouble.
19041002 The Lord protects and preserves them— they are counted among the blessed in the land— he does not give them over to the desire of their foes.
19041003 The Lord sustains them on their sickbed and restores them from their bed of illness.
19041004 I said, “Have mercy on me, Lord; heal me, for I have sinned against you.”
19041005 My enemies say of me in malice, “When will he die and his name perish?”
19041006 When one of them comes to see me, he speaks falsely, while his heart gathers slander; then he goes out and spreads it around.
19041007 All my enemies whisper together against me; they imagine the worst for me, saying,
19041008 “A vile disease has afflicted him; he will never get up from the place where he lies.”
19041009 Even my close friend, someone I trusted, one who shared my bread, has turned against me.
19041010 But may you have mercy on me, Lord; raise me up, that I may repay them.
19041011 I know that you are pleased with me, for my enemy does not triumph over me.
19041012 Because of my integrity you uphold me and set me in your presence forever.
19041013 Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.
19042000 For the director of music. A maskil of the Sons of Korah.
19042001 As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, my God.
19042002 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When can I go and meet with God?
19042003 My tears have been my food day and night, while people say to me all day long, “Where is your God?”
19042004 These things I remember as I pour out my soul: how I used to go to the house of God under the protection of the Mighty One with shouts of joy and praise among the festive throng.
19042005 Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.
19042006 My soul is downcast within me; therefore I will remember you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon—from Mount Mizar.
19042007 Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls; all your waves and breakers have swept over me.
19042008 By day the Lord directs his love, at night his song is with me— a prayer to the God of my life.
19042009 I say to God my Rock, “Why have you forgotten me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?”
19042010 My bones suffer mortal agony as my foes taunt me, saying to me all day long, “Where is your God?”
19042011 Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.
19043001 Vindicate me, my God, and plead my cause against an unfaithful nation. Rescue me from those who are deceitful and wicked.
19043002 You are God my stronghold. Why have you rejected me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?
19043003 Send me your light and your faithful care, let them lead me; let them bring me to your holy mountain, to the place where you dwell.
19043004 Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my joy and my delight. I will praise you with the lyre, O God, my God.
19043005 Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.
19044000 For the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. A maskil.
19044001 We have heard it with our ears, O God; our ancestors have told us what you did in their days, in days long ago.
19044002 With your hand you drove out the nations and planted our ancestors; you crushed the peoples and made our ancestors flourish.
19044003 It was not by their sword that they won the land, nor did their arm bring them victory; it was your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face, for you loved them.
19044004 You are my King and my God, who decrees victories for Jacob.
19044005 Through you we push back our enemies; through your name we trample our foes.
19044006 I put no trust in my bow, my sword does not bring me victory;
19044007 but you give us victory over our enemies, you put our adversaries to shame.
19044008 In God we make our boast all day long, and we will praise your name forever.
19044009 But now you have rejected and humbled us; you no longer go out with our armies.
19044010 You made us retreat before the enemy, and our adversaries have plundered us.
19044011 You gave us up to be devoured like sheep and have scattered us among the nations.
19044012 You sold your people for a pittance, gaining nothing from their sale.
19044013 You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, the scorn and derision of those around us.
19044014 You have made us a byword among the nations; the peoples shake their heads at us.
19044015 I live in disgrace all day long, and my face is covered with shame
19044016 at the taunts of those who reproach and revile me, because of the enemy, who is bent on revenge.
19044017 All this came upon us, though we had not forgotten you; we had not been false to your covenant.
19044018 Our hearts had not turned back; our feet had not strayed from your path.
19044019 But you crushed us and made us a haunt for jackals; you covered us over with deep darkness.
19044020 If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god,
19044021 would not God have discovered it, since he knows the secrets of the heart?
19044022 Yet for your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.
19044023 Awake, Lord! Why do you sleep? Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever.
19044024 Why do you hide your face and forget our misery and oppression?
19044025 We are brought down to the dust; our bodies cling to the ground.
19044026 Rise up and help us; rescue us because of your unfailing love.
19045000 For the director of music. To the tune of “Lilies.” Of the Sons of Korah. A maskil. A wedding song.
19045001 My heart is stirred by a noble theme as I recite my verses for the king; my tongue is the pen of a skillful writer.
19045002 You are the most excellent of men and your lips have been anointed with grace, since God has blessed you forever.
19045003 Gird your sword on your side, you mighty one; clothe yourself with splendor and majesty.
19045004 In your majesty ride forth victoriously in the cause of truth, humility and justice; let your right hand achieve awesome deeds.
19045005 Let your sharp arrows pierce the hearts of the king’s enemies; let the nations fall beneath your feet.
19045006 Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom.
19045007 You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.
19045008 All your robes are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia; from palaces adorned with ivory the music of the strings makes you glad.
19045009 Daughters of kings are among your honored women; at your right hand is the royal bride in gold of Ophir.
19045010 Listen, daughter, and pay careful attention: Forget your people and your father’s house.
19045011 Let the king be enthralled by your beauty; honor him, for he is your lord.
19045012 The city of Tyre will come with a gift, people of wealth will seek your favor.
19045013 All glorious is the princess within her chamber; her gown is interwoven with gold.
19045014 In embroidered garments she is led to the king; her virgin companions follow her— those brought to be with her.
19045015 Led in with joy and gladness, they enter the palace of the king.
19045016 Your sons will take the place of your fathers; you will make them princes throughout the land.
19045017 I will perpetuate your memory through all generations; therefore the nations will praise you for ever and ever.
19046000 For the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. According to alamoth. A song.
19046001 God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.
19046002 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea,
19046003 though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.
19046004 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells.
19046005 God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day.
19046006 Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall; he lifts his voice, the earth melts.
19046007 The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.
19046008 Come and see what the Lord has done, the desolations he has brought on the earth.
19046009 He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth. He breaks the bow and shatters the spear; he burns the shields with fire.
19046010 He says, “Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.”
19046011 The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.
19047000 For the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. A psalm.
19047001 Clap your hands, all you nations; shout to God with cries of joy.
19047002 For the Lord Most High is awesome, the great King over all the earth.
19047003 He subdued nations under us, peoples under our feet.
19047004 He chose our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob, whom he loved.
19047005 God has ascended amid shouts of joy, the Lord amid the sounding of trumpets.
19047006 Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises to our King, sing praises.
19047007 For God is the King of all the earth; sing to him a psalm of praise.
19047008 God reigns over the nations; God is seated on his holy throne.
19047009 The nobles of the nations assemble as the people of the God of Abraham, for the kings of the earth belong to God; he is greatly exalted.
19048000 A song. A psalm of the Sons of Korah.
19048001 Great is the Lord, and most worthy of praise, in the city of our God, his holy mountain.
19048002 Beautiful in its loftiness, the joy of the whole earth, like the heights of Zaphon is Mount Zion, the city of the Great King.
19048003 God is in her citadels; he has shown himself to be her fortress.
19048004 When the kings joined forces, when they advanced together,
19048005 they saw her and were astounded; they fled in terror.
19048006 Trembling seized them there, pain like that of a woman in labor.
19048007 You destroyed them like ships of Tarshish shattered by an east wind.
19048008 As we have heard, so we have seen in the city of the Lord Almighty, in the city of our God: God makes her secure forever.
19048009 Within your temple, O God, we meditate on your unfailing love.
19048010 Like your name, O God, your praise reaches to the ends of the earth; your right hand is filled with righteousness.
19048011 Mount Zion rejoices, the villages of Judah are glad because of your judgments.
19048012 Walk about Zion, go around her, count her towers,
19048013 consider well her ramparts, view her citadels, that you may tell of them to the next generation.
19048014 For this God is our God for ever and ever; he will be our guide even to the end.
19049000 For the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. A psalm.
19049001 Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all who live in this world,
19049002 both low and high, rich and poor alike:
19049003 My mouth will speak words of wisdom; the meditation of my heart will give you understanding.
19049004 I will turn my ear to a proverb; with the harp I will expound my riddle:
19049005 Why should I fear when evil days come, when wicked deceivers surround me—
19049006 those who trust in their wealth and boast of their great riches?
19049007 No one can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for them—
19049008 the ransom for a life is costly, no payment is ever enough—
19049009 so that they should live on forever and not see decay.
19049010 For all can see that the wise die, that the foolish and the senseless also perish, leaving their wealth to others.
19049011 Their tombs will remain their houses forever, their dwellings for endless generations, though they had named lands after themselves.
19049012 People, despite their wealth, do not endure; they are like the beasts that perish.
19049013 This is the fate of those who trust in themselves, and of their followers, who approve their sayings.
19049014 They are like sheep and are destined to die; death will be their shepherd (but the upright will prevail over them in the morning). Their forms will decay in the grave, far from their princely mansions.
19049015 But God will redeem me from the realm of the dead; he will surely take me to himself.
19049016 Do not be overawed when others grow rich, when the splendor of their houses increases;
19049017 for they will take nothing with them when they die, their splendor will not descend with them.
19049018 Though while they live they count themselves blessed— and people praise you when you prosper—
19049019 they will join those who have gone before them, who will never again see the light of life.
19049020 People who have wealth but lack understanding are like the beasts that perish.
19050000 A psalm of Asaph.
19050001 The Mighty One, God, the Lord, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to where it sets.
19050002 From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth.
19050003 Our God comes and will not be silent; a fire devours before him, and around him a tempest rages.
19050004 He summons the heavens above, and the earth, that he may judge his people:
19050005 “Gather to me this consecrated people, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”
19050006 And the heavens proclaim his righteousness, for he is a God of justice.
19050007 “Listen, my people, and I will speak; I will testify against you, Israel: I am God, your God.
19050008 I bring no charges against you concerning your sacrifices or concerning your burnt offerings, which are ever before me.
19050009 I have no need of a bull from your stall or of goats from your pens,
19050010 for every animal of the forest is mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills.
19050011 I know every bird in the mountains, and the insects in the fields are mine.
19050012 If I were hungry I would not tell you, for the world is mine, and all that is in it.
19050013 Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?
19050014 “Sacrifice thank offerings to God, fulfill your vows to the Most High,
19050015 and call on me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will honor me.”
19050016 But to the wicked person, God says: “What right have you to recite my laws or take my covenant on your lips?
19050017 You hate my instruction and cast my words behind you.
19050018 When you see a thief, you join with him; you throw in your lot with adulterers.
19050019 You use your mouth for evil and harness your tongue to deceit.
19050020 You sit and testify against your brother and slander your own mother’s son.
19050021 When you did these things and I kept silent, you thought I was exactly like you. But I now arraign you and set my accusations before you.
19050022 “Consider this, you who forget God, or I will tear you to pieces, with no one to rescue you:
19050023 Those who sacrifice thank offerings honor me, and to the blameless I will show my salvation.”
19051000 For the director of music. A psalm of David. When the prophet Nathan came to him after David had committed adultery with Bathsheba.
19051001 Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions.
19051002 Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.
19051003 For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me.
19051004 Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight; so you are right in your verdict and justified when you judge.
19051005 Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.
19051006 Yet you desired faithfulness even in the womb; you taught me wisdom in that secret place.
19051007 Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
19051008 Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones you have crushed rejoice.
19051009 Hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquity.
19051010 Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
19051011 Do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me.
19051012 Restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.
19051013 Then I will teach transgressors your ways, so that sinners will turn back to you.
19051014 Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, you who are God my Savior, and my tongue will sing of your righteousness.
19051015 Open my lips, Lord, and my mouth will declare your praise.
19051016 You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it; you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.
19051017 My sacrifice, O God, is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart you, God, will not despise.
19051018 May it please you to prosper Zion, to build up the walls of Jerusalem.
19051019 Then you will delight in the sacrifices of the righteous, in burnt offerings offered whole; then bulls will be offered on your altar.
19052000 For the director of music. A maskil of David. When Doeg the Edomite had gone to Saul and told him: “David has gone to the house of Ahimelek.”
19052001 Why do you boast of evil, you mighty hero? Why do you boast all day long, you who are a disgrace in the eyes of God?
19052002 You who practice deceit, your tongue plots destruction; it is like a sharpened razor.
19052003 You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than speaking the truth.
19052004 You love every harmful word, you deceitful tongue!
19052005 Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin: He will snatch you up and pluck you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living.
19052006 The righteous will see and fear; they will laugh at you, saying,
19052007 “Here now is the man who did not make God his stronghold but trusted in his great wealth and grew strong by destroying others!”
19052008 But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God; I trust in God’s unfailing love for ever and ever.
19052009 For what you have done I will always praise you in the presence of your faithful people. And I will hope in your name, for your name is good.
19053000 For the director of music. According to mahalath. A maskil of David.
19053001 The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, and their ways are vile; there is no one who does good.
19053002 God looks down from heaven on all mankind to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.
19053003 Everyone has turned away, all have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.
19053004 Do all these evildoers know nothing? They devour my people as though eating bread; they never call on God.
19053005 But there they are, overwhelmed with dread, where there was nothing to dread. God scattered the bones of those who attacked you; you put them to shame, for God despised them.
19053006 Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!
19054000 For the director of music. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David. When the Ziphites had gone to Saul and said, “Is not David hiding among us?”
19054001 Save me, O God, by your name; vindicate me by your might.
19054002 Hear my prayer, O God; listen to the words of my mouth.
19054003 Arrogant foes are attacking me; ruthless people are trying to kill me— people without regard for God.
19054004 Surely God is my help; the Lord is the one who sustains me.
19054005 Let evil recoil on those who slander me; in your faithfulness destroy them.
19054006 I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you; I will praise your name, Lord, for it is good.
19054007 You have delivered me from all my troubles, and my eyes have looked in triumph on my foes.
19055000 For the director of music. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David.
19055001 Listen to my prayer, O God, do not ignore my plea;
19055002 hear me and answer me. My thoughts trouble me and I am distraught
19055003 because of what my enemy is saying, because of the threats of the wicked; for they bring down suffering on me and assail me in their anger.
19055004 My heart is in anguish within me; the terrors of death have fallen on me.
19055005 Fear and trembling have beset me; horror has overwhelmed me.
19055006 I said, “Oh, that I had the wings of a dove! I would fly away and be at rest.
19055007 I would flee far away and stay in the desert;
19055008 I would hurry to my place of shelter, far from the tempest and storm.”
19055009 Lord, confuse the wicked, confound their words, for I see violence and strife in the city.
19055010 Day and night they prowl about on its walls; malice and abuse are within it.
19055011 Destructive forces are at work in the city; threats and lies never leave its streets.
19055012 If an enemy were insulting me, I could endure it; if a foe were rising against me, I could hide.
19055013 But it is you, a man like myself, my companion, my close friend,
19055014 with whom I once enjoyed sweet fellowship at the house of God, as we walked about among the worshipers.
19055015 Let death take my enemies by surprise; let them go down alive to the realm of the dead, for evil finds lodging among them.
19055016 As for me, I call to God, and the Lord saves me.
19055017 Evening, morning and noon I cry out in distress, and he hears my voice.
19055018 He rescues me unharmed from the battle waged against me, even though many oppose me.
19055019 God, who is enthroned from of old, who does not change— he will hear them and humble them, because they have no fear of God.
19055020 My companion attacks his friends; he violates his covenant.
19055021 His talk is smooth as butter, yet war is in his heart; his words are more soothing than oil, yet they are drawn swords.
19055022 Cast your cares on the Lord and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous be shaken.
19055023 But you, God, will bring down the wicked into the pit of decay; the bloodthirsty and deceitful will not live out half their days. But as for me, I trust in you.
19056000 For the director of music. To the tune of “A Dove on Distant Oaks.” Of David. A miktam. When the Philistines had seized him in Gath.
19056001 Be merciful to me, my God, for my enemies are in hot pursuit; all day long they press their attack.
19056002 My adversaries pursue me all day long; in their pride many are attacking me.
19056003 When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.
19056004 In God, whose word I praise— in God I trust and am not afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?
19056005 All day long they twist my words; all their schemes are for my ruin.
19056006 They conspire, they lurk, they watch my steps, hoping to take my life.
19056007 Because of their wickedness do not let them escape; in your anger, God, bring the nations down.
19056008 Record my misery; list my tears on your scroll — are they not in your record?
19056009 Then my enemies will turn back when I call for help. By this I will know that God is for me.
19056010 In God, whose word I praise, in the Lord, whose word I praise—
19056011 in God I trust and am not afraid. What can man do to me?
19056012 I am under vows to you, my God; I will present my thank offerings to you.
19056013 For you have delivered me from death and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.
19057000 For the director of music. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” Of David. A miktam. When he had fled from Saul into the cave.
19057001 Have mercy on me, my God, have mercy on me, for in you I take refuge. I will take refuge in the shadow of your wings until the disaster has passed.
19057002 I cry out to God Most High, to God, who vindicates me.
19057003 He sends from heaven and saves me, rebuking those who hotly pursue me— God sends forth his love and his faithfulness.
19057004 I am in the midst of lions; I am forced to dwell among ravenous beasts— men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.
19057005 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.
19057006 They spread a net for my feet— I was bowed down in distress. They dug a pit in my path— but they have fallen into it themselves.
19057007 My heart, O God, is steadfast, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and make music.
19057008 Awake, my soul! Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.
19057009 I will praise you, Lord, among the nations; I will sing of you among the peoples.
19057010 For great is your love, reaching to the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
19057011 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.
19058000 For the director of music. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” Of David. A miktam.
19058001 Do you rulers indeed speak justly? Do you judge people with equity?
19058002 No, in your heart you devise injustice, and your hands mete out violence on the earth.
19058003 Even from birth the wicked go astray; from the womb they are wayward, spreading lies.
19058004 Their venom is like the venom of a snake, like that of a cobra that has stopped its ears,
19058005 that will not heed the tune of the charmer, however skillful the enchanter may be.
19058006 Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; Lord, tear out the fangs of those lions!
19058007 Let them vanish like water that flows away; when they draw the bow, let their arrows fall short.
19058008 May they be like a slug that melts away as it moves along, like a stillborn child that never sees the sun.
19058009 Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns— whether they be green or dry—the wicked will be swept away.
19058010 The righteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they dip their feet in the blood of the wicked.
19058011 Then people will say, “Surely the righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who judges the earth.”
19059000 For the director of music. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” Of David. A miktam. When Saul had sent men to watch David’s house in order to kill him.
19059001 Deliver me from my enemies, O God; be my fortress against those who are attacking me.
19059002 Deliver me from evildoers and save me from those who are after my blood.
19059003 See how they lie in wait for me! Fierce men conspire against me for no offense or sin of mine, Lord.
19059004 I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me. Arise to help me; look on my plight!
19059005 You, Lord God Almighty, you who are the God of Israel, rouse yourself to punish all the nations; show no mercy to wicked traitors.
19059006 They return at evening, snarling like dogs, and prowl about the city.
19059007 See what they spew from their mouths— the words from their lips are sharp as swords, and they think, “Who can hear us?”
19059008 But you laugh at them, Lord; you scoff at all those nations.
19059009 You are my strength, I watch for you; you, God, are my fortress,
19059010 my God on whom I can rely. God will go before me and will let me gloat over those who slander me.
19059011 But do not kill them, Lord our shield, or my people will forget. In your might uproot them and bring them down.
19059012 For the sins of their mouths, for the words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride. For the curses and lies they utter,
19059013 consume them in your wrath, consume them till they are no more. Then it will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob.
19059014 They return at evening, snarling like dogs, and prowl about the city.
19059015 They wander about for food and howl if not satisfied.
19059016 But I will sing of your strength, in the morning I will sing of your love; for you are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble.
19059017 You are my strength, I sing praise to you; you, God, are my fortress, my God on whom I can rely.
19060000 For the director of music. To the tune of “The Lily of the Covenant.” A miktam of David. For teaching. When he fought Aram Naharaim and Aram Zobah, and when Joab returned and struck down twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
19060001 You have rejected us, God, and burst upon us; you have been angry—now restore us!
19060002 You have shaken the land and torn it open; mend its fractures, for it is quaking.
19060003 You have shown your people desperate times; you have given us wine that makes us stagger.
19060004 But for those who fear you, you have raised a banner to be unfurled against the bow.
19060005 Save us and help us with your right hand, that those you love may be delivered.
19060006 God has spoken from his sanctuary: “In triumph I will parcel out Shechem and measure off the Valley of Sukkoth.
19060007 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah is my scepter.
19060008 Moab is my washbasin, on Edom I toss my sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph.”
19060009 Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
19060010 Is it not you, God, you who have now rejected us and no longer go out with our armies?
19060011 Give us aid against the enemy, for human help is worthless.
19060012 With God we will gain the victory, and he will trample down our enemies.
19061000 For the director of music. With stringed instruments. Of David.
19061001 Hear my cry, O God; listen to my prayer.
19061002 From the ends of the earth I call to you, I call as my heart grows faint; lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
19061003 For you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the foe.
19061004 I long to dwell in your tent forever and take refuge in the shelter of your wings.
19061005 For you, God, have heard my vows; you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.
19061006 Increase the days of the king’s life, his years for many generations.
19061007 May he be enthroned in God’s presence forever; appoint your love and faithfulness to protect him.
19061008 Then I will ever sing in praise of your name and fulfill my vows day after day.
19062000 For the director of music. For Jeduthun. A psalm of David.
19062001 Truly my soul finds rest in God; my salvation comes from him.
19062002 Truly he is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will never be shaken.
19062003 How long will you assault me? Would all of you throw me down— this leaning wall, this tottering fence?
19062004 Surely they intend to topple me from my lofty place; they take delight in lies. With their mouths they bless, but in their hearts they curse.
19062005 Yes, my soul, find rest in God; my hope comes from him.
19062006 Truly he is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will not be shaken.
19062007 My salvation and my honor depend on God ; he is my mighty rock, my refuge.
19062008 Trust in him at all times, you people; pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge.
19062009 Surely the lowborn are but a breath, the highborn are but a lie. If weighed on a balance, they are nothing; together they are only a breath.
19062010 Do not trust in extortion or put vain hope in stolen goods; though your riches increase, do not set your heart on them.
19062011 One thing God has spoken, two things I have heard: “Power belongs to you, God,
19062012 and with you, Lord, is unfailing love”; and, “You reward everyone according to what they have done.”
19063000 A psalm of David. When he was in the Desert of Judah.
19063001 You, God, are my God, earnestly I seek you; I thirst for you, my whole being longs for you, in a dry and parched land where there is no water.
19063002 I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory.
19063003 Because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you.
19063004 I will praise you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands.
19063005 I will be fully satisfied as with the richest of foods; with singing lips my mouth will praise you.
19063006 On my bed I remember you; I think of you through the watches of the night.
19063007 Because you are my help, I sing in the shadow of your wings.
19063008 I cling to you; your right hand upholds me.
19063009 Those who want to kill me will be destroyed; they will go down to the depths of the earth.
19063010 They will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals.
19063011 But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by God will glory in him, while the mouths of liars will be silenced.
19064000 For the director of music. A psalm of David.
19064001 Hear me, my God, as I voice my complaint; protect my life from the threat of the enemy.
19064002 Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from the plots of evildoers.
19064003 They sharpen their tongues like swords and aim cruel words like deadly arrows.
19064004 They shoot from ambush at the innocent; they shoot suddenly, without fear.
19064005 They encourage each other in evil plans, they talk about hiding their snares; they say, “Who will see it ?”
19064006 They plot injustice and say, “We have devised a perfect plan!” Surely the human mind and heart are cunning.
19064007 But God will shoot them with his arrows; they will suddenly be struck down.
19064008 He will turn their own tongues against them and bring them to ruin; all who see them will shake their heads in scorn.
19064009 All people will fear; they will proclaim the works of God and ponder what he has done.
19064010 The righteous will rejoice in the Lord and take refuge in him; all the upright in heart will glory in him!
19065000 For the director of music. A psalm of David. A song.
19065001 Praise awaits you, our God, in Zion; to you our vows will be fulfilled.
19065002 You who answer prayer, to you all people will come.
19065003 When we were overwhelmed by sins, you forgave our transgressions.
19065004 Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts! We are filled with the good things of your house, of your holy temple.
19065005 You answer us with awesome and righteous deeds, God our Savior, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas,
19065006 who formed the mountains by your power, having armed yourself with strength,
19065007 who stilled the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations.
19065008 The whole earth is filled with awe at your wonders; where morning dawns, where evening fades, you call forth songs of joy.
19065009 You care for the land and water it; you enrich it abundantly. The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with grain, for so you have ordained it.
19065010 You drench its furrows and level its ridges; you soften it with showers and bless its crops.
19065011 You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance.
19065012 The grasslands of the wilderness overflow; the hills are clothed with gladness.
19065013 The meadows are covered with flocks and the valleys are mantled with grain; they shout for joy and sing.
19066000 For the director of music. A song. A psalm.
19066001 Shout for joy to God, all the earth!
19066002 Sing the glory of his name; make his praise glorious.
19066003 Say to God, “How awesome are your deeds! So great is your power that your enemies cringe before you.
19066004 All the earth bows down to you; they sing praise to you, they sing the praises of your name.”
19066005 Come and see what God has done, his awesome deeds for mankind!
19066006 He turned the sea into dry land, they passed through the waters on foot— come, let us rejoice in him.
19066007 He rules forever by his power, his eyes watch the nations— let not the rebellious rise up against him.
19066008 Praise our God, all peoples, let the sound of his praise be heard;
19066009 he has preserved our lives and kept our feet from slipping.
19066010 For you, God, tested us; you refined us like silver.
19066011 You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our backs.
19066012 You let people ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but you brought us to a place of abundance.
19066013 I will come to your temple with burnt offerings and fulfill my vows to you—
19066014 vows my lips promised and my mouth spoke when I was in trouble.
19066015 I will sacrifice fat animals to you and an offering of rams; I will offer bulls and goats.
19066016 Come and hear, all you who fear God; let me tell you what he has done for me.
19066017 I cried out to him with my mouth; his praise was on my tongue.
19066018 If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened;
19066019 but God has surely listened and has heard my prayer.
19066020 Praise be to God, who has not rejected my prayer or withheld his love from me!
19067000 For the director of music. With stringed instruments. A psalm. A song.
19067001 May God be gracious to us and bless us and make his face shine on us—
19067002 so that your ways may be known on earth, your salvation among all nations.
19067003 May the peoples praise you, God; may all the peoples praise you.
19067004 May the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you rule the peoples with equity and guide the nations of the earth.
19067005 May the peoples praise you, God; may all the peoples praise you.
19067006 The land yields its harvest; God, our God, blesses us.
19067007 May God bless us still, so that all the ends of the earth will fear him.
19068000 For the director of music. Of David. A psalm. A song.
19068001 May God arise, may his enemies be scattered; may his foes flee before him.
19068002 May you blow them away like smoke— as wax melts before the fire, may the wicked perish before God.
19068003 But may the righteous be glad and rejoice before God; may they be happy and joyful.
19068004 Sing to God, sing in praise of his name, extol him who rides on the clouds ; rejoice before him—his name is the Lord.
19068005 A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows, is God in his holy dwelling.
19068006 God sets the lonely in families, he leads out the prisoners with singing; but the rebellious live in a sun-scorched land.
19068007 When you, God, went out before your people, when you marched through the wilderness,
19068008 the earth shook, the heavens poured down rain, before God, the One of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel.
19068009 You gave abundant showers, O God; you refreshed your weary inheritance.
19068010 Your people settled in it, and from your bounty, God, you provided for the poor.
19068011 The Lord announces the word, and the women who proclaim it are a mighty throng:
19068012 “Kings and armies flee in haste; the women at home divide the plunder.
19068013 Even while you sleep among the sheep pens, the wings of my dove are sheathed with silver, its feathers with shining gold.”
19068014 When the Almighty scattered the kings in the land, it was like snow fallen on Mount Zalmon.
19068015 Mount Bashan, majestic mountain, Mount Bashan, rugged mountain,
19068016 why gaze in envy, you rugged mountain, at the mountain where God chooses to reign, where the Lord himself will dwell forever?
19068017 The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands; the Lord has come from Sinai into his sanctuary.
19068018 When you ascended on high, you took many captives; you received gifts from people, even from the rebellious— that you, Lord God, might dwell there.
19068019 Praise be to the Lord, to God our Savior, who daily bears our burdens.
19068020 Our God is a God who saves; from the Sovereign Lord comes escape from death.
19068021 Surely God will crush the heads of his enemies, the hairy crowns of those who go on in their sins.
19068022 The Lord says, “I will bring them from Bashan; I will bring them from the depths of the sea,
19068023 that your feet may wade in the blood of your foes, while the tongues of your dogs have their share.”
19068024 Your procession, God, has come into view, the procession of my God and King into the sanctuary.
19068025 In front are the singers, after them the musicians; with them are the young women playing the timbrels.
19068026 Praise God in the great congregation; praise the Lord in the assembly of Israel.
19068027 There is the little tribe of Benjamin, leading them, there the great throng of Judah’s princes, and there the princes of Zebulun and of Naphtali.
19068028 Summon your power, God ; show us your strength, our God, as you have done before.
19068029 Because of your temple at Jerusalem kings will bring you gifts.
19068030 Rebuke the beast among the reeds, the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations. Humbled, may the beast bring bars of silver. Scatter the nations who delight in war.
19068031 Envoys will come from Egypt; Cush will submit herself to God.
19068032 Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth, sing praise to the Lord,
19068033 to him who rides across the highest heavens, the ancient heavens, who thunders with mighty voice.
19068034 Proclaim the power of God, whose majesty is over Israel, whose power is in the heavens.
19068035 You, God, are awesome in your sanctuary; the God of Israel gives power and strength to his people. Praise be to God!
19069000 For the director of music. To the tune of “Lilies.” Of David.
19069001 Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck.
19069002 I sink in the miry depths, where there is no foothold. I have come into the deep waters; the floods engulf me.
19069003 I am worn out calling for help; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my God.
19069004 Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head; many are my enemies without cause, those who seek to destroy me. I am forced to restore what I did not steal.
19069005 You, God, know my folly; my guilt is not hidden from you.
19069006 Lord, the Lord Almighty, may those who hope in you not be disgraced because of me; God of Israel, may those who seek you not be put to shame because of me.
19069007 For I endure scorn for your sake, and shame covers my face.
19069008 I am a foreigner to my own family, a stranger to my own mother’s children;
19069009 for zeal for your house consumes me, and the insults of those who insult you fall on me.
19069010 When I weep and fast, I must endure scorn;
19069011 when I put on sackcloth, people make sport of me.
19069012 Those who sit at the gate mock me, and I am the song of the drunkards.
19069013 But I pray to you, Lord, in the time of your favor; in your great love, O God, answer me with your sure salvation.
19069014 Rescue me from the mire, do not let me sink; deliver me from those who hate me, from the deep waters.
19069015 Do not let the floodwaters engulf me or the depths swallow me up or the pit close its mouth over me.
19069016 Answer me, Lord, out of the goodness of your love; in your great mercy turn to me.
19069017 Do not hide your face from your servant; answer me quickly, for I am in trouble.
19069018 Come near and rescue me; deliver me because of my foes.
19069019 You know how I am scorned, disgraced and shamed; all my enemies are before you.
19069020 Scorn has broken my heart and has left me helpless; I looked for sympathy, but there was none, for comforters, but I found none.
19069021 They put gall in my food and gave me vinegar for my thirst.
19069022 May the table set before them become a snare; may it become retribution and a trap.
19069023 May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.
19069024 Pour out your wrath on them; let your fierce anger overtake them.
19069025 May their place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in their tents.
19069026 For they persecute those you wound and talk about the pain of those you hurt.
19069027 Charge them with crime upon crime; do not let them share in your salvation.
19069028 May they be blotted out of the book of life and not be listed with the righteous.
19069029 But as for me, afflicted and in pain— may your salvation, God, protect me.
19069030 I will praise God’s name in song and glorify him with thanksgiving.
19069031 This will please the Lord more than an ox, more than a bull with its horns and hooves.
19069032 The poor will see and be glad— you who seek God, may your hearts live!
19069033 The Lord hears the needy and does not despise his captive people.
19069034 Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and all that move in them,
19069035 for God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah. Then people will settle there and possess it;
19069036 the children of his servants will inherit it, and those who love his name will dwell there.
19070000 For the director of music. Of David. A petition.
19070001 Hasten, O God, to save me; come quickly, Lord, to help me.
19070002 May those who want to take my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.
19070003 May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!” turn back because of their shame.
19070004 But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who long for your saving help always say, “The Lord is great!”
19070005 But as for me, I am poor and needy; come quickly to me, O God. You are my help and my deliverer; Lord, do not delay.
19071001 In you, Lord, I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame.
19071002 In your righteousness, rescue me and deliver me; turn your ear to me and save me.
19071003 Be my rock of refuge, to which I can always go; give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.
19071004 Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of those who are evil and cruel.
19071005 For you have been my hope, Sovereign Lord, my confidence since my youth.
19071006 From birth I have relied on you; you brought me forth from my mother’s womb. I will ever praise you.
19071007 I have become a sign to many; you are my strong refuge.
19071008 My mouth is filled with your praise, declaring your splendor all day long.
19071009 Do not cast me away when I am old; do not forsake me when my strength is gone.
19071010 For my enemies speak against me; those who wait to kill me conspire together.
19071011 They say, “God has forsaken him; pursue him and seize him, for no one will rescue him.”
19071012 Do not be far from me, my God; come quickly, God, to help me.
19071013 May my accusers perish in shame; may those who want to harm me be covered with scorn and disgrace.
19071014 As for me, I will always have hope; I will praise you more and more.
19071015 My mouth will tell of your righteous deeds, of your saving acts all day long— though I know not how to relate them all.
19071016 I will come and proclaim your mighty acts, Sovereign Lord; I will proclaim your righteous deeds, yours alone.
19071017 Since my youth, God, you have taught me, and to this day I declare your marvelous deeds.
19071018 Even when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, my God, till I declare your power to the next generation, your mighty acts to all who are to come.
19071019 Your righteousness, God, reaches to the heavens, you who have done great things. Who is like you, God?
19071020 Though you have made me see troubles, many and bitter, you will restore my life again; from the depths of the earth you will again bring me up.
19071021 You will increase my honor and comfort me once more.
19071022 I will praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my God; I will sing praise to you with the lyre, Holy One of Israel.
19071023 My lips will shout for joy when I sing praise to you— I whom you have delivered.
19071024 My tongue will tell of your righteous acts all day long, for those who wanted to harm me have been put to shame and confusion.
19072000 Of Solomon.
19072001 Endow the king with your justice, O God, the royal son with your righteousness.
19072002 May he judge your people in righteousness, your afflicted ones with justice.
19072003 May the mountains bring prosperity to the people, the hills the fruit of righteousness.
19072004 May he defend the afflicted among the people and save the children of the needy; may he crush the oppressor.
19072005 May he endure as long as the sun, as long as the moon, through all generations.
19072006 May he be like rain falling on a mown field, like showers watering the earth.
19072007 In his days may the righteous flourish and prosperity abound till the moon is no more.
19072008 May he rule from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth.
19072009 May the desert tribes bow before him and his enemies lick the dust.
19072010 May the kings of Tarshish and of distant shores bring tribute to him. May the kings of Sheba and Seba present him gifts.
19072011 May all kings bow down to him and all nations serve him.
19072012 For he will deliver the needy who cry out, the afflicted who have no one to help.
19072013 He will take pity on the weak and the needy and save the needy from death.
19072014 He will rescue them from oppression and violence, for precious is their blood in his sight.
19072015 Long may he live! May gold from Sheba be given him. May people ever pray for him and bless him all day long.
19072016 May grain abound throughout the land; on the tops of the hills may it sway. May the crops flourish like Lebanon and thrive like the grass of the field.
19072017 May his name endure forever; may it continue as long as the sun. Then all nations will be blessed through him, and they will call him blessed.
19072018 Praise be to the Lord God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.
19072019 Praise be to his glorious name forever; may the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen and Amen.
19072020 This concludes the prayers of David son of Jesse.
19073000 A psalm of Asaph.
19073001 Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.
19073002 But as for me, my feet had almost slipped; I had nearly lost my foothold.
19073003 For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
19073004 They have no struggles; their bodies are healthy and strong.
19073005 They are free from common human burdens; they are not plagued by human ills.
19073006 Therefore pride is their necklace; they clothe themselves with violence.
19073007 From their callous hearts comes iniquity ; their evil imaginations have no limits.
19073008 They scoff, and speak with malice; with arrogance they threaten oppression.
19073009 Their mouths lay claim to heaven, and their tongues take possession of the earth.
19073010 Therefore their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance.
19073011 They say, “How would God know? Does the Most High know anything?”
19073012 This is what the wicked are like— always free of care, they go on amassing wealth.
19073013 Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure and have washed my hands in innocence.
19073014 All day long I have been afflicted, and every morning brings new punishments.
19073015 If I had spoken out like that, I would have betrayed your children.
19073016 When I tried to understand all this, it troubled me deeply
19073017 till I entered the sanctuary of God; then I understood their final destiny.
19073018 Surely you place them on slippery ground; you cast them down to ruin.
19073019 How suddenly are they destroyed, completely swept away by terrors!
19073020 They are like a dream when one awakes; when you arise, Lord, you will despise them as fantasies.
19073021 When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered,
19073022 I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before you.
19073023 Yet I am always with you; you hold me by my right hand.
19073024 You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take me into glory.
19073025 Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides you.
19073026 My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
19073027 Those who are far from you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.
19073028 But as for me, it is good to be near God. I have made the Sovereign Lord my refuge; I will tell of all your deeds.
19074000 A maskil of Asaph.
19074001 O God, why have you rejected us forever? Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?
19074002 Remember the nation you purchased long ago, the people of your inheritance, whom you redeemed— Mount Zion, where you dwelt.
19074003 Turn your steps toward these everlasting ruins, all this destruction the enemy has brought on the sanctuary.
19074004 Your foes roared in the place where you met with us; they set up their standards as signs.
19074005 They behaved like men wielding axes to cut through a thicket of trees.
19074006 They smashed all the carved paneling with their axes and hatchets.
19074007 They burned your sanctuary to the ground; they defiled the dwelling place of your Name.
19074008 They said in their hearts, “We will crush them completely!” They burned every place where God was worshiped in the land.
19074009 We are given no signs from God; no prophets are left, and none of us knows how long this will be.
19074010 How long will the enemy mock you, God? Will the foe revile your name forever?
19074011 Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand? Take it from the folds of your garment and destroy them!
19074012 But God is my King from long ago; he brings salvation on the earth.
19074013 It was you who split open the sea by your power; you broke the heads of the monster in the waters.
19074014 It was you who crushed the heads of Leviathan and gave it as food to the creatures of the desert.
19074015 It was you who opened up springs and streams; you dried up the ever-flowing rivers.
19074016 The day is yours, and yours also the night; you established the sun and moon.
19074017 It was you who set all the boundaries of the earth; you made both summer and winter.
19074018 Remember how the enemy has mocked you, Lord, how foolish people have reviled your name.
19074019 Do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts; do not forget the lives of your afflicted people forever.
19074020 Have regard for your covenant, because haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land.
19074021 Do not let the oppressed retreat in disgrace; may the poor and needy praise your name.
19074022 Rise up, O God, and defend your cause; remember how fools mock you all day long.
19074023 Do not ignore the clamor of your adversaries, the uproar of your enemies, which rises continually.
19075000 For the director of music. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A psalm of Asaph. A song.
19075001 We praise you, God, we praise you, for your Name is near; people tell of your wonderful deeds.
19075002 You say, “I choose the appointed time; it is I who judge with equity.
19075003 When the earth and all its people quake, it is I who hold its pillars firm.
19075004 To the arrogant I say, ‘Boast no more,’ and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horns.
19075005 Do not lift your horns against heaven; do not speak so defiantly.’ ”
19075006 No one from the east or the west or from the desert can exalt themselves.
19075007 It is God who judges: He brings one down, he exalts another.
19075008 In the hand of the Lord is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices; he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs.
19075009 As for me, I will declare this forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob,
19075010 who says, “I will cut off the horns of all the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.”
19076000 For the director of music. With stringed instruments. A psalm of Asaph. A song.
19076001 God is renowned in Judah; in Israel his name is great.
19076002 His tent is in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion.
19076003 There he broke the flashing arrows, the shields and the swords, the weapons of war.
19076004 You are radiant with light, more majestic than mountains rich with game.
19076005 The valiant lie plundered, they sleep their last sleep; not one of the warriors can lift his hands.
19076006 At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both horse and chariot lie still.
19076007 It is you alone who are to be feared. Who can stand before you when you are angry?
19076008 From heaven you pronounced judgment, and the land feared and was quiet—
19076009 when you, God, rose up to judge, to save all the afflicted of the land.
19076010 Surely your wrath against mankind brings you praise, and the survivors of your wrath are restrained.
19076011 Make vows to the Lord your God and fulfill them; let all the neighboring lands bring gifts to the One to be feared.
19076012 He breaks the spirit of rulers; he is feared by the kings of the earth.
19077000 For the director of music. For Jeduthun. Of Asaph. A psalm.
19077001 I cried out to God for help; I cried out to God to hear me.
19077002 When I was in distress, I sought the Lord; at night I stretched out untiring hands, and I would not be comforted.
19077003 I remembered you, God, and I groaned; I meditated, and my spirit grew faint.
19077004 You kept my eyes from closing; I was too troubled to speak.
19077005 I thought about the former days, the years of long ago;
19077006 I remembered my songs in the night. My heart meditated and my spirit asked:
19077007 “Will the Lord reject forever? Will he never show his favor again?
19077008 Has his unfailing love vanished forever? Has his promise failed for all time?
19077009 Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has he in anger withheld his compassion?”
19077010 Then I thought, “To this I will appeal: the years when the Most High stretched out his right hand.
19077011 I will remember the deeds of the Lord; yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago.
19077012 I will consider all your works and meditate on all your mighty deeds.”
19077013 Your ways, God, are holy. What god is as great as our God?
19077014 You are the God who performs miracles; you display your power among the peoples.
19077015 With your mighty arm you redeemed your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph.
19077016 The waters saw you, God, the waters saw you and writhed; the very depths were convulsed.
19077017 The clouds poured down water, the heavens resounded with thunder; your arrows flashed back and forth.
19077018 Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind, your lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked.
19077019 Your path led through the sea, your way through the mighty waters, though your footprints were not seen.
19077020 You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
19078000 A maskil of Asaph.
19078001 My people, hear my teaching; listen to the words of my mouth.
19078002 I will open my mouth with a parable; I will utter hidden things, things from of old—
19078003 things we have heard and known, things our ancestors have told us.
19078004 We will not hide them from their descendants; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the Lord, his power, and the wonders he has done.
19078005 He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel, which he commanded our ancestors to teach their children,
19078006 so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children.
19078007 Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands.
19078008 They would not be like their ancestors— a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose hearts were not loyal to God, whose spirits were not faithful to him.
19078009 The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows, turned back on the day of battle;
19078010 they did not keep God’s covenant and refused to live by his law.
19078011 They forgot what he had done, the wonders he had shown them.
19078012 He did miracles in the sight of their ancestors in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.
19078013 He divided the sea and led them through; he made the water stand up like a wall.
19078014 He guided them with the cloud by day and with light from the fire all night.
19078015 He split the rocks in the wilderness and gave them water as abundant as the seas;
19078016 he brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers.
19078017 But they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the wilderness against the Most High.
19078018 They willfully put God to the test by demanding the food they craved.
19078019 They spoke against God; they said, “Can God really spread a table in the wilderness?
19078020 True, he struck the rock, and water gushed out, streams flowed abundantly, but can he also give us bread? Can he supply meat for his people?”
19078021 When the Lord heard them, he was furious; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel,
19078022 for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance.
19078023 Yet he gave a command to the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens;
19078024 he rained down manna for the people to eat, he gave them the grain of heaven.
19078025 Human beings ate the bread of angels; he sent them all the food they could eat.
19078026 He let loose the east wind from the heavens and by his power made the south wind blow.
19078027 He rained meat down on them like dust, birds like sand on the seashore.
19078028 He made them come down inside their camp, all around their tents.
19078029 They ate till they were gorged— he had given them what they craved.
19078030 But before they turned from what they craved, even while the food was still in their mouths,
19078031 God’s anger rose against them; he put to death the sturdiest among them, cutting down the young men of Israel.
19078032 In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; in spite of his wonders, they did not believe.
19078033 So he ended their days in futility and their years in terror.
19078034 Whenever God slew them, they would seek him; they eagerly turned to him again.
19078035 They remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer.
19078036 But then they would flatter him with their mouths, lying to him with their tongues;
19078037 their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant.
19078038 Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath.
19078039 He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.
19078040 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the wasteland!
19078041 Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel.
19078042 They did not remember his power— the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,
19078043 the day he displayed his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region of Zoan.
19078044 He turned their river into blood; they could not drink from their streams.
19078045 He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.
19078046 He gave their crops to the grasshopper, their produce to the locust.
19078047 He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet.
19078048 He gave over their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning.
19078049 He unleashed against them his hot anger, his wrath, indignation and hostility— a band of destroying angels.
19078050 He prepared a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague.
19078051 He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.
19078052 But he brought his people out like a flock; he led them like sheep through the wilderness.
19078053 He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies.
19078054 And so he brought them to the border of his holy land, to the hill country his right hand had taken.
19078055 He drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes.
19078056 But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High; they did not keep his statutes.
19078057 Like their ancestors they were disloyal and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty bow.
19078058 They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols.
19078059 When God heard them, he was furious; he rejected Israel completely.
19078060 He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had set up among humans.
19078061 He sent the ark of his might into captivity, his splendor into the hands of the enemy.
19078062 He gave his people over to the sword; he was furious with his inheritance.
19078063 Fire consumed their young men, and their young women had no wedding songs;
19078064 their priests were put to the sword, and their widows could not weep.
19078065 Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, as a warrior wakes from the stupor of wine.
19078066 He beat back his enemies; he put them to everlasting shame.
19078067 Then he rejected the tents of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;
19078068 but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved.
19078069 He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever.
19078070 He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens;
19078071 from tending the sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel his inheritance.
19078072 And David shepherded them with integrity of heart; with skillful hands he led them.
19079000 A psalm of Asaph.
19079001 O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple, they have reduced Jerusalem to rubble.
19079002 They have left the dead bodies of your servants as food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your own people for the animals of the wild.
19079003 They have poured out blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury the dead.
19079004 We are objects of contempt to our neighbors, of scorn and derision to those around us.
19079005 How long, Lord? Will you be angry forever? How long will your jealousy burn like fire?
19079006 Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the kingdoms that do not call on your name;
19079007 for they have devoured Jacob and devastated his homeland.
19079008 Do not hold against us the sins of past generations; may your mercy come quickly to meet us, for we are in desperate need.
19079009 Help us, God our Savior, for the glory of your name; deliver us and forgive our sins for your name’s sake.
19079010 Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” Before our eyes, make known among the nations that you avenge the outpoured blood of your servants.
19079011 May the groans of the prisoners come before you; with your strong arm preserve those condemned to die.
19079012 Pay back into the laps of our neighbors seven times the contempt they have hurled at you, Lord.
19079013 Then we your people, the sheep of your pasture, will praise you forever; from generation to generation we will proclaim your praise.
19080000 For the director of music. To the tune of “The Lilies of the Covenant.” Of Asaph. A psalm.
19080001 Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock. You who sit enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth
19080002 before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh. Awaken your might; come and save us.
19080003 Restore us, O God; make your face shine on us, that we may be saved.
19080004 How long, Lord God Almighty, will your anger smolder against the prayers of your people?
19080005 You have fed them with the bread of tears; you have made them drink tears by the bowlful.
19080006 You have made us an object of derision to our neighbors, and our enemies mock us.
19080007 Restore us, God Almighty; make your face shine on us, that we may be saved.
19080008 You transplanted a vine from Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it.
19080009 You cleared the ground for it, and it took root and filled the land.
19080010 The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches.
19080011 Its branches reached as far as the Sea, its shoots as far as the River.
19080012 Why have you broken down its walls so that all who pass by pick its grapes?
19080013 Boars from the forest ravage it, and insects from the fields feed on it.
19080014 Return to us, God Almighty! Look down from heaven and see! Watch over this vine,
19080015 the root your right hand has planted, the son you have raised up for yourself.
19080016 Your vine is cut down, it is burned with fire; at your rebuke your people perish.
19080017 Let your hand rest on the man at your right hand, the son of man you have raised up for yourself.
19080018 Then we will not turn away from you; revive us, and we will call on your name.
19080019 Restore us, Lord God Almighty; make your face shine on us, that we may be saved.
19081000 For the director of music. According to gittith. Of Asaph.
19081001 Sing for joy to God our strength; shout aloud to the God of Jacob!
19081002 Begin the music, strike the timbrel, play the melodious harp and lyre.
19081003 Sound the ram’s horn at the New Moon, and when the moon is full, on the day of our festival;
19081004 this is a decree for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
19081005 When God went out against Egypt, he established it as a statute for Joseph. I heard an unknown voice say:
19081006 “I removed the burden from their shoulders; their hands were set free from the basket.
19081007 In your distress you called and I rescued you, I answered you out of a thundercloud; I tested you at the waters of Meribah.
19081008 Hear me, my people, and I will warn you— if you would only listen to me, Israel!
19081009 You shall have no foreign god among you; you shall not worship any god other than me.
19081010 I am the Lord your God, who brought you up out of Egypt. Open wide your mouth and I will fill it.
19081011 “But my people would not listen to me; Israel would not submit to me.
19081012 So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts to follow their own devices.
19081013 “If my people would only listen to me, if Israel would only follow my ways,
19081014 how quickly I would subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their foes!
19081015 Those who hate the Lord would cringe before him, and their punishment would last forever.
19081016 But you would be fed with the finest of wheat; with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.”
19082000 A psalm of Asaph.
19082001 God presides in the great assembly; he renders judgment among the “gods”:
19082002 “How long will you defend the unjust and show partiality to the wicked?
19082003 Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed.
19082004 Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.
19082005 “The ‘gods’ know nothing, they understand nothing. They walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
19082006 “I said, ‘You are “gods”; you are all sons of the Most High.’
19082007 But you will die like mere mortals; you will fall like every other ruler.”
19082008 Rise up, O God, judge the earth, for all the nations are your inheritance.
19083000 A song. A psalm of Asaph.
19083001 O God, do not remain silent; do not turn a deaf ear, do not stand aloof, O God.
19083002 See how your enemies growl, how your foes rear their heads.
19083003 With cunning they conspire against your people; they plot against those you cherish.
19083004 “Come,” they say, “let us destroy them as a nation, so that Israel’s name is remembered no more.”
19083005 With one mind they plot together; they form an alliance against you—
19083006 the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagrites,
19083007 Byblos, Ammon and Amalek, Philistia, with the people of Tyre.
19083008 Even Assyria has joined them to reinforce Lot’s descendants.
19083009 Do to them as you did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon,
19083010 who perished at Endor and became like dung on the ground.
19083011 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
19083012 who said, “Let us take possession of the pasturelands of God.”
19083013 Make them like tumbleweed, my God, like chaff before the wind.
19083014 As fire consumes the forest or a flame sets the mountains ablaze,
19083015 so pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your storm.
19083016 Cover their faces with shame, Lord, so that they will seek your name.
19083017 May they ever be ashamed and dismayed; may they perish in disgrace.
19083018 Let them know that you, whose name is the Lord— that you alone are the Most High over all the earth.
19084000 For the director of music. According to gittith. Of the Sons of Korah. A psalm.
19084001 How lovely is your dwelling place, Lord Almighty!
19084002 My soul yearns, even faints, for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
19084003 Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young— a place near your altar, Lord Almighty, my King and my God.
19084004 Blessed are those who dwell in your house; they are ever praising you.
19084005 Blessed are those whose strength is in you, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage.
19084006 As they pass through the Valley of Baka, they make it a place of springs; the autumn rains also cover it with pools.
19084007 They go from strength to strength, till each appears before God in Zion.
19084008 Hear my prayer, Lord God Almighty; listen to me, God of Jacob.
19084009 Look on our shield, O God; look with favor on your anointed one.
19084010 Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere; I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked.
19084011 For the Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord bestows favor and honor; no good thing does he withhold from those whose walk is blameless.
19084012 Lord Almighty, blessed is the one who trusts in you.
19085000 For the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. A psalm.
19085001 You, Lord, showed favor to your land; you restored the fortunes of Jacob.
19085002 You forgave the iniquity of your people and covered all their sins.
19085003 You set aside all your wrath and turned from your fierce anger.
19085004 Restore us again, God our Savior, and put away your displeasure toward us.
19085005 Will you be angry with us forever? Will you prolong your anger through all generations?
19085006 Will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?
19085007 Show us your unfailing love, Lord, and grant us your salvation.
19085008 I will listen to what God the Lord says; he promises peace to his people, his faithful servants— but let them not turn to folly.
19085009 Surely his salvation is near those who fear him, that his glory may dwell in our land.
19085010 Love and faithfulness meet together; righteousness and peace kiss each other.
19085011 Faithfulness springs forth from the earth, and righteousness looks down from heaven.
19085012 The Lord will indeed give what is good, and our land will yield its harvest.
19085013 Righteousness goes before him and prepares the way for his steps.
19086000 A prayer of David.
19086001 Hear me, Lord, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.
19086002 Guard my life, for I am faithful to you; save your servant who trusts in you. You are my God;
19086003 have mercy on me, Lord, for I call to you all day long.
19086004 Bring joy to your servant, Lord, for I put my trust in you.
19086005 You, Lord, are forgiving and good, abounding in love to all who call to you.
19086006 Hear my prayer, Lord; listen to my cry for mercy.
19086007 When I am in distress, I call to you, because you answer me.
19086008 Among the gods there is none like you, Lord; no deeds can compare with yours.
19086009 All the nations you have made will come and worship before you, Lord; they will bring glory to your name.
19086010 For you are great and do marvelous deeds; you alone are God.
19086011 Teach me your way, Lord, that I may rely on your faithfulness; give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.
19086012 I will praise you, Lord my God, with all my heart; I will glorify your name forever.
19086013 For great is your love toward me; you have delivered me from the depths, from the realm of the dead.
19086014 Arrogant foes are attacking me, O God; ruthless people are trying to kill me— they have no regard for you.
19086015 But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness.
19086016 Turn to me and have mercy on me; show your strength in behalf of your servant; save me, because I serve you just as my mother did.
19086017 Give me a sign of your goodness, that my enemies may see it and be put to shame, for you, Lord, have helped me and comforted me.
19087000 Of the Sons of Korah. A psalm. A song.
19087001 He has founded his city on the holy mountain.
19087002 The Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the other dwellings of Jacob.
19087003 Glorious things are said of you, city of God:
19087004 “I will record Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge me— Philistia too, and Tyre, along with Cush — and will say, ‘This one was born in Zion.’ ”
19087005 Indeed, of Zion it will be said, “This one and that one were born in her, and the Most High himself will establish her.”
19087006 The Lord will write in the register of the peoples: “This one was born in Zion.”
19087007 As they make music they will sing, “All my fountains are in you.”
19088000 A song. A psalm of the Sons of Korah. For the director of music. According to mahalath leannoth. A maskil of Heman the Ezrahite.
19088001 Lord, you are the God who saves me; day and night I cry out to you.
19088002 May my prayer come before you; turn your ear to my cry.
19088003 I am overwhelmed with troubles and my life draws near to death.
19088004 I am counted among those who go down to the pit; I am like one without strength.
19088005 I am set apart with the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom you remember no more, who are cut off from your care.
19088006 You have put me in the lowest pit, in the darkest depths.
19088007 Your wrath lies heavily on me; you have overwhelmed me with all your waves.
19088008 You have taken from me my closest friends and have made me repulsive to them. I am confined and cannot escape;
19088009 my eyes are dim with grief. I call to you, Lord, every day; I spread out my hands to you.
19088010 Do you show your wonders to the dead? Do their spirits rise up and praise you?
19088011 Is your love declared in the grave, your faithfulness in Destruction ?
19088012 Are your wonders known in the place of darkness, or your righteous deeds in the land of oblivion?
19088013 But I cry to you for help, Lord; in the morning my prayer comes before you.
19088014 Why, Lord, do you reject me and hide your face from me?
19088015 From my youth I have suffered and been close to death; I have borne your terrors and am in despair.
19088016 Your wrath has swept over me; your terrors have destroyed me.
19088017 All day long they surround me like a flood; they have completely engulfed me.
19088018 You have taken from me friend and neighbor— darkness is my closest friend.
19089000 A maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite.
19089001 I will sing of the Lord’s great love forever; with my mouth I will make your faithfulness known through all generations.
19089002 I will declare that your love stands firm forever, that you have established your faithfulness in heaven itself.
19089003 You said, “I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn to David my servant,
19089004 ‘I will establish your line forever and make your throne firm through all generations.’ ”
19089005 The heavens praise your wonders, Lord, your faithfulness too, in the assembly of the holy ones.
19089006 For who in the skies above can compare with the Lord? Who is like the Lord among the heavenly beings?
19089007 In the council of the holy ones God is greatly feared; he is more awesome than all who surround him.
19089008 Who is like you, Lord God Almighty? You, Lord, are mighty, and your faithfulness surrounds you.
19089009 You rule over the surging sea; when its waves mount up, you still them.
19089010 You crushed Rahab like one of the slain; with your strong arm you scattered your enemies.
19089011 The heavens are yours, and yours also the earth; you founded the world and all that is in it.
19089012 You created the north and the south; Tabor and Hermon sing for joy at your name.
19089013 Your arm is endowed with power; your hand is strong, your right hand exalted.
19089014 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; love and faithfulness go before you.
19089015 Blessed are those who have learned to acclaim you, who walk in the light of your presence, Lord.
19089016 They rejoice in your name all day long; they celebrate your righteousness.
19089017 For you are their glory and strength, and by your favor you exalt our horn.
19089018 Indeed, our shield belongs to the Lord, our king to the Holy One of Israel.
19089019 Once you spoke in a vision, to your faithful people you said: “I have bestowed strength on a warrior; I have raised up a young man from among the people.
19089020 I have found David my servant; with my sacred oil I have anointed him.
19089021 My hand will sustain him; surely my arm will strengthen him.
19089022 The enemy will not get the better of him; the wicked will not oppress him.
19089023 I will crush his foes before him and strike down his adversaries.
19089024 My faithful love will be with him, and through my name his horn will be exalted.
19089025 I will set his hand over the sea, his right hand over the rivers.
19089026 He will call out to me, ‘You are my Father, my God, the Rock my Savior.’
19089027 And I will appoint him to be my firstborn, the most exalted of the kings of the earth.
19089028 I will maintain my love to him forever, and my covenant with him will never fail.
19089029 I will establish his line forever, his throne as long as the heavens endure.
19089030 “If his sons forsake my law and do not follow my statutes,
19089031 if they violate my decrees and fail to keep my commands,
19089032 I will punish their sin with the rod, their iniquity with flogging;
19089033 but I will not take my love from him, nor will I ever betray my faithfulness.
19089034 I will not violate my covenant or alter what my lips have uttered.
19089035 Once for all, I have sworn by my holiness— and I will not lie to David—
19089036 that his line will continue forever and his throne endure before me like the sun;
19089037 it will be established forever like the moon, the faithful witness in the sky.”
19089038 But you have rejected, you have spurned, you have been very angry with your anointed one.
19089039 You have renounced the covenant with your servant and have defiled his crown in the dust.
19089040 You have broken through all his walls and reduced his strongholds to ruins.
19089041 All who pass by have plundered him; he has become the scorn of his neighbors.
19089042 You have exalted the right hand of his foes; you have made all his enemies rejoice.
19089043 Indeed, you have turned back the edge of his sword and have not supported him in battle.
19089044 You have put an end to his splendor and cast his throne to the ground.
19089045 You have cut short the days of his youth; you have covered him with a mantle of shame.
19089046 How long, Lord? Will you hide yourself forever? How long will your wrath burn like fire?
19089047 Remember how fleeting is my life. For what futility you have created all humanity!
19089048 Who can live and not see death, or who can escape the power of the grave?
19089049 Lord, where is your former great love, which in your faithfulness you swore to David?
19089050 Remember, Lord, how your servant has been mocked, how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the nations,
19089051 the taunts with which your enemies, Lord, have mocked, with which they have mocked every step of your anointed one.
19089052 Praise be to the Lord forever! Amen and Amen.
19090000 A prayer of Moses the man of God.
19090001 Lord, you have been our dwelling place throughout all generations.
19090002 Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God.
19090003 You turn people back to dust, saying, “Return to dust, you mortals.”
19090004 A thousand years in your sight are like a day that has just gone by, or like a watch in the night.
19090005 Yet you sweep people away in the sleep of death— they are like the new grass of the morning:
19090006 In the morning it springs up new, but by evening it is dry and withered.
19090007 We are consumed by your anger and terrified by your indignation.
19090008 You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence.
19090009 All our days pass away under your wrath; we finish our years with a moan.
19090010 Our days may come to seventy years, or eighty, if our strength endures; yet the best of them are but trouble and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away.
19090011 If only we knew the power of your anger! Your wrath is as great as the fear that is your due.
19090012 Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
19090013 Relent, Lord! How long will it be? Have compassion on your servants.
19090014 Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.
19090015 Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen trouble.
19090016 May your deeds be shown to your servants, your splendor to their children.
19090017 May the favor of the Lord our God rest on us; establish the work of our hands for us— yes, establish the work of our hands.
19091001 Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
19091002 I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.”
19091003 Surely he will save you from the fowler’s snare and from the deadly pestilence.
19091004 He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart.
19091005 You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day,
19091006 nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday.
19091007 A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.
19091008 You will only observe with your eyes and see the punishment of the wicked.
19091009 If you say, “The Lord is my refuge,” and you make the Most High your dwelling,
19091010 no harm will overtake you, no disaster will come near your tent.
19091011 For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways;
19091012 they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.
19091013 You will tread on the lion and the cobra; you will trample the great lion and the serpent.
19091014 “Because he loves me,” says the Lord, “I will rescue him; I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name.
19091015 He will call on me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honor him.
19091016 With long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation.”
19092000 A psalm. A song. For the Sabbath day.
19092001 It is good to praise the Lord and make music to your name, O Most High,
19092002 proclaiming your love in the morning and your faithfulness at night,
19092003 to the music of the ten-stringed lyre and the melody of the harp.
19092004 For you make me glad by your deeds, Lord; I sing for joy at what your hands have done.
19092005 How great are your works, Lord, how profound your thoughts!
19092006 Senseless people do not know, fools do not understand,
19092007 that though the wicked spring up like grass and all evildoers flourish, they will be destroyed forever.
19092008 But you, Lord, are forever exalted.
19092009 For surely your enemies, Lord, surely your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered.
19092010 You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox; fine oils have been poured on me.
19092011 My eyes have seen the defeat of my adversaries; my ears have heard the rout of my wicked foes.
19092012 The righteous will flourish like a palm tree, they will grow like a cedar of Lebanon;
19092013 planted in the house of the Lord, they will flourish in the courts of our God.
19092014 They will still bear fruit in old age, they will stay fresh and green,
19092015 proclaiming, “The Lord is upright; he is my Rock, and there is no wickedness in him.”
19093001 The Lord reigns, he is robed in majesty; the Lord is robed in majesty and armed with strength; indeed, the world is established, firm and secure.
19093002 Your throne was established long ago; you are from all eternity.
19093003 The seas have lifted up, Lord, the seas have lifted up their voice; the seas have lifted up their pounding waves.
19093004 Mightier than the thunder of the great waters, mightier than the breakers of the sea— the Lord on high is mighty.
19093005 Your statutes, Lord, stand firm; holiness adorns your house for endless days.
19094001 The Lord is a God who avenges. O God who avenges, shine forth.
19094002 Rise up, Judge of the earth; pay back to the proud what they deserve.
19094003 How long, Lord, will the wicked, how long will the wicked be jubilant?
19094004 They pour out arrogant words; all the evildoers are full of boasting.
19094005 They crush your people, Lord; they oppress your inheritance.
19094006 They slay the widow and the foreigner; they murder the fatherless.
19094007 They say, “The Lord does not see; the God of Jacob takes no notice.”
19094008 Take notice, you senseless ones among the people; you fools, when will you become wise?
19094009 Does he who fashioned the ear not hear? Does he who formed the eye not see?
19094010 Does he who disciplines nations not punish? Does he who teaches mankind lack knowledge?
19094011 The Lord knows all human plans; he knows that they are futile.
19094012 Blessed is the one you discipline, Lord, the one you teach from your law;
19094013 you grant them relief from days of trouble, till a pit is dug for the wicked.
19094014 For the Lord will not reject his people; he will never forsake his inheritance.
19094015 Judgment will again be founded on righteousness, and all the upright in heart will follow it.
19094016 Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will take a stand for me against evildoers?
19094017 Unless the Lord had given me help, I would soon have dwelt in the silence of death.
19094018 When I said, “My foot is slipping,” your unfailing love, Lord, supported me.
19094019 When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought me joy.
19094020 Can a corrupt throne be allied with you— a throne that brings on misery by its decrees?
19094021 The wicked band together against the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.
19094022 But the Lord has become my fortress, and my God the rock in whom I take refuge.
19094023 He will repay them for their sins and destroy them for their wickedness; the Lord our God will destroy them.
19095001 Come, let us sing for joy to the Lord; let us shout aloud to the Rock of our salvation.
19095002 Let us come before him with thanksgiving and extol him with music and song.
19095003 For the Lord is the great God, the great King above all gods.
19095004 In his hand are the depths of the earth, and the mountain peaks belong to him.
19095005 The sea is his, for he made it, and his hands formed the dry land.
19095006 Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker;
19095007 for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture, the flock under his care. Today, if only you would hear his voice,
19095008 “Do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah, as you did that day at Massah in the wilderness,
19095009 where your ancestors tested me; they tried me, though they had seen what I did.
19095010 For forty years I was angry with that generation; I said, ‘They are a people whose hearts go astray, and they have not known my ways.’
19095011 So I declared on oath in my anger, ‘They shall never enter my rest.’ ”
19096001 Sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth.
19096002 Sing to the Lord, praise his name; proclaim his salvation day after day.
19096003 Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among all peoples.
19096004 For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise; he is to be feared above all gods.
19096005 For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made the heavens.
19096006 Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and glory are in his sanctuary.
19096007 Ascribe to the Lord, all you families of nations, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
19096008 Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name; bring an offering and come into his courts.
19096009 Worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness; tremble before him, all the earth.
19096010 Say among the nations, “The Lord reigns.” The world is firmly established, it cannot be moved; he will judge the peoples with equity.
19096011 Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth be glad; let the sea resound, and all that is in it.
19096012 Let the fields be jubilant, and everything in them; let all the trees of the forest sing for joy.
19096013 Let all creation rejoice before the Lord, for he comes, he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in his faithfulness.
19097001 The Lord reigns, let the earth be glad; let the distant shores rejoice.
19097002 Clouds and thick darkness surround him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
19097003 Fire goes before him and consumes his foes on every side.
19097004 His lightning lights up the world; the earth sees and trembles.
19097005 The mountains melt like wax before the Lord, before the Lord of all the earth.
19097006 The heavens proclaim his righteousness, and all peoples see his glory.
19097007 All who worship images are put to shame, those who boast in idols— worship him, all you gods!
19097008 Zion hears and rejoices and the villages of Judah are glad because of your judgments, Lord.
19097009 For you, Lord, are the Most High over all the earth; you are exalted far above all gods.
19097010 Let those who love the Lord hate evil, for he guards the lives of his faithful ones and delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
19097011 Light shines on the righteous and joy on the upright in heart.
19097012 Rejoice in the Lord, you who are righteous, and praise his holy name.
19098000 A psalm.
19098001 Sing to the Lord a new song, for he has done marvelous things; his right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him.
19098002 The Lord has made his salvation known and revealed his righteousness to the nations.
19098003 He has remembered his love and his faithfulness to Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
19098004 Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth, burst into jubilant song with music;
19098005 make music to the Lord with the harp, with the harp and the sound of singing,
19098006 with trumpets and the blast of the ram’s horn— shout for joy before the Lord, the King.
19098007 Let the sea resound, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it.
19098008 Let the rivers clap their hands, let the mountains sing together for joy;
19098009 let them sing before the Lord, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples with equity.
19099001 The Lord reigns, let the nations tremble; he sits enthroned between the cherubim, let the earth shake.
19099002 Great is the Lord in Zion; he is exalted over all the nations.
19099003 Let them praise your great and awesome name— he is holy.
19099004 The King is mighty, he loves justice— you have established equity; in Jacob you have done what is just and right.
19099005 Exalt the Lord our God and worship at his footstool; he is holy.
19099006 Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel was among those who called on his name; they called on the Lord and he answered them.
19099007 He spoke to them from the pillar of cloud; they kept his statutes and the decrees he gave them.
19099008 Lord our God, you answered them; you were to Israel a forgiving God, though you punished their misdeeds.
19099009 Exalt the Lord our God and worship at his holy mountain, for the Lord our God is holy.
19100000 A psalm. For giving grateful praise.
19100001 Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
19100002 Worship the Lord with gladness; come before him with joyful songs.
19100003 Know that the Lord is God. It is he who made us, and we are his ; we are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
19100004 Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to him and praise his name.
19100005 For the Lord is good and his love endures forever; his faithfulness continues through all generations.
19101000 Of David. A psalm.
19101001 I will sing of your love and justice; to you, Lord, I will sing praise.
19101002 I will be careful to lead a blameless life— when will you come to me? I will conduct the affairs of my house with a blameless heart.
19101003 I will not look with approval on anything that is vile. I hate what faithless people do; I will have no part in it.
19101004 The perverse of heart shall be far from me; I will have nothing to do with what is evil.
19101005 Whoever slanders their neighbor in secret, I will put to silence; whoever has haughty eyes and a proud heart, I will not tolerate.
19101006 My eyes will be on the faithful in the land, that they may dwell with me; the one whose walk is blameless will minister to me.
19101007 No one who practices deceit will dwell in my house; no one who speaks falsely will stand in my presence.
19101008 Every morning I will put to silence all the wicked in the land; I will cut off every evildoer from the city of the Lord.
19102000 A prayer of an afflicted person who has grown weak and pours out a lament before the Lord.
19102001 Hear my prayer, Lord; let my cry for help come to you.
19102002 Do not hide your face from me when I am in distress. Turn your ear to me; when I call, answer me quickly.
19102003 For my days vanish like smoke; my bones burn like glowing embers.
19102004 My heart is blighted and withered like grass; I forget to eat my food.
19102005 In my distress I groan aloud and am reduced to skin and bones.
19102006 I am like a desert owl, like an owl among the ruins.
19102007 I lie awake; I have become like a bird alone on a roof.
19102008 All day long my enemies taunt me; those who rail against me use my name as a curse.
19102009 For I eat ashes as my food and mingle my drink with tears
19102010 because of your great wrath, for you have taken me up and thrown me aside.
19102011 My days are like the evening shadow; I wither away like grass.
19102012 But you, Lord, sit enthroned forever; your renown endures through all generations.
19102013 You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show favor to her; the appointed time has come.
19102014 For her stones are dear to your servants; her very dust moves them to pity.
19102015 The nations will fear the name of the Lord, all the kings of the earth will revere your glory.
19102016 For the Lord will rebuild Zion and appear in his glory.
19102017 He will respond to the prayer of the destitute; he will not despise their plea.
19102018 Let this be written for a future generation, that a people not yet created may praise the Lord:
19102019 “The Lord looked down from his sanctuary on high, from heaven he viewed the earth,
19102020 to hear the groans of the prisoners and release those condemned to death.”
19102021 So the name of the Lord will be declared in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem
19102022 when the peoples and the kingdoms assemble to worship the Lord.
19102023 In the course of my life he broke my strength; he cut short my days.
19102024 So I said: “Do not take me away, my God, in the midst of my days; your years go on through all generations.
19102025 In the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.
19102026 They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing you will change them and they will be discarded.
19102027 But you remain the same, and your years will never end.
19102028 The children of your servants will live in your presence; their descendants will be established before you.”
19103000 Of David.
19103001 Praise the Lord, my soul; all my inmost being, praise his holy name.
19103002 Praise the Lord, my soul, and forget not all his benefits—
19103003 who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases,
19103004 who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion,
19103005 who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.
19103006 The Lord works righteousness and justice for all the oppressed.
19103007 He made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the people of Israel:
19103008 The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love.
19103009 He will not always accuse, nor will he harbor his anger forever;
19103010 he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.
19103011 For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him;
19103012 as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
19103013 As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him;
19103014 for he knows how we are formed, he remembers that we are dust.
19103015 The life of mortals is like grass, they flourish like a flower of the field;
19103016 the wind blows over it and it is gone, and its place remembers it no more.
19103017 But from everlasting to everlasting the Lord’s love is with those who fear him, and his righteousness with their children’s children—
19103018 with those who keep his covenant and remember to obey his precepts.
19103019 The Lord has established his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all.
19103020 Praise the Lord, you his angels, you mighty ones who do his bidding, who obey his word.
19103021 Praise the Lord, all his heavenly hosts, you his servants who do his will.
19103022 Praise the Lord, all his works everywhere in his dominion. Praise the Lord, my soul.
19104001 Praise the Lord, my soul. Lord my God, you are very great; you are clothed with splendor and majesty.
19104002 The Lord wraps himself in light as with a garment; he stretches out the heavens like a tent
19104003 and lays the beams of his upper chambers on their waters. He makes the clouds his chariot and rides on the wings of the wind.
19104004 He makes winds his messengers, flames of fire his servants.
19104005 He set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved.
19104006 You covered it with the watery depths as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.
19104007 But at your rebuke the waters fled, at the sound of your thunder they took to flight;
19104008 they flowed over the mountains, they went down into the valleys, to the place you assigned for them.
19104009 You set a boundary they cannot cross; never again will they cover the earth.
19104010 He makes springs pour water into the ravines; it flows between the mountains.
19104011 They give water to all the beasts of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
19104012 The birds of the sky nest by the waters; they sing among the branches.
19104013 He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the land is satisfied by the fruit of his work.
19104014 He makes grass grow for the cattle, and plants for people to cultivate— bringing forth food from the earth:
19104015 wine that gladdens human hearts, oil to make their faces shine, and bread that sustains their hearts.
19104016 The trees of the Lord are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.
19104017 There the birds make their nests; the stork has its home in the junipers.
19104018 The high mountains belong to the wild goats; the crags are a refuge for the hyrax.
19104019 He made the moon to mark the seasons, and the sun knows when to go down.
19104020 You bring darkness, it becomes night, and all the beasts of the forest prowl.
19104021 The lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.
19104022 The sun rises, and they steal away; they return and lie down in their dens.
19104023 Then people go out to their work, to their labor until evening.
19104024 How many are your works, Lord! In wisdom you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.
19104025 There is the sea, vast and spacious, teeming with creatures beyond number— living things both large and small.
19104026 There the ships go to and fro, and Leviathan, which you formed to frolic there.
19104027 All creatures look to you to give them their food at the proper time.
19104028 When you give it to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.
19104029 When you hide your face, they are terrified; when you take away their breath, they die and return to the dust.
19104030 When you send your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the ground.
19104031 May the glory of the Lord endure forever; may the Lord rejoice in his works—
19104032 he who looks at the earth, and it trembles, who touches the mountains, and they smoke.
19104033 I will sing to the Lord all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.
19104034 May my meditation be pleasing to him, as I rejoice in the Lord.
19104035 But may sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more. Praise the Lord, my soul. Praise the Lord.
19105001 Give praise to the Lord, proclaim his name; make known among the nations what he has done.
19105002 Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts.
19105003 Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice.
19105004 Look to the Lord and his strength; seek his face always.
19105005 Remember the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced,
19105006 you his servants, the descendants of Abraham, his chosen ones, the children of Jacob.
19105007 He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
19105008 He remembers his covenant forever, the promise he made, for a thousand generations,
19105009 the covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac.
19105010 He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:
19105011 “To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit.”
19105012 When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers in it,
19105013 they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.
19105014 He allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake he rebuked kings:
19105015 “Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm.”
19105016 He called down famine on the land and destroyed all their supplies of food;
19105017 and he sent a man before them— Joseph, sold as a slave.
19105018 They bruised his feet with shackles, his neck was put in irons,
19105019 till what he foretold came to pass, till the word of the Lord proved him true.
19105020 The king sent and released him, the ruler of peoples set him free.
19105021 He made him master of his household, ruler over all he possessed,
19105022 to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom.
19105023 Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob resided as a foreigner in the land of Ham.
19105024 The Lord made his people very fruitful; he made them too numerous for their foes,
19105025 whose hearts he turned to hate his people, to conspire against his servants.
19105026 He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
19105027 They performed his signs among them, his wonders in the land of Ham.
19105028 He sent darkness and made the land dark— for had they not rebelled against his words?
19105029 He turned their waters into blood, causing their fish to die.
19105030 Their land teemed with frogs, which went up into the bedrooms of their rulers.
19105031 He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.
19105032 He turned their rain into hail, with lightning throughout their land;
19105033 he struck down their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country.
19105034 He spoke, and the locusts came, grasshoppers without number;
19105035 they ate up every green thing in their land, ate up the produce of their soil.
19105036 Then he struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their manhood.
19105037 He brought out Israel, laden with silver and gold, and from among their tribes no one faltered.
19105038 Egypt was glad when they left, because dread of Israel had fallen on them.
19105039 He spread out a cloud as a covering, and a fire to give light at night.
19105040 They asked, and he brought them quail; he fed them well with the bread of heaven.
19105041 He opened the rock, and water gushed out; it flowed like a river in the desert.
19105042 For he remembered his holy promise given to his servant Abraham.
19105043 He brought out his people with rejoicing, his chosen ones with shouts of joy;
19105044 he gave them the lands of the nations, and they fell heir to what others had toiled for—
19105045 that they might keep his precepts and observe his laws. Praise the Lord.
19106001 Praise the Lord. Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever.
19106002 Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the Lord or fully declare his praise?
19106003 Blessed are those who act justly, who always do what is right.
19106004 Remember me, Lord, when you show favor to your people, come to my aid when you save them,
19106005 that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may share in the joy of your nation and join your inheritance in giving praise.
19106006 We have sinned, even as our ancestors did; we have done wrong and acted wickedly.
19106007 When our ancestors were in Egypt, they gave no thought to your miracles; they did not remember your many kindnesses, and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea.
19106008 Yet he saved them for his name’s sake, to make his mighty power known.
19106009 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; he led them through the depths as through a desert.
19106010 He saved them from the hand of the foe; from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them.
19106011 The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived.
19106012 Then they believed his promises and sang his praise.
19106013 But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his plan to unfold.
19106014 In the desert they gave in to their craving; in the wilderness they put God to the test.
19106015 So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease among them.
19106016 In the camp they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the Lord.
19106017 The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it buried the company of Abiram.
19106018 Fire blazed among their followers; a flame consumed the wicked.
19106019 At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped an idol cast from metal.
19106020 They exchanged their glorious God for an image of a bull, which eats grass.
19106021 They forgot the God who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt,
19106022 miracles in the land of Ham and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.
19106023 So he said he would destroy them— had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him to keep his wrath from destroying them.
19106024 Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his promise.
19106025 They grumbled in their tents and did not obey the Lord.
19106026 So he swore to them with uplifted hand that he would make them fall in the wilderness,
19106027 make their descendants fall among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands.
19106028 They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods;
19106029 they aroused the Lord’s anger by their wicked deeds, and a plague broke out among them.
19106030 But Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was checked.
19106031 This was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.
19106032 By the waters of Meribah they angered the Lord, and trouble came to Moses because of them;
19106033 for they rebelled against the Spirit of God, and rash words came from Moses’ lips.
19106034 They did not destroy the peoples as the Lord had commanded them,
19106035 but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs.
19106036 They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.
19106037 They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to false gods.
19106038 They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was desecrated by their blood.
19106039 They defiled themselves by what they did; by their deeds they prostituted themselves.
19106040 Therefore the Lord was angry with his people and abhorred his inheritance.
19106041 He gave them into the hands of the nations, and their foes ruled over them.
19106042 Their enemies oppressed them and subjected them to their power.
19106043 Many times he delivered them, but they were bent on rebellion and they wasted away in their sin.
19106044 Yet he took note of their distress when he heard their cry;
19106045 for their sake he remembered his covenant and out of his great love he relented.
19106046 He caused all who held them captive to show them mercy.
19106047 Save us, Lord our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.
19106048 Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, “Amen!” Praise the Lord.
19107001 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever.
19107002 Let the redeemed of the Lord tell their story— those he redeemed from the hand of the foe,
19107003 those he gathered from the lands, from east and west, from north and south.
19107004 Some wandered in desert wastelands, finding no way to a city where they could settle.
19107005 They were hungry and thirsty, and their lives ebbed away.
19107006 Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.
19107007 He led them by a straight way to a city where they could settle.
19107008 Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind,
19107009 for he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.
19107010 Some sat in darkness, in utter darkness, prisoners suffering in iron chains,
19107011 because they rebelled against God’s commands and despised the plans of the Most High.
19107012 So he subjected them to bitter labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help.
19107013 Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.
19107014 He brought them out of darkness, the utter darkness, and broke away their chains.
19107015 Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind,
19107016 for he breaks down gates of bronze and cuts through bars of iron.
19107017 Some became fools through their rebellious ways and suffered affliction because of their iniquities.
19107018 They loathed all food and drew near the gates of death.
19107019 Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.
19107020 He sent out his word and healed them; he rescued them from the grave.
19107021 Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind.
19107022 Let them sacrifice thank offerings and tell of his works with songs of joy.
19107023 Some went out on the sea in ships; they were merchants on the mighty waters.
19107024 They saw the works of the Lord, his wonderful deeds in the deep.
19107025 For he spoke and stirred up a tempest that lifted high the waves.
19107026 They mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths; in their peril their courage melted away.
19107027 They reeled and staggered like drunkards; they were at their wits’ end.
19107028 Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress.
19107029 He stilled the storm to a whisper; the waves of the sea were hushed.
19107030 They were glad when it grew calm, and he guided them to their desired haven.
19107031 Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind.
19107032 Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people and praise him in the council of the elders.
19107033 He turned rivers into a desert, flowing springs into thirsty ground,
19107034 and fruitful land into a salt waste, because of the wickedness of those who lived there.
19107035 He turned the desert into pools of water and the parched ground into flowing springs;
19107036 there he brought the hungry to live, and they founded a city where they could settle.
19107037 They sowed fields and planted vineyards that yielded a fruitful harvest;
19107038 he blessed them, and their numbers greatly increased, and he did not let their herds diminish.
19107039 Then their numbers decreased, and they were humbled by oppression, calamity and sorrow;
19107040 he who pours contempt on nobles made them wander in a trackless waste.
19107041 But he lifted the needy out of their affliction and increased their families like flocks.
19107042 The upright see and rejoice, but all the wicked shut their mouths.
19107043 Let the one who is wise heed these things and ponder the loving deeds of the Lord.
19108000 A song. A psalm of David.
19108001 My heart, O God, is steadfast; I will sing and make music with all my soul.
19108002 Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.
19108003 I will praise you, Lord, among the nations; I will sing of you among the peoples.
19108004 For great is your love, higher than the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
19108005 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.
19108006 Save us and help us with your right hand, that those you love may be delivered.
19108007 God has spoken from his sanctuary: “In triumph I will parcel out Shechem and measure off the Valley of Sukkoth.
19108008 Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah is my scepter.
19108009 Moab is my washbasin, on Edom I toss my sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph.”
19108010 Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
19108011 Is it not you, God, you who have rejected us and no longer go out with our armies?
19108012 Give us aid against the enemy, for human help is worthless.
19108013 With God we will gain the victory, and he will trample down our enemies.
19109000 For the director of music. Of David. A psalm.
19109001 My God, whom I praise, do not remain silent,
19109002 for people who are wicked and deceitful have opened their mouths against me; they have spoken against me with lying tongues.
19109003 With words of hatred they surround me; they attack me without cause.
19109004 In return for my friendship they accuse me, but I am a man of prayer.
19109005 They repay me evil for good, and hatred for my friendship.
19109006 Appoint someone evil to oppose my enemy; let an accuser stand at his right hand.
19109007 When he is tried, let him be found guilty, and may his prayers condemn him.
19109008 May his days be few; may another take his place of leadership.
19109009 May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow.
19109010 May his children be wandering beggars; may they be driven from their ruined homes.
19109011 May a creditor seize all he has; may strangers plunder the fruits of his labor.
19109012 May no one extend kindness to him or take pity on his fatherless children.
19109013 May his descendants be cut off, their names blotted out from the next generation.
19109014 May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord; may the sin of his mother never be blotted out.
19109015 May their sins always remain before the Lord, that he may blot out their name from the earth.
19109016 For he never thought of doing a kindness, but hounded to death the poor and the needy and the brokenhearted.
19109017 He loved to pronounce a curse— may it come back on him. He found no pleasure in blessing— may it be far from him.
19109018 He wore cursing as his garment; it entered into his body like water, into his bones like oil.
19109019 May it be like a cloak wrapped about him, like a belt tied forever around him.
19109020 May this be the Lord’s payment to my accusers, to those who speak evil of me.
19109021 But you, Sovereign Lord, help me for your name’s sake; out of the goodness of your love, deliver me.
19109022 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
19109023 I fade away like an evening shadow; I am shaken off like a locust.
19109024 My knees give way from fasting; my body is thin and gaunt.
19109025 I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they shake their heads.
19109026 Help me, Lord my God; save me according to your unfailing love.
19109027 Let them know that it is your hand, that you, Lord, have done it.
19109028 While they curse, may you bless; may those who attack me be put to shame, but may your servant rejoice.
19109029 May my accusers be clothed with disgrace and wrapped in shame as in a cloak.
19109030 With my mouth I will greatly extol the Lord; in the great throng of worshipers I will praise him.
19109031 For he stands at the right hand of the needy, to save their lives from those who would condemn them.
19110000 Of David. A psalm.
19110001 The Lord says to my lord: “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”
19110002 The Lord will extend your mighty scepter from Zion, saying, “Rule in the midst of your enemies!”
19110003 Your troops will be willing on your day of battle. Arrayed in holy splendor, your young men will come to you like dew from the morning’s womb.
19110004 The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: “You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.”
19110005 The Lord is at your right hand ; he will crush kings on the day of his wrath.
19110006 He will judge the nations, heaping up the dead and crushing the rulers of the whole earth.
19110007 He will drink from a brook along the way, and so he will lift his head high.
19111001 Praise the Lord. I will extol the Lord with all my heart in the council of the upright and in the assembly.
19111002 Great are the works of the Lord; they are pondered by all who delight in them.
19111003 Glorious and majestic are his deeds, and his righteousness endures forever.
19111004 He has caused his wonders to be remembered; the Lord is gracious and compassionate.
19111005 He provides food for those who fear him; he remembers his covenant forever.
19111006 He has shown his people the power of his works, giving them the lands of other nations.
19111007 The works of his hands are faithful and just; all his precepts are trustworthy.
19111008 They are established for ever and ever, enacted in faithfulness and uprightness.
19111009 He provided redemption for his people; he ordained his covenant forever— holy and awesome is his name.
19111010 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow his precepts have good understanding. To him belongs eternal praise.
19112001 Praise the Lord. Blessed are those who fear the Lord, who find great delight in his commands.
19112002 Their children will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed.
19112003 Wealth and riches are in their houses, and their righteousness endures forever.
19112004 Even in darkness light dawns for the upright, for those who are gracious and compassionate and righteous.
19112005 Good will come to those who are generous and lend freely, who conduct their affairs with justice.
19112006 Surely the righteous will never be shaken; they will be remembered forever.
19112007 They will have no fear of bad news; their hearts are steadfast, trusting in the Lord.
19112008 Their hearts are secure, they will have no fear; in the end they will look in triumph on their foes.
19112009 They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor, their righteousness endures forever; their horn will be lifted high in honor.
19112010 The wicked will see and be vexed, they will gnash their teeth and waste away; the longings of the wicked will come to nothing.
19113001 Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord, you his servants; praise the name of the Lord.
19113002 Let the name of the Lord be praised, both now and forevermore.
19113003 From the rising of the sun to the place where it sets, the name of the Lord is to be praised.
19113004 The Lord is exalted over all the nations, his glory above the heavens.
19113005 Who is like the Lord our God, the One who sits enthroned on high,
19113006 who stoops down to look on the heavens and the earth?
19113007 He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap;
19113008 he seats them with princes, with the princes of his people.
19113009 He settles the childless woman in her home as a happy mother of children. Praise the Lord.
19114001 When Israel came out of Egypt, Jacob from a people of foreign tongue,
19114002 Judah became God’s sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
19114003 The sea looked and fled, the Jordan turned back;
19114004 the mountains leaped like rams, the hills like lambs.
19114005 Why was it, sea, that you fled? Why, Jordan, did you turn back?
19114006 Why, mountains, did you leap like rams, you hills, like lambs?
19114007 Tremble, earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
19114008 who turned the rock into a pool, the hard rock into springs of water.
19115001 Not to us, Lord, not to us but to your name be the glory, because of your love and faithfulness.
19115002 Why do the nations say, “Where is their God?”
19115003 Our God is in heaven; he does whatever pleases him.
19115004 But their idols are silver and gold, made by human hands.
19115005 They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but cannot see.
19115006 They have ears, but cannot hear, noses, but cannot smell.
19115007 They have hands, but cannot feel, feet, but cannot walk, nor can they utter a sound with their throats.
19115008 Those who make them will be like them, and so will all who trust in them.
19115009 All you Israelites, trust in the Lord— he is their help and shield.
19115010 House of Aaron, trust in the Lord— he is their help and shield.
19115011 You who fear him, trust in the Lord— he is their help and shield.
19115012 The Lord remembers us and will bless us: He will bless his people Israel, he will bless the house of Aaron,
19115013 he will bless those who fear the Lord— small and great alike.
19115014 May the Lord cause you to flourish, both you and your children.
19115015 May you be blessed by the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.
19115016 The highest heavens belong to the Lord, but the earth he has given to mankind.
19115017 It is not the dead who praise the Lord, those who go down to the place of silence;
19115018 it is we who extol the Lord, both now and forevermore. Praise the Lord.
19116001 I love the Lord, for he heard my voice; he heard my cry for mercy.
19116002 Because he turned his ear to me, I will call on him as long as I live.
19116003 The cords of death entangled me, the anguish of the grave came over me; I was overcome by distress and sorrow.
19116004 Then I called on the name of the Lord: “Lord, save me!”
19116005 The Lord is gracious and righteous; our God is full of compassion.
19116006 The Lord protects the unwary; when I was brought low, he saved me.
19116007 Return to your rest, my soul, for the Lord has been good to you.
19116008 For you, Lord, have delivered me from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling,
19116009 that I may walk before the Lord in the land of the living.
19116010 I trusted in the Lord when I said, “I am greatly afflicted”;
19116011 in my alarm I said, “Everyone is a liar.”
19116012 What shall I return to the Lord for all his goodness to me?
19116013 I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the Lord.
19116014 I will fulfill my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people.
19116015 Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his faithful servants.
19116016 Truly I am your servant, Lord; I serve you just as my mother did; you have freed me from my chains.
19116017 I will sacrifice a thank offering to you and call on the name of the Lord.
19116018 I will fulfill my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people,
19116019 in the courts of the house of the Lord— in your midst, Jerusalem. Praise the Lord.
19117001 Praise the Lord, all you nations; extol him, all you peoples.
19117002 For great is his love toward us, and the faithfulness of the Lord endures forever. Praise the Lord.
19118001 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever.
19118002 Let Israel say: “His love endures forever.”
19118003 Let the house of Aaron say: “His love endures forever.”
19118004 Let those who fear the Lord say: “His love endures forever.”
19118005 When hard pressed, I cried to the Lord; he brought me into a spacious place.
19118006 The Lord is with me; I will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?
19118007 The Lord is with me; he is my helper. I look in triumph on my enemies.
19118008 It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in humans.
19118009 It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in princes.
19118010 All the nations surrounded me, but in the name of the Lord I cut them down.
19118011 They surrounded me on every side, but in the name of the Lord I cut them down.
19118012 They swarmed around me like bees, but they were consumed as quickly as burning thorns; in the name of the Lord I cut them down.
19118013 I was pushed back and about to fall, but the Lord helped me.
19118014 The Lord is my strength and my defense ; he has become my salvation.
19118015 Shouts of joy and victory resound in the tents of the righteous: “The Lord’s right hand has done mighty things!
19118016 The Lord’s right hand is lifted high; the Lord’s right hand has done mighty things!”
19118017 I will not die but live, and will proclaim what the Lord has done.
19118018 The Lord has chastened me severely, but he has not given me over to death.
19118019 Open for me the gates of the righteous; I will enter and give thanks to the Lord.
19118020 This is the gate of the Lord through which the righteous may enter.
19118021 I will give you thanks, for you answered me; you have become my salvation.
19118022 The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;
19118023 the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes.
19118024 The Lord has done it this very day; let us rejoice today and be glad.
19118025 Lord, save us! Lord, grant us success!
19118026 Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. From the house of the Lord we bless you.
19118027 The Lord is God, and he has made his light shine on us. With boughs in hand, join in the festal procession up to the horns of the altar.
19118028 You are my God, and I will praise you; you are my God, and I will exalt you.
19118029 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever.
19119001 Blessed are those whose ways are blameless, who walk according to the law of the Lord.
19119002 Blessed are those who keep his statutes and seek him with all their heart—
19119003 they do no wrong but follow his ways.
19119004 You have laid down precepts that are to be fully obeyed.
19119005 Oh, that my ways were steadfast in obeying your decrees!
19119006 Then I would not be put to shame when I consider all your commands.
19119007 I will praise you with an upright heart as I learn your righteous laws.
19119008 I will obey your decrees; do not utterly forsake me.
19119009 How can a young person stay on the path of purity? By living according to your word.
19119010 I seek you with all my heart; do not let me stray from your commands.
19119011 I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you.
19119012 Praise be to you, Lord; teach me your decrees.
19119013 With my lips I recount all the laws that come from your mouth.
19119014 I rejoice in following your statutes as one rejoices in great riches.
19119015 I meditate on your precepts and consider your ways.
19119016 I delight in your decrees; I will not neglect your word.
19119017 Be good to your servant while I live, that I may obey your word.
19119018 Open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in your law.
19119019 I am a stranger on earth; do not hide your commands from me.
19119020 My soul is consumed with longing for your laws at all times.
19119021 You rebuke the arrogant, who are accursed, those who stray from your commands.
19119022 Remove from me their scorn and contempt, for I keep your statutes.
19119023 Though rulers sit together and slander me, your servant will meditate on your decrees.
19119024 Your statutes are my delight; they are my counselors.
19119025 I am laid low in the dust; preserve my life according to your word.
19119026 I gave an account of my ways and you answered me; teach me your decrees.
19119027 Cause me to understand the way of your precepts, that I may meditate on your wonderful deeds.
19119028 My soul is weary with sorrow; strengthen me according to your word.
19119029 Keep me from deceitful ways; be gracious to me and teach me your law.
19119030 I have chosen the way of faithfulness; I have set my heart on your laws.
19119031 I hold fast to your statutes, Lord; do not let me be put to shame.
19119032 I run in the path of your commands, for you have broadened my understanding.
19119033 Teach me, Lord, the way of your decrees, that I may follow it to the end.
19119034 Give me understanding, so that I may keep your law and obey it with all my heart.
19119035 Direct me in the path of your commands, for there I find delight.
19119036 Turn my heart toward your statutes and not toward selfish gain.
19119037 Turn my eyes away from worthless things; preserve my life according to your word.
19119038 Fulfill your promise to your servant, so that you may be feared.
19119039 Take away the disgrace I dread, for your laws are good.
19119040 How I long for your precepts! In your righteousness preserve my life.
19119041 May your unfailing love come to me, Lord, your salvation, according to your promise;
19119042 then I can answer anyone who taunts me, for I trust in your word.
19119043 Never take your word of truth from my mouth, for I have put my hope in your laws.
19119044 I will always obey your law, for ever and ever.
19119045 I will walk about in freedom, for I have sought out your precepts.
19119046 I will speak of your statutes before kings and will not be put to shame,
19119047 for I delight in your commands because I love them.
19119048 I reach out for your commands, which I love, that I may meditate on your decrees.
19119049 Remember your word to your servant, for you have given me hope.
19119050 My comfort in my suffering is this: Your promise preserves my life.
19119051 The arrogant mock me unmercifully, but I do not turn from your law.
19119052 I remember, Lord, your ancient laws, and I find comfort in them.
19119053 Indignation grips me because of the wicked, who have forsaken your law.
19119054 Your decrees are the theme of my song wherever I lodge.
19119055 In the night, Lord, I remember your name, that I may keep your law.
19119056 This has been my practice: I obey your precepts.
19119057 You are my portion, Lord; I have promised to obey your words.
19119058 I have sought your face with all my heart; be gracious to me according to your promise.
19119059 I have considered my ways and have turned my steps to your statutes.
19119060 I will hasten and not delay to obey your commands.
19119061 Though the wicked bind me with ropes, I will not forget your law.
19119062 At midnight I rise to give you thanks for your righteous laws.
19119063 I am a friend to all who fear you, to all who follow your precepts.
19119064 The earth is filled with your love, Lord; teach me your decrees.
19119065 Do good to your servant according to your word, Lord.
19119066 Teach me knowledge and good judgment, for I trust your commands.
19119067 Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I obey your word.
19119068 You are good, and what you do is good; teach me your decrees.
19119069 Though the arrogant have smeared me with lies, I keep your precepts with all my heart.
19119070 Their hearts are callous and unfeeling, but I delight in your law.
19119071 It was good for me to be afflicted so that I might learn your decrees.
19119072 The law from your mouth is more precious to me than thousands of pieces of silver and gold.
19119073 Your hands made me and formed me; give me understanding to learn your commands.
19119074 May those who fear you rejoice when they see me, for I have put my hope in your word.
19119075 I know, Lord, that your laws are righteous, and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me.
19119076 May your unfailing love be my comfort, according to your promise to your servant.
19119077 Let your compassion come to me that I may live, for your law is my delight.
19119078 May the arrogant be put to shame for wronging me without cause; but I will meditate on your precepts.
19119079 May those who fear you turn to me, those who understand your statutes.
19119080 May I wholeheartedly follow your decrees, that I may not be put to shame.
19119081 My soul faints with longing for your salvation, but I have put my hope in your word.
19119082 My eyes fail, looking for your promise; I say, “When will you comfort me?”
19119083 Though I am like a wineskin in the smoke, I do not forget your decrees.
19119084 How long must your servant wait? When will you punish my persecutors?
19119085 The arrogant dig pits to trap me, contrary to your law.
19119086 All your commands are trustworthy; help me, for I am being persecuted without cause.
19119087 They almost wiped me from the earth, but I have not forsaken your precepts.
19119088 In your unfailing love preserve my life, that I may obey the statutes of your mouth.
19119089 Your word, Lord, is eternal; it stands firm in the heavens.
19119090 Your faithfulness continues through all generations; you established the earth, and it endures.
19119091 Your laws endure to this day, for all things serve you.
19119092 If your law had not been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction.
19119093 I will never forget your precepts, for by them you have preserved my life.
19119094 Save me, for I am yours; I have sought out your precepts.
19119095 The wicked are waiting to destroy me, but I will ponder your statutes.
19119096 To all perfection I see a limit, but your commands are boundless.
19119097 Oh, how I love your law! I meditate on it all day long.
19119098 Your commands are always with me and make me wiser than my enemies.
19119099 I have more insight than all my teachers, for I meditate on your statutes.
19119100 I have more understanding than the elders, for I obey your precepts.
19119101 I have kept my feet from every evil path so that I might obey your word.
19119102 I have not departed from your laws, for you yourself have taught me.
19119103 How sweet are your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
19119104 I gain understanding from your precepts; therefore I hate every wrong path.
19119105 Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.
19119106 I have taken an oath and confirmed it, that I will follow your righteous laws.
19119107 I have suffered much; preserve my life, Lord, according to your word.
19119108 Accept, Lord, the willing praise of my mouth, and teach me your laws.
19119109 Though I constantly take my life in my hands, I will not forget your law.
19119110 The wicked have set a snare for me, but I have not strayed from your precepts.
19119111 Your statutes are my heritage forever; they are the joy of my heart.
19119112 My heart is set on keeping your decrees to the very end.
19119113 I hate double-minded people, but I love your law.
19119114 You are my refuge and my shield; I have put my hope in your word.
19119115 Away from me, you evildoers, that I may keep the commands of my God!
19119116 Sustain me, my God, according to your promise, and I will live; do not let my hopes be dashed.
19119117 Uphold me, and I will be delivered; I will always have regard for your decrees.
19119118 You reject all who stray from your decrees, for their delusions come to nothing.
19119119 All the wicked of the earth you discard like dross; therefore I love your statutes.
19119120 My flesh trembles in fear of you; I stand in awe of your laws.
19119121 I have done what is righteous and just; do not leave me to my oppressors.
19119122 Ensure your servant’s well-being; do not let the arrogant oppress me.
19119123 My eyes fail, looking for your salvation, looking for your righteous promise.
19119124 Deal with your servant according to your love and teach me your decrees.
19119125 I am your servant; give me discernment that I may understand your statutes.
19119126 It is time for you to act, Lord; your law is being broken.
19119127 Because I love your commands more than gold, more than pure gold,
19119128 and because I consider all your precepts right, I hate every wrong path.
19119129 Your statutes are wonderful; therefore I obey them.
19119130 The unfolding of your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple.
19119131 I open my mouth and pant, longing for your commands.
19119132 Turn to me and have mercy on me, as you always do to those who love your name.
19119133 Direct my footsteps according to your word; let no sin rule over me.
19119134 Redeem me from human oppression, that I may obey your precepts.
19119135 Make your face shine on your servant and teach me your decrees.
19119136 Streams of tears flow from my eyes, for your law is not obeyed.
19119137 You are righteous, Lord, and your laws are right.
19119138 The statutes you have laid down are righteous; they are fully trustworthy.
19119139 My zeal wears me out, for my enemies ignore your words.
19119140 Your promises have been thoroughly tested, and your servant loves them.
19119141 Though I am lowly and despised, I do not forget your precepts.
19119142 Your righteousness is everlasting and your law is true.
19119143 Trouble and distress have come upon me, but your commands give me delight.
19119144 Your statutes are always righteous; give me understanding that I may live.
19119145 I call with all my heart; answer me, Lord, and I will obey your decrees.
19119146 I call out to you; save me and I will keep your statutes.
19119147 I rise before dawn and cry for help; I have put my hope in your word.
19119148 My eyes stay open through the watches of the night, that I may meditate on your promises.
19119149 Hear my voice in accordance with your love; preserve my life, Lord, according to your laws.
19119150 Those who devise wicked schemes are near, but they are far from your law.
19119151 Yet you are near, Lord, and all your commands are true.
19119152 Long ago I learned from your statutes that you established them to last forever.
19119153 Look on my suffering and deliver me, for I have not forgotten your law.
19119154 Defend my cause and redeem me; preserve my life according to your promise.
19119155 Salvation is far from the wicked, for they do not seek out your decrees.
19119156 Your compassion, Lord, is great; preserve my life according to your laws.
19119157 Many are the foes who persecute me, but I have not turned from your statutes.
19119158 I look on the faithless with loathing, for they do not obey your word.
19119159 See how I love your precepts; preserve my life, Lord, in accordance with your love.
19119160 All your words are true; all your righteous laws are eternal.
19119161 Rulers persecute me without cause, but my heart trembles at your word.
19119162 I rejoice in your promise like one who finds great spoil.
19119163 I hate and detest falsehood but I love your law.
19119164 Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous laws.
19119165 Great peace have those who love your law, and nothing can make them stumble.
19119166 I wait for your salvation, Lord, and I follow your commands.
19119167 I obey your statutes, for I love them greatly.
19119168 I obey your precepts and your statutes, for all my ways are known to you.
19119169 May my cry come before you, Lord; give me understanding according to your word.
19119170 May my supplication come before you; deliver me according to your promise.
19119171 May my lips overflow with praise, for you teach me your decrees.
19119172 May my tongue sing of your word, for all your commands are righteous.
19119173 May your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen your precepts.
19119174 I long for your salvation, Lord, and your law gives me delight.
19119175 Let me live that I may praise you, and may your laws sustain me.
19119176 I have strayed like a lost sheep. Seek your servant, for I have not forgotten your commands.
19120000 A song of ascents.
19120001 I call on the Lord in my distress, and he answers me.
19120002 Save me, Lord, from lying lips and from deceitful tongues.
19120003 What will he do to you, and what more besides, you deceitful tongue?
19120004 He will punish you with a warrior’s sharp arrows, with burning coals of the broom bush.
19120005 Woe to me that I dwell in Meshek, that I live among the tents of Kedar!
19120006 Too long have I lived among those who hate peace.
19120007 I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.
19121000 A song of ascents.
19121001 I lift up my eyes to the mountains— where does my help come from?
19121002 My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.
19121003 He will not let your foot slip— he who watches over you will not slumber;
19121004 indeed, he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
19121005 The Lord watches over you— the Lord is your shade at your right hand;
19121006 the sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night.
19121007 The Lord will keep you from all harm— he will watch over your life;
19121008 the Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore.
19122000 A song of ascents. Of David.
19122001 I rejoiced with those who said to me, “Let us go to the house of the Lord.”
19122002 Our feet are standing in your gates, Jerusalem.
19122003 Jerusalem is built like a city that is closely compacted together.
19122004 That is where the tribes go up— the tribes of the Lord— to praise the name of the Lord according to the statute given to Israel.
19122005 There stand the thrones for judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
19122006 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: “May those who love you be secure.
19122007 May there be peace within your walls and security within your citadels.”
19122008 For the sake of my family and friends, I will say, “Peace be within you.”
19122009 For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek your prosperity.
19123000 A song of ascents.
19123001 I lift up my eyes to you, to you who sit enthroned in heaven.
19123002 As the eyes of slaves look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a female slave look to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the Lord our God, till he shows us his mercy.
19123003 Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy on us, for we have endured no end of contempt.
19123004 We have endured no end of ridicule from the arrogant, of contempt from the proud.
19124000 A song of ascents. Of David.
19124001 If the Lord had not been on our side— let Israel say—
19124002 if the Lord had not been on our side when people attacked us,
19124003 they would have swallowed us alive when their anger flared against us;
19124004 the flood would have engulfed us, the torrent would have swept over us,
19124005 the raging waters would have swept us away.
19124006 Praise be to the Lord, who has not let us be torn by their teeth.
19124007 We have escaped like a bird from the fowler’s snare; the snare has been broken, and we have escaped.
19124008 Our help is in the name of the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.
19125000 A song of ascents.
19125001 Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, which cannot be shaken but endures forever.
19125002 As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the Lord surrounds his people both now and forevermore.
19125003 The scepter of the wicked will not remain over the land allotted to the righteous, for then the righteous might use their hands to do evil.
19125004 Lord, do good to those who are good, to those who are upright in heart.
19125005 But those who turn to crooked ways the Lord will banish with the evildoers. Peace be on Israel.
19126000 A song of ascents.
19126001 When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dreamed.
19126002 Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with songs of joy. Then it was said among the nations, “The Lord has done great things for them.”
19126003 The Lord has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy.
19126004 Restore our fortunes, Lord, like streams in the Negev.
19126005 Those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy.
19126006 Those who go out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with them.
19127000 A song of ascents. Of Solomon.
19127001 Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain. Unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain.
19127002 In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat— for he grants sleep to those he loves.
19127003 Children are a heritage from the Lord, offspring a reward from him.
19127004 Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are children born in one’s youth.
19127005 Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they contend with their opponents in court.
19128000 A song of ascents.
19128001 Blessed are all who fear the Lord, who walk in obedience to him.
19128002 You will eat the fruit of your labor; blessings and prosperity will be yours.
19128003 Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house; your children will be like olive shoots around your table.
19128004 Yes, this will be the blessing for the man who fears the Lord.
19128005 May the Lord bless you from Zion; may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
19128006 May you live to see your children’s children— peace be on Israel.
19129000 A song of ascents.
19129001 “They have greatly oppressed me from my youth,” let Israel say;
19129002 “they have greatly oppressed me from my youth, but they have not gained the victory over me.
19129003 Plowmen have plowed my back and made their furrows long.
19129004 But the Lord is righteous; he has cut me free from the cords of the wicked.”
19129005 May all who hate Zion be turned back in shame.
19129006 May they be like grass on the roof, which withers before it can grow;
19129007 a reaper cannot fill his hands with it, nor one who gathers fill his arms.
19129008 May those who pass by not say to them, “The blessing of the Lord be on you; we bless you in the name of the Lord.”
19130000 A song of ascents.
19130001 Out of the depths I cry to you, Lord;
19130002 Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy.
19130003 If you, Lord, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand?
19130004 But with you there is forgiveness, so that we can, with reverence, serve you.
19130005 I wait for the Lord, my whole being waits, and in his word I put my hope.
19130006 I wait for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning, more than watchmen wait for the morning.
19130007 Israel, put your hope in the Lord, for with the Lord is unfailing love and with him is full redemption.
19130008 He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins.
19131000 A song of ascents. Of David.
19131001 My heart is not proud, Lord, my eyes are not haughty; I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me.
19131002 But I have calmed and quieted myself, I am like a weaned child with its mother; like a weaned child I am content.
19131003 Israel, put your hope in the Lord both now and forevermore.
19132000 A song of ascents.
19132001 Lord, remember David and all his self-denial.
19132002 He swore an oath to the Lord, he made a vow to the Mighty One of Jacob:
19132003 “I will not enter my house or go to my bed,
19132004 I will allow no sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids,
19132005 till I find a place for the Lord, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”
19132006 We heard it in Ephrathah, we came upon it in the fields of Jaar:
19132007 “Let us go to his dwelling place, let us worship at his footstool, saying,
19132008 ‘Arise, Lord, and come to your resting place, you and the ark of your might.
19132009 May your priests be clothed with your righteousness; may your faithful people sing for joy.’ ”
19132010 For the sake of your servant David, do not reject your anointed one.
19132011 The Lord swore an oath to David, a sure oath he will not revoke: “One of your own descendants I will place on your throne.
19132012 If your sons keep my covenant and the statutes I teach them, then their sons will sit on your throne for ever and ever.”
19132013 For the Lord has chosen Zion, he has desired it for his dwelling, saying,
19132014 “This is my resting place for ever and ever; here I will sit enthroned, for I have desired it.
19132015 I will bless her with abundant provisions; her poor I will satisfy with food.
19132016 I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her faithful people will ever sing for joy.
19132017 “Here I will make a horn grow for David and set up a lamp for my anointed one.
19132018 I will clothe his enemies with shame, but his head will be adorned with a radiant crown.”
19133000 A song of ascents. Of David.
19133001 How good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity!
19133002 It is like precious oil poured on the head, running down on the beard, running down on Aaron’s beard, down on the collar of his robe.
19133003 It is as if the dew of Hermon were falling on Mount Zion. For there the Lord bestows his blessing, even life forevermore.
19134000 A song of ascents.
19134001 Praise the Lord, all you servants of the Lord who minister by night in the house of the Lord.
19134002 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary and praise the Lord.
19134003 May the Lord bless you from Zion, he who is the Maker of heaven and earth.
19135001 Praise the Lord. Praise the name of the Lord; praise him, you servants of the Lord,
19135002 you who minister in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.
19135003 Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good; sing praise to his name, for that is pleasant.
19135004 For the Lord has chosen Jacob to be his own, Israel to be his treasured possession.
19135005 I know that the Lord is great, that our Lord is greater than all gods.
19135006 The Lord does whatever pleases him, in the heavens and on the earth, in the seas and all their depths.
19135007 He makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth; he sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses.
19135008 He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, the firstborn of people and animals.
19135009 He sent his signs and wonders into your midst, Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants.
19135010 He struck down many nations and killed mighty kings—
19135011 Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kings of Canaan—
19135012 and he gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance to his people Israel.
19135013 Your name, Lord, endures forever, your renown, Lord, through all generations.
19135014 For the Lord will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants.
19135015 The idols of the nations are silver and gold, made by human hands.
19135016 They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but cannot see.
19135017 They have ears, but cannot hear, nor is there breath in their mouths.
19135018 Those who make them will be like them, and so will all who trust in them.
19135019 All you Israelites, praise the Lord; house of Aaron, praise the Lord;
19135020 house of Levi, praise the Lord; you who fear him, praise the Lord.
19135021 Praise be to the Lord from Zion, to him who dwells in Jerusalem. Praise the Lord.
19136001 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good. His love endures forever.
19136002 Give thanks to the God of gods. His love endures forever.
19136003 Give thanks to the Lord of lords: His love endures forever.
19136004 to him who alone does great wonders, His love endures forever.
19136005 who by his understanding made the heavens, His love endures forever.
19136006 who spread out the earth upon the waters, His love endures forever.
19136007 who made the great lights— His love endures forever.
19136008 the sun to govern the day, His love endures forever.
19136009 the moon and stars to govern the night; His love endures forever.
19136010 to him who struck down the firstborn of Egypt His love endures forever.
19136011 and brought Israel out from among them His love endures forever.
19136012 with a mighty hand and outstretched arm; His love endures forever.
19136013 to him who divided the Red Sea asunder His love endures forever.
19136014 and brought Israel through the midst of it, His love endures forever.
19136015 but swept Pharaoh and his army into the Red Sea; His love endures forever.
19136016 to him who led his people through the wilderness; His love endures forever.
19136017 to him who struck down great kings, His love endures forever.
19136018 and killed mighty kings— His love endures forever.
19136019 Sihon king of the Amorites His love endures forever.
19136020 and Og king of Bashan— His love endures forever.
19136021 and gave their land as an inheritance, His love endures forever.
19136022 an inheritance to his servant Israel. His love endures forever.
19136023 He remembered us in our low estate His love endures forever.
19136024 and freed us from our enemies. His love endures forever.
19136025 He gives food to every creature. His love endures forever.
19136026 Give thanks to the God of heaven. His love endures forever.
19137001 By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept when we remembered Zion.
19137002 There on the poplars we hung our harps,
19137003 for there our captors asked us for songs, our tormentors demanded songs of joy; they said, “Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”
19137004 How can we sing the songs of the Lord while in a foreign land?
19137005 If I forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill.
19137006 May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you, if I do not consider Jerusalem my highest joy.
19137007 Remember, Lord, what the Edomites did on the day Jerusalem fell. “Tear it down,” they cried, “tear it down to its foundations!”
19137008 Daughter Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is the one who repays you according to what you have done to us.
19137009 Happy is the one who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.
19138000 Of David.
19138001 I will praise you, Lord, with all my heart; before the “gods” I will sing your praise.
19138002 I will bow down toward your holy temple and will praise your name for your unfailing love and your faithfulness, for you have so exalted your solemn decree that it surpasses your fame.
19138003 When I called, you answered me; you greatly emboldened me.
19138004 May all the kings of the earth praise you, Lord, when they hear what you have decreed.
19138005 May they sing of the ways of the Lord, for the glory of the Lord is great.
19138006 Though the Lord is exalted, he looks kindly on the lowly; though lofty, he sees them from afar.
19138007 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you preserve my life. You stretch out your hand against the anger of my foes; with your right hand you save me.
19138008 The Lord will vindicate me; your love, Lord, endures forever— do not abandon the works of your hands.
19139000 For the director of music. Of David. A psalm.
19139001 You have searched me, Lord, and you know me.
19139002 You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar.
19139003 You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all my ways.
19139004 Before a word is on my tongue you, Lord, know it completely.
19139005 You hem me in behind and before, and you lay your hand upon me.
19139006 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain.
19139007 Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?
19139008 If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.
19139009 If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea,
19139010 even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast.
19139011 If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me,”
19139012 even the darkness will not be dark to you; the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you.
19139013 For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb.
19139014 I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.
19139015 My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place, when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.
19139016 Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.
19139017 How precious to me are your thoughts, God! How vast is the sum of them!
19139018 Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand— when I awake, I am still with you.
19139019 If only you, God, would slay the wicked! Away from me, you who are bloodthirsty!
19139020 They speak of you with evil intent; your adversaries misuse your name.
19139021 Do I not hate those who hate you, Lord, and abhor those who are in rebellion against you?
19139022 I have nothing but hatred for them; I count them my enemies.
19139023 Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts.
19139024 See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
19140000 For the director of music. A psalm of David.
19140001 Rescue me, Lord, from evildoers; protect me from the violent,
19140002 who devise evil plans in their hearts and stir up war every day.
19140003 They make their tongues as sharp as a serpent’s; the poison of vipers is on their lips.
19140004 Keep me safe, Lord, from the hands of the wicked; protect me from the violent, who devise ways to trip my feet.
19140005 The arrogant have hidden a snare for me; they have spread out the cords of their net and have set traps for me along my path.
19140006 I say to the Lord, “You are my God.” Hear, Lord, my cry for mercy.
19140007 Sovereign Lord, my strong deliverer, you shield my head in the day of battle.
19140008 Do not grant the wicked their desires, Lord; do not let their plans succeed.
19140009 Those who surround me proudly rear their heads; may the mischief of their lips engulf them.
19140010 May burning coals fall on them; may they be thrown into the fire, into miry pits, never to rise.
19140011 May slanderers not be established in the land; may disaster hunt down the violent.
19140012 I know that the Lord secures justice for the poor and upholds the cause of the needy.
19140013 Surely the righteous will praise your name, and the upright will live in your presence.
19141000 A psalm of David.
19141001 I call to you, Lord, come quickly to me; hear me when I call to you.
19141002 May my prayer be set before you like incense; may the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice.
19141003 Set a guard over my mouth, Lord; keep watch over the door of my lips.
19141004 Do not let my heart be drawn to what is evil so that I take part in wicked deeds along with those who are evildoers; do not let me eat their delicacies.
19141005 Let a righteous man strike me—that is a kindness; let him rebuke me—that is oil on my head. My head will not refuse it, for my prayer will still be against the deeds of evildoers.
19141006 Their rulers will be thrown down from the cliffs, and the wicked will learn that my words were well spoken.
19141007 They will say, “As one plows and breaks up the earth, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of the grave.”
19141008 But my eyes are fixed on you, Sovereign Lord; in you I take refuge—do not give me over to death.
19141009 Keep me safe from the traps set by evildoers, from the snares they have laid for me.
19141010 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by in safety.
19142000 A maskil of David. When he was in the cave. A prayer.
19142001 I cry aloud to the Lord; I lift up my voice to the Lord for mercy.
19142002 I pour out before him my complaint; before him I tell my trouble.
19142003 When my spirit grows faint within me, it is you who watch over my way. In the path where I walk people have hidden a snare for me.
19142004 Look and see, there is no one at my right hand; no one is concerned for me. I have no refuge; no one cares for my life.
19142005 I cry to you, Lord; I say, “You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.”
19142006 Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need; rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me.
19142007 Set me free from my prison, that I may praise your name. Then the righteous will gather about me because of your goodness to me.
19143000 A psalm of David.
19143001 Lord, hear my prayer, listen to my cry for mercy; in your faithfulness and righteousness come to my relief.
19143002 Do not bring your servant into judgment, for no one living is righteous before you.
19143003 The enemy pursues me, he crushes me to the ground; he makes me dwell in the darkness like those long dead.
19143004 So my spirit grows faint within me; my heart within me is dismayed.
19143005 I remember the days of long ago; I meditate on all your works and consider what your hands have done.
19143006 I spread out my hands to you; I thirst for you like a parched land.
19143007 Answer me quickly, Lord; my spirit fails. Do not hide your face from me or I will be like those who go down to the pit.
19143008 Let the morning bring me word of your unfailing love, for I have put my trust in you. Show me the way I should go, for to you I entrust my life.
19143009 Rescue me from my enemies, Lord, for I hide myself in you.
19143010 Teach me to do your will, for you are my God; may your good Spirit lead me on level ground.
19143011 For your name’s sake, Lord, preserve my life; in your righteousness, bring me out of trouble.
19143012 In your unfailing love, silence my enemies; destroy all my foes, for I am your servant.
19144000 Of David.
19144001 Praise be to the Lord my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.
19144002 He is my loving God and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer, my shield, in whom I take refuge, who subdues peoples under me.
19144003 Lord, what are human beings that you care for them, mere mortals that you think of them?
19144004 They are like a breath; their days are like a fleeting shadow.
19144005 Part your heavens, Lord, and come down; touch the mountains, so that they smoke.
19144006 Send forth lightning and scatter the enemy; shoot your arrows and rout them.
19144007 Reach down your hand from on high; deliver me and rescue me from the mighty waters, from the hands of foreigners
19144008 whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful.
19144009 I will sing a new song to you, my God; on the ten-stringed lyre I will make music to you,
19144010 to the One who gives victory to kings, who delivers his servant David. From the deadly sword
19144011 deliver me; rescue me from the hands of foreigners whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful.
19144012 Then our sons in their youth will be like well-nurtured plants, and our daughters will be like pillars carved to adorn a palace.
19144013 Our barns will be filled with every kind of provision. Our sheep will increase by thousands, by tens of thousands in our fields;
19144014 our oxen will draw heavy loads. There will be no breaching of walls, no going into captivity, no cry of distress in our streets.
19144015 Blessed is the people of whom this is true; blessed is the people whose God is the Lord.
19145000 A psalm of praise. Of David.
19145001 I will exalt you, my God the King; I will praise your name for ever and ever.
19145002 Every day I will praise you and extol your name for ever and ever.
19145003 Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise; his greatness no one can fathom.
19145004 One generation commends your works to another; they tell of your mighty acts.
19145005 They speak of the glorious splendor of your majesty— and I will meditate on your wonderful works.
19145006 They tell of the power of your awesome works— and I will proclaim your great deeds.
19145007 They celebrate your abundant goodness and joyfully sing of your righteousness.
19145008 The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in love.
19145009 The Lord is good to all; he has compassion on all he has made.
19145010 All your works praise you, Lord; your faithful people extol you.
19145011 They tell of the glory of your kingdom and speak of your might,
19145012 so that all people may know of your mighty acts and the glorious splendor of your kingdom.
19145013 Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures through all generations. The Lord is trustworthy in all he promises and faithful in all he does.
19145014 The Lord upholds all who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down.
19145015 The eyes of all look to you, and you give them their food at the proper time.
19145016 You open your hand and satisfy the desires of every living thing.
19145017 The Lord is righteous in all his ways and faithful in all he does.
19145018 The Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.
19145019 He fulfills the desires of those who fear him; he hears their cry and saves them.
19145020 The Lord watches over all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy.
19145021 My mouth will speak in praise of the Lord. Let every creature praise his holy name for ever and ever.
19146001 Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord, my soul.
19146002 I will praise the Lord all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.
19146003 Do not put your trust in princes, in human beings, who cannot save.
19146004 When their spirit departs, they return to the ground; on that very day their plans come to nothing.
19146005 Blessed are those whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord their God.
19146006 He is the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them— he remains faithful forever.
19146007 He upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. The Lord sets prisoners free,
19146008 the Lord gives sight to the blind, the Lord lifts up those who are bowed down, the Lord loves the righteous.
19146009 The Lord watches over the foreigner and sustains the fatherless and the widow, but he frustrates the ways of the wicked.
19146010 The Lord reigns forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations. Praise the Lord.
19147001 Praise the Lord. How good it is to sing praises to our God, how pleasant and fitting to praise him!
19147002 The Lord builds up Jerusalem; he gathers the exiles of Israel.
19147003 He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.
19147004 He determines the number of the stars and calls them each by name.
19147005 Great is our Lord and mighty in power; his understanding has no limit.
19147006 The Lord sustains the humble but casts the wicked to the ground.
19147007 Sing to the Lord with grateful praise; make music to our God on the harp.
19147008 He covers the sky with clouds; he supplies the earth with rain and makes grass grow on the hills.
19147009 He provides food for the cattle and for the young ravens when they call.
19147010 His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse, nor his delight in the legs of the warrior;
19147011 the Lord delights in those who fear him, who put their hope in his unfailing love.
19147012 Extol the Lord, Jerusalem; praise your God, Zion.
19147013 He strengthens the bars of your gates and blesses your people within you.
19147014 He grants peace to your borders and satisfies you with the finest of wheat.
19147015 He sends his command to the earth; his word runs swiftly.
19147016 He spreads the snow like wool and scatters the frost like ashes.
19147017 He hurls down his hail like pebbles. Who can withstand his icy blast?
19147018 He sends his word and melts them; he stirs up his breezes, and the waters flow.
19147019 He has revealed his word to Jacob, his laws and decrees to Israel.
19147020 He has done this for no other nation; they do not know his laws. Praise the Lord.
19148001 Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord from the heavens; praise him in the heights above.
19148002 Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his heavenly hosts.
19148003 Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all you shining stars.
19148004 Praise him, you highest heavens and you waters above the skies.
19148005 Let them praise the name of the Lord, for at his command they were created,
19148006 and he established them for ever and ever— he issued a decree that will never pass away.
19148007 Praise the Lord from the earth, you great sea creatures and all ocean depths,
19148008 lightning and hail, snow and clouds, stormy winds that do his bidding,
19148009 you mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars,
19148010 wild animals and all cattle, small creatures and flying birds,
19148011 kings of the earth and all nations, you princes and all rulers on earth,
19148012 young men and women, old men and children.
19148013 Let them praise the name of the Lord, for his name alone is exalted; his splendor is above the earth and the heavens.
19148014 And he has raised up for his people a horn, the praise of all his faithful servants, of Israel, the people close to his heart. Praise the Lord.
19149001 Praise the Lord. Sing to the Lord a new song, his praise in the assembly of his faithful people.
19149002 Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; let the people of Zion be glad in their King.
19149003 Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp.
19149004 For the Lord takes delight in his people; he crowns the humble with victory.
19149005 Let his faithful people rejoice in this honor and sing for joy on their beds.
19149006 May the praise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in their hands,
19149007 to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples,
19149008 to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles with shackles of iron,
19149009 to carry out the sentence written against them— this is the glory of all his faithful people. Praise the Lord.
19150001 Praise the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in his mighty heavens.
19150002 Praise him for his acts of power; praise him for his surpassing greatness.
19150003 Praise him with the sounding of the trumpet, praise him with the harp and lyre,
19150004 praise him with timbrel and dancing, praise him with the strings and pipe,
19150005 praise him with the clash of cymbals, praise him with resounding cymbals.
19150006 Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
20001001 The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:
20001002 for gaining wisdom and instruction; for understanding words of insight;
20001003 for receiving instruction in prudent behavior, doing what is right and just and fair;
20001004 for giving prudence to those who are simple, knowledge and discretion to the young—
20001005 let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance—
20001006 for understanding proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise.
20001007 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction.
20001008 Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.
20001009 They are a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck.
20001010 My son, if sinful men entice you, do not give in to them.
20001011 If they say, “Come along with us; let’s lie in wait for innocent blood, let’s ambush some harmless soul;
20001012 let’s swallow them alive, like the grave, and whole, like those who go down to the pit;
20001013 we will get all sorts of valuable things and fill our houses with plunder;
20001014 cast lots with us; we will all share the loot”—
20001015 my son, do not go along with them, do not set foot on their paths;
20001016 for their feet rush into evil, they are swift to shed blood.
20001017 How useless to spread a net where every bird can see it!
20001018 These men lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush only themselves!
20001019 Such are the paths of all who go after ill-gotten gain; it takes away the life of those who get it.
20001020 Out in the open wisdom calls aloud, she raises her voice in the public square;
20001021 on top of the wall she cries out, at the city gate she makes her speech:
20001022 “How long will you who are simple love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?
20001023 Repent at my rebuke! Then I will pour out my thoughts to you, I will make known to you my teachings.
20001024 But since you refuse to listen when I call and no one pays attention when I stretch out my hand,
20001025 since you disregard all my advice and do not accept my rebuke,
20001026 I in turn will laugh when disaster strikes you; I will mock when calamity overtakes you—
20001027 when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you.
20001028 “Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they will look for me but will not find me,
20001029 since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the Lord.
20001030 Since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke,
20001031 they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.
20001032 For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them;
20001033 but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm.”
20002001 My son, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you,
20002002 turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding—
20002003 indeed, if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding,
20002004 and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure,
20002005 then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God.
20002006 For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.
20002007 He holds success in store for the upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless,
20002008 for he guards the course of the just and protects the way of his faithful ones.
20002009 Then you will understand what is right and just and fair—every good path.
20002010 For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.
20002011 Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you.
20002012 Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men, from men whose words are perverse,
20002013 who have left the straight paths to walk in dark ways,
20002014 who delight in doing wrong and rejoice in the perverseness of evil,
20002015 whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways.
20002016 Wisdom will save you also from the adulterous woman, from the wayward woman with her seductive words,
20002017 who has left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God.
20002018 Surely her house leads down to death and her paths to the spirits of the dead.
20002019 None who go to her return or attain the paths of life.
20002020 Thus you will walk in the ways of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous.
20002021 For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it;
20002022 but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be torn from it.
20003001 My son, do not forget my teaching, but keep my commands in your heart,
20003002 for they will prolong your life many years and bring you peace and prosperity.
20003003 Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.
20003004 Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man.
20003005 Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding;
20003006 in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.
20003007 Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord and shun evil.
20003008 This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones.
20003009 Honor the Lord with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops;
20003010 then your barns will be filled to overflowing, and your vats will brim over with new wine.
20003011 My son, do not despise the Lord’s discipline, and do not resent his rebuke,
20003012 because the Lord disciplines those he loves, as a father the son he delights in.
20003013 Blessed are those who find wisdom, those who gain understanding,
20003014 for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold.
20003015 She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can compare with her.
20003016 Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.
20003017 Her ways are pleasant ways, and all her paths are peace.
20003018 She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her; those who hold her fast will be blessed.
20003019 By wisdom the Lord laid the earth’s foundations, by understanding he set the heavens in place;
20003020 by his knowledge the watery depths were divided, and the clouds let drop the dew.
20003021 My son, do not let wisdom and understanding out of your sight, preserve sound judgment and discretion;
20003022 they will be life for you, an ornament to grace your neck.
20003023 Then you will go on your way in safety, and your foot will not stumble.
20003024 When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
20003025 Have no fear of sudden disaster or of the ruin that overtakes the wicked,
20003026 for the Lord will be at your side and will keep your foot from being snared.
20003027 Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to act.
20003028 Do not say to your neighbor, “Come back tomorrow and I’ll give it to you”— when you already have it with you.
20003029 Do not plot harm against your neighbor, who lives trustfully near you.
20003030 Do not accuse anyone for no reason— when they have done you no harm.
20003031 Do not envy the violent or choose any of their ways.
20003032 For the Lord detests the perverse but takes the upright into his confidence.
20003033 The Lord’s curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the home of the righteous.
20003034 He mocks proud mockers but shows favor to the humble and oppressed.
20003035 The wise inherit honor, but fools get only shame.
20004001 Listen, my sons, to a father’s instruction; pay attention and gain understanding.
20004002 I give you sound learning, so do not forsake my teaching.
20004003 For I too was a son to my father, still tender, and cherished by my mother.
20004004 Then he taught me, and he said to me, “Take hold of my words with all your heart; keep my commands, and you will live.
20004005 Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget my words or turn away from them.
20004006 Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you; love her, and she will watch over you.
20004007 The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom. Though it cost all you have, get understanding.
20004008 Cherish her, and she will exalt you; embrace her, and she will honor you.
20004009 She will give you a garland to grace your head and present you with a glorious crown.”
20004010 Listen, my son, accept what I say, and the years of your life will be many.
20004011 I instruct you in the way of wisdom and lead you along straight paths.
20004012 When you walk, your steps will not be hampered; when you run, you will not stumble.
20004013 Hold on to instruction, do not let it go; guard it well, for it is your life.
20004014 Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evildoers.
20004015 Avoid it, do not travel on it; turn from it and go on your way.
20004016 For they cannot rest until they do evil; they are robbed of sleep till they make someone stumble.
20004017 They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.
20004018 The path of the righteous is like the morning sun, shining ever brighter till the full light of day.
20004019 But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what makes them stumble.
20004020 My son, pay attention to what I say; turn your ear to my words.
20004021 Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart;
20004022 for they are life to those who find them and health to one’s whole body.
20004023 Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.
20004024 Keep your mouth free of perversity; keep corrupt talk far from your lips.
20004025 Let your eyes look straight ahead; fix your gaze directly before you.
20004026 Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways.
20004027 Do not turn to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil.
20005001 My son, pay attention to my wisdom, turn your ear to my words of insight,
20005002 that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge.
20005003 For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil;
20005004 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword.
20005005 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave.
20005006 She gives no thought to the way of life; her paths wander aimlessly, but she does not know it.
20005007 Now then, my sons, listen to me; do not turn aside from what I say.
20005008 Keep to a path far from her, do not go near the door of her house,
20005009 lest you lose your honor to others and your dignity to one who is cruel,
20005010 lest strangers feast on your wealth and your toil enrich the house of another.
20005011 At the end of your life you will groan, when your flesh and body are spent.
20005012 You will say, “How I hated discipline! How my heart spurned correction!
20005013 I would not obey my teachers or turn my ear to my instructors.
20005014 And I was soon in serious trouble in the assembly of God’s people.”
20005015 Drink water from your own cistern, running water from your own well.
20005016 Should your springs overflow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares?
20005017 Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.
20005018 May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth.
20005019 A loving doe, a graceful deer— may her breasts satisfy you always, may you ever be intoxicated with her love.
20005020 Why, my son, be intoxicated with another man’s wife? Why embrace the bosom of a wayward woman?
20005021 For your ways are in full view of the Lord, and he examines all your paths.
20005022 The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare them; the cords of their sins hold them fast.
20005023 For lack of discipline they will die, led astray by their own great folly.
20006001 My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, if you have shaken hands in pledge for a stranger,
20006002 you have been trapped by what you said, ensnared by the words of your mouth.
20006003 So do this, my son, to free yourself, since you have fallen into your neighbor’s hands: Go—to the point of exhaustion— and give your neighbor no rest!
20006004 Allow no sleep to your eyes, no slumber to your eyelids.
20006005 Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler.
20006006 Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise!
20006007 It has no commander, no overseer or ruler,
20006008 yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest.
20006009 How long will you lie there, you sluggard? When will you get up from your sleep?
20006010 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest—
20006011 and poverty will come on you like a thief and scarcity like an armed man.
20006012 A troublemaker and a villain, who goes about with a corrupt mouth,
20006013 who winks maliciously with his eye, signals with his feet and motions with his fingers,
20006014 who plots evil with deceit in his heart— he always stirs up conflict.
20006015 Therefore disaster will overtake him in an instant; he will suddenly be destroyed—without remedy.
20006016 There are six things the Lord hates, seven that are detestable to him:
20006017 haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,
20006018 a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil,
20006019 a false witness who pours out lies and a person who stirs up conflict in the community.
20006020 My son, keep your father’s command and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.
20006021 Bind them always on your heart; fasten them around your neck.
20006022 When you walk, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you.
20006023 For this command is a lamp, this teaching is a light, and correction and instruction are the way to life,
20006024 keeping you from your neighbor’s wife, from the smooth talk of a wayward woman.
20006025 Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes.
20006026 For a prostitute can be had for a loaf of bread, but another man’s wife preys on your very life.
20006027 Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned?
20006028 Can a man walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched?
20006029 So is he who sleeps with another man’s wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.
20006030 People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger when he is starving.
20006031 Yet if he is caught, he must pay sevenfold, though it costs him all the wealth of his house.
20006032 But a man who commits adultery has no sense; whoever does so destroys himself.
20006033 Blows and disgrace are his lot, and his shame will never be wiped away.
20006034 For jealousy arouses a husband’s fury, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.
20006035 He will not accept any compensation; he will refuse a bribe, however great it is.
20007001 My son, keep my words and store up my commands within you.
20007002 Keep my commands and you will live; guard my teachings as the apple of your eye.
20007003 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.
20007004 Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” and to insight, “You are my relative.”
20007005 They will keep you from the adulterous woman, from the wayward woman with her seductive words.
20007006 At the window of my house I looked down through the lattice.
20007007 I saw among the simple, I noticed among the young men, a youth who had no sense.
20007008 He was going down the street near her corner, walking along in the direction of her house
20007009 at twilight, as the day was fading, as the dark of night set in.
20007010 Then out came a woman to meet him, dressed like a prostitute and with crafty intent.
20007011 (She is unruly and defiant, her feet never stay at home;
20007012 now in the street, now in the squares, at every corner she lurks.)
20007013 She took hold of him and kissed him and with a brazen face she said:
20007014 “Today I fulfilled my vows, and I have food from my fellowship offering at home.
20007015 So I came out to meet you; I looked for you and have found you!
20007016 I have covered my bed with colored linens from Egypt.
20007017 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon.
20007018 Come, let’s drink deeply of love till morning; let’s enjoy ourselves with love!
20007019 My husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey.
20007020 He took his purse filled with money and will not be home till full moon.”
20007021 With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk.
20007022 All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer stepping into a noose
20007023 till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life.
20007024 Now then, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to what I say.
20007025 Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths.
20007026 Many are the victims she has brought down; her slain are a mighty throng.
20007027 Her house is a highway to the grave, leading down to the chambers of death.
20008001 Does not wisdom call out? Does not understanding raise her voice?
20008002 At the highest point along the way, where the paths meet, she takes her stand;
20008003 beside the gate leading into the city, at the entrance, she cries aloud:
20008004 “To you, O people, I call out; I raise my voice to all mankind.
20008005 You who are simple, gain prudence; you who are foolish, set your hearts on it.
20008006 Listen, for I have trustworthy things to say; I open my lips to speak what is right.
20008007 My mouth speaks what is true, for my lips detest wickedness.
20008008 All the words of my mouth are just; none of them is crooked or perverse.
20008009 To the discerning all of them are right; they are upright to those who have found knowledge.
20008010 Choose my instruction instead of silver, knowledge rather than choice gold,
20008011 for wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire can compare with her.
20008012 “I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence; I possess knowledge and discretion.
20008013 To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech.
20008014 Counsel and sound judgment are mine; I have insight, I have power.
20008015 By me kings reign and rulers issue decrees that are just;
20008016 by me princes govern, and nobles—all who rule on earth.
20008017 I love those who love me, and those who seek me find me.
20008018 With me are riches and honor, enduring wealth and prosperity.
20008019 My fruit is better than fine gold; what I yield surpasses choice silver.
20008020 I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice,
20008021 bestowing a rich inheritance on those who love me and making their treasuries full.
20008022 “The Lord brought me forth as the first of his works, before his deeds of old;
20008023 I was formed long ages ago, at the very beginning, when the world came to be.
20008024 When there were no watery depths, I was given birth, when there were no springs overflowing with water;
20008025 before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills, I was given birth,
20008026 before he made the world or its fields or any of the dust of the earth.
20008027 I was there when he set the heavens in place, when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep,
20008028 when he established the clouds above and fixed securely the fountains of the deep,
20008029 when he gave the sea its boundary so the waters would not overstep his command, and when he marked out the foundations of the earth.
20008030 Then I was constantly at his side. I was filled with delight day after day, rejoicing always in his presence,
20008031 rejoicing in his whole world and delighting in mankind.
20008032 “Now then, my children, listen to me; blessed are those who keep my ways.
20008033 Listen to my instruction and be wise; do not disregard it.
20008034 Blessed are those who listen to me, watching daily at my doors, waiting at my doorway.
20008035 For those who find me find life and receive favor from the Lord.
20008036 But those who fail to find me harm themselves; all who hate me love death.”
20009001 Wisdom has built her house; she has set up its seven pillars.
20009002 She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine; she has also set her table.
20009003 She has sent out her servants, and she calls from the highest point of the city,
20009004 “Let all who are simple come to my house!” To those who have no sense she says,
20009005 “Come, eat my food and drink the wine I have mixed.
20009006 Leave your simple ways and you will live; walk in the way of insight.”
20009007 Whoever corrects a mocker invites insults; whoever rebukes the wicked incurs abuse.
20009008 Do not rebuke mockers or they will hate you; rebuke the wise and they will love you.
20009009 Instruct the wise and they will be wiser still; teach the righteous and they will add to their learning.
20009010 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
20009011 For through wisdom your days will be many, and years will be added to your life.
20009012 If you are wise, your wisdom will reward you; if you are a mocker, you alone will suffer.
20009013 Folly is an unruly woman; she is simple and knows nothing.
20009014 She sits at the door of her house, on a seat at the highest point of the city,
20009015 calling out to those who pass by, who go straight on their way,
20009016 “Let all who are simple come to my house!” To those who have no sense she says,
20009017 “Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is delicious!”
20009018 But little do they know that the dead are there, that her guests are deep in the realm of the dead.
20010001 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise son brings joy to his father, but a foolish son brings grief to his mother.
20010002 Ill-gotten treasures have no lasting value, but righteousness delivers from death.
20010003 The Lord does not let the righteous go hungry, but he thwarts the craving of the wicked.
20010004 Lazy hands make for poverty, but diligent hands bring wealth.
20010005 He who gathers crops in summer is a prudent son, but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgraceful son.
20010006 Blessings crown the head of the righteous, but violence overwhelms the mouth of the wicked.
20010007 The name of the righteous is used in blessings, but the name of the wicked will rot.
20010008 The wise in heart accept commands, but a chattering fool comes to ruin.
20010009 Whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out.
20010010 Whoever winks maliciously causes grief, and a chattering fool comes to ruin.
20010011 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.
20010012 Hatred stirs up conflict, but love covers over all wrongs.
20010013 Wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning, but a rod is for the back of one who has no sense.
20010014 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool invites ruin.
20010015 The wealth of the rich is their fortified city, but poverty is the ruin of the poor.
20010016 The wages of the righteous is life, but the earnings of the wicked are sin and death.
20010017 Whoever heeds discipline shows the way to life, but whoever ignores correction leads others astray.
20010018 Whoever conceals hatred with lying lips and spreads slander is a fool.
20010019 Sin is not ended by multiplying words, but the prudent hold their tongues.
20010020 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked is of little value.
20010021 The lips of the righteous nourish many, but fools die for lack of sense.
20010022 The blessing of the Lord brings wealth, without painful toil for it.
20010023 A fool finds pleasure in wicked schemes, but a person of understanding delights in wisdom.
20010024 What the wicked dread will overtake them; what the righteous desire will be granted.
20010025 When the storm has swept by, the wicked are gone, but the righteous stand firm forever.
20010026 As vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes, so are sluggards to those who send them.
20010027 The fear of the Lord adds length to life, but the years of the wicked are cut short.
20010028 The prospect of the righteous is joy, but the hopes of the wicked come to nothing.
20010029 The way of the Lord is a refuge for the blameless, but it is the ruin of those who do evil.
20010030 The righteous will never be uprooted, but the wicked will not remain in the land.
20010031 From the mouth of the righteous comes the fruit of wisdom, but a perverse tongue will be silenced.
20010032 The lips of the righteous know what finds favor, but the mouth of the wicked only what is perverse.
20011001 The Lord detests dishonest scales, but accurate weights find favor with him.
20011002 When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom.
20011003 The integrity of the upright guides them, but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity.
20011004 Wealth is worthless in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death.
20011005 The righteousness of the blameless makes their paths straight, but the wicked are brought down by their own wickedness.
20011006 The righteousness of the upright delivers them, but the unfaithful are trapped by evil desires.
20011007 Hopes placed in mortals die with them; all the promise of their power comes to nothing.
20011008 The righteous person is rescued from trouble, and it falls on the wicked instead.
20011009 With their mouths the godless destroy their neighbors, but through knowledge the righteous escape.
20011010 When the righteous prosper, the city rejoices; when the wicked perish, there are shouts of joy.
20011011 Through the blessing of the upright a city is exalted, but by the mouth of the wicked it is destroyed.
20011012 Whoever derides their neighbor has no sense, but the one who has understanding holds their tongue.
20011013 A gossip betrays a confidence, but a trustworthy person keeps a secret.
20011014 For lack of guidance a nation falls, but victory is won through many advisers.
20011015 Whoever puts up security for a stranger will surely suffer, but whoever refuses to shake hands in pledge is safe.
20011016 A kindhearted woman gains honor, but ruthless men gain only wealth.
20011017 Those who are kind benefit themselves, but the cruel bring ruin on themselves.
20011018 A wicked person earns deceptive wages, but the one who sows righteousness reaps a sure reward.
20011019 Truly the righteous attain life, but whoever pursues evil finds death.
20011020 The Lord detests those whose hearts are perverse, but he delights in those whose ways are blameless.
20011021 Be sure of this: The wicked will not go unpunished, but those who are righteous will go free.
20011022 Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout is a beautiful woman who shows no discretion.
20011023 The desire of the righteous ends only in good, but the hope of the wicked only in wrath.
20011024 One person gives freely, yet gains even more; another withholds unduly, but comes to poverty.
20011025 A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.
20011026 People curse the one who hoards grain, but they pray God’s blessing on the one who is willing to sell.
20011027 Whoever seeks good finds favor, but evil comes to one who searches for it.
20011028 Those who trust in their riches will fall, but the righteous will thrive like a green leaf.
20011029 Whoever brings ruin on their family will inherit only wind, and the fool will be servant to the wise.
20011030 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and the one who is wise saves lives.
20011031 If the righteous receive their due on earth, how much more the ungodly and the sinner!
20012001 Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but whoever hates correction is stupid.
20012002 Good people obtain favor from the Lord, but he condemns those who devise wicked schemes.
20012003 No one can be established through wickedness, but the righteous cannot be uprooted.
20012004 A wife of noble character is her husband’s crown, but a disgraceful wife is like decay in his bones.
20012005 The plans of the righteous are just, but the advice of the wicked is deceitful.
20012006 The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood, but the speech of the upright rescues them.
20012007 The wicked are overthrown and are no more, but the house of the righteous stands firm.
20012008 A person is praised according to their prudence, and one with a warped mind is despised.
20012009 Better to be a nobody and yet have a servant than pretend to be somebody and have no food.
20012010 The righteous care for the needs of their animals, but the kindest acts of the wicked are cruel.
20012011 Those who work their land will have abundant food, but those who chase fantasies have no sense.
20012012 The wicked desire the stronghold of evildoers, but the root of the righteous endures.
20012013 Evildoers are trapped by their sinful talk, and so the innocent escape trouble.
20012014 From the fruit of their lips people are filled with good things, and the work of their hands brings them reward.
20012015 The way of fools seems right to them, but the wise listen to advice.
20012016 Fools show their annoyance at once, but the prudent overlook an insult.
20012017 An honest witness tells the truth, but a false witness tells lies.
20012018 The words of the reckless pierce like swords, but the tongue of the wise brings healing.
20012019 Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue lasts only a moment.
20012020 Deceit is in the hearts of those who plot evil, but those who promote peace have joy.
20012021 No harm overtakes the righteous, but the wicked have their fill of trouble.
20012022 The Lord detests lying lips, but he delights in people who are trustworthy.
20012023 The prudent keep their knowledge to themselves, but a fool’s heart blurts out folly.
20012024 Diligent hands will rule, but laziness ends in forced labor.
20012025 Anxiety weighs down the heart, but a kind word cheers it up.
20012026 The righteous choose their friends carefully, but the way of the wicked leads them astray.
20012027 The lazy do not roast any game, but the diligent feed on the riches of the hunt.
20012028 In the way of righteousness there is life; along that path is immortality.
20013001 A wise son heeds his father’s instruction, but a mocker does not respond to rebukes.
20013002 From the fruit of their lips people enjoy good things, but the unfaithful have an appetite for violence.
20013003 Those who guard their lips preserve their lives, but those who speak rashly will come to ruin.
20013004 A sluggard’s appetite is never filled, but the desires of the diligent are fully satisfied.
20013005 The righteous hate what is false, but the wicked make themselves a stench and bring shame on themselves.
20013006 Righteousness guards the person of integrity, but wickedness overthrows the sinner.
20013007 One person pretends to be rich, yet has nothing; another pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth.
20013008 A person’s riches may ransom their life, but the poor cannot respond to threatening rebukes.
20013009 The light of the righteous shines brightly, but the lamp of the wicked is snuffed out.

20014019 Evildoers will bow down in the presence of the good, and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.

20014021 It is a sin to despise one’s neighbor, but blessed is the one who is kind to the needy.

20015004 The soothing tongue is a tree of life, but a perverse tongue crushes the spirit.
20015005 A fool spurns a parent’s discipline, but whoever heeds correction shows prudence.
20015006 The house of the righteous contains great treasure, but the income of the wicked brings ruin.

20015016 Better a little with the fear of the Lord than great wealth with turmoil.

20016001 To humans belong the plans of the heart, but from the Lord comes the proper answer of the tongue.

20016006 Through love and faithfulness sin is atoned for; through the fear of the Lord evil is avoided.
20016007 When the Lord takes pleasure in anyone’s way, he causes their enemies to make peace with them.
20016008 Better a little with righteousness than much gain with injustice.
20016009 In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps.
20016010 The lips of a king speak as an oracle, and his mouth does not betray justice.
20016011 Honest scales and balances belong to the Lord; all the weights in the bag are of his making.

20016013 Kings take pleasure in honest lips; they value the one who speaks what is right.
20016014 A king’s wrath is a messenger of death, but the wise will appease it.
20016015 When a king’s face brightens, it means life; his favor is like a rain cloud in spring.
20016016 How much better to get wisdom than gold, to get insight rather than silver!
20016017 The highway of the upright avoids evil; those who guard their ways preserve their lives.
20016018 Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.
20016019 Better to be lowly in spirit along with the oppressed than to share plunder with the proud.
20016020 Whoever gives heed to instruction prospers, and blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord.

20016024 Gracious words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.
20016025 There is a way that appears to be right, but in the end it leads to death.
20016026 The appetite of laborers works for them; their hunger drives them on.
20016027 A scoundrel plots evil, and on their lips it is like a scorching fire.
20016028 A perverse person stirs up conflict, and a gossip separates close friends.
20016029 A violent person entices their neighbor and leads them down a path that is not good.
20016030 Whoever winks with their eye is plotting perversity; whoever purses their lips is bent on evil.
20016031 Gray hair is a crown of splendor; it is attained in the way of righteousness.
20016032 Better a patient person than a warrior, one with self-control than one who takes a city.
20016033 The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord.
20017001 Better a dry crust with peace and quiet than a house full of feasting, with strife.
20017002 A prudent servant will rule over a disgraceful son and will share the inheritance as one of the family.
20017003 The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but the Lord tests the heart.
20017004 A wicked person listens to deceitful lips; a liar pays attention to a destructive tongue.
20017005 Whoever mocks the poor shows contempt for their Maker; whoever gloats over disaster will not go unpunished.
20017006 Children’s children are a crown to the aged, and parents are the pride of their children.
20017007 Eloquent lips are unsuited to a godless fool— how much worse lying lips to a ruler!
20017008 A bribe is seen as a charm by the one who gives it; they think success will come at every turn.
20017009 Whoever would foster love covers over an offense, but whoever repeats the matter separates close friends.
20017010 A rebuke impresses a discerning person more than a hundred lashes a fool.
20017011 Evildoers foster rebellion against God; the messenger of death will be sent against them.
20017012 Better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs than a fool bent on folly.
20017013 Evil will never leave the house of one who pays back evil for good.
20017014 Starting a quarrel is like breaching a dam; so drop the matter before a dispute breaks out.
20017015 Acquitting the guilty and condemning the innocent— the Lord detests them both.
20017016 Why should fools have money in hand to buy wisdom, when they are not able to understand it?
20017017 A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for a time of adversity.
20017018 One who has no sense shakes hands in pledge and puts up security for a neighbor.
20017019 Whoever loves a quarrel loves sin; whoever builds a high gate invites destruction.
20017020 One whose heart is corrupt does not prosper; one whose tongue is perverse falls into trouble.
20017021 To have a fool for a child brings grief; there is no joy for the parent of a godless fool.
20017022 A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.
20017023 The wicked accept bribes in secret to pervert the course of justice.
20017024 A discerning person keeps wisdom in view, but a fool’s eyes wander to the ends of the earth.
20017025 A foolish son brings grief to his father and bitterness to the mother who bore him.
20017026 If imposing a fine on the innocent is not good, surely to flog honest officials is not right.
20017027 The one who has knowledge uses words with restraint, and whoever has understanding is even-tempered.
20017028 Even fools are thought wise if they keep silent, and discerning if they hold their tongues.
20018001 An unfriendly person pursues selfish ends and against all sound judgment starts quarrels.
20018002 Fools find no pleasure in understanding but delight in airing their own opinions.
20018003 When wickedness comes, so does contempt, and with shame comes reproach.
20018004 The words of the mouth are deep waters, but the fountain of wisdom is a rushing stream.
20018005 It is not good to be partial to the wicked and so deprive the innocent of justice.
20018006 The lips of fools bring them strife, and their mouths invite a beating.
20018007 The mouths of fools are their undoing, and their lips are a snare to their very lives.
20018008 The words of a gossip are like choice morsels; they go down to the inmost parts.
20018009 One who is slack in his work is brother to one who destroys.
20018010 The name of the Lord is a fortified tower; the righteous run to it and are safe.
20018011 The wealth of the rich is their fortified city; they imagine it a wall too high to scale.
20018012 Before a downfall the heart is haughty, but humility comes before honor.
20018013 To answer before listening— that is folly and shame.
20018014 The human spirit can endure in sickness, but a crushed spirit who can bear?
20018015 The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge, for the ears of the wise seek it out.
20018016 A gift opens the way and ushers the giver into the presence of the great.
20018017 In a lawsuit the first to speak seems right, until someone comes forward and cross-examines.
20018018 Casting the lot settles disputes and keeps strong opponents apart.
20018019 A brother wronged is more unyielding than a fortified city; disputes are like the barred gates of a citadel.
20018020 From the fruit of their mouth a person’s stomach is filled; with the harvest of their lips they are satisfied.
20018021 The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit.
20018022 He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord.
20018023 The poor plead for mercy, but the rich answer harshly.
20018024 One who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.
20019001 Better the poor whose walk is blameless than a fool whose lips are perverse.
20019002 Desire without knowledge is not good— how much more will hasty feet miss the way!
20019003 A person’s own folly leads to their ruin, yet their heart rages against the Lord.
20019004 Wealth attracts many friends, but even the closest friend of the poor person deserts them.
20019005 A false witness will not go unpunished, and whoever pours out lies will not go free.
20019006 Many curry favor with a ruler, and everyone is the friend of one who gives gifts.
20019007 The poor are shunned by all their relatives— how much more do their friends avoid them! Though the poor pursue them with pleading, they are nowhere to be found.
20019008 The one who gets wisdom loves life; the one who cherishes understanding will soon prosper.
20019009 A false witness will not go unpunished, and whoever pours out lies will perish.
20019010 It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury— how much worse for a slave to rule over princes!
20019011 A person’s wisdom yields patience; it is to one’s glory to overlook an offense.
20019012 A king’s rage is like the roar of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass.
20019013 A foolish child is a father’s ruin, and a quarrelsome wife is like the constant dripping of a leaky roof.
20019014 Houses and wealth are inherited from parents, but a prudent wife is from the Lord.
20019015 Laziness brings on deep sleep, and the shiftless go hungry.
20019016 Whoever keeps commandments keeps their life, but whoever shows contempt for their ways will die.
20019017 Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the Lord, and he will reward them for what they have done.
20019018 Discipline your children, for in that there is hope; do not be a willing party to their death.
20019019 A hot-tempered person must pay the penalty; rescue them, and you will have to do it again.
20019020 Listen to advice and accept discipline, and at the end you will be counted among the wise.
20019021 Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the Lord’s purpose that prevails.
20019022 What a person desires is unfailing love ; better to be poor than a liar.
20019023 The fear of the Lord leads to life; then one rests content, untouched by trouble.
20019024 A sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he will not even bring it back to his mouth!
20019025 Flog a mocker, and the simple will learn prudence; rebuke the discerning, and they will gain knowledge.
20019026 Whoever robs their father and drives out their mother is a child who brings shame and disgrace.
20019027 Stop listening to instruction, my son, and you will stray from the words of knowledge.
20019028 A corrupt witness mocks at justice, and the mouth of the wicked gulps down evil.
20019029 Penalties are prepared for mockers, and beatings for the backs of fools.
20020001 Wine is a mocker and beer a brawler; whoever is led astray by them is not wise.
20020002 A king’s wrath strikes terror like the roar of a lion; those who anger him forfeit their lives.
20020003 It is to one’s honor to avoid strife, but every fool is quick to quarrel.
20020004 Sluggards do not plow in season; so at harvest time they look but find nothing.
20020005 The purposes of a person’s heart are deep waters, but one who has insight draws them out.
20020006 Many claim to have unfailing love, but a faithful person who can find?
20020007 The righteous lead blameless lives; blessed are their children after them.
20020008 When a king sits on his throne to judge, he winnows out all evil with his eyes.
20020009 Who can say, “I have kept my heart pure; I am clean and without sin”?
20020010 Differing weights and differing measures— the Lord detests them both.
20020011 Even small children are known by their actions, so is their conduct really pure and upright?
20020012 Ears that hear and eyes that see— the Lord has made them both.
20020013 Do not love sleep or you will grow poor; stay awake and you will have food to spare.
20020014 “It’s no good, it’s no good!” says the buyer— then goes off and boasts about the purchase.
20020015 Gold there is, and rubies in abundance, but lips that speak knowledge are a rare jewel.
20020016 Take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger; hold it in pledge if it is done for an outsider.
20020017 Food gained by fraud tastes sweet, but one ends up with a mouth full of gravel.
20020018 Plans are established by seeking advice; so if you wage war, obtain guidance.
20020019 A gossip betrays a confidence; so avoid anyone who talks too much.
20020020 If someone curses their father or mother, their lamp will be snuffed out in pitch darkness.
20020021 An inheritance claimed too soon will not be blessed at the end.
20020022 Do not say, “I’ll pay you back for this wrong!” Wait for the Lord, and he will avenge you.
20020023 The Lord detests differing weights, and dishonest scales do not please him.
20020024 A person’s steps are directed by the Lord. How then can anyone understand their own way?
20020025 It is a trap to dedicate something rashly and only later to consider one’s vows.
20020026 A wise king winnows out the wicked; he drives the threshing wheel over them.
20020027 The human spirit is the lamp of the Lord that sheds light on one’s inmost being.
20020028 Love and faithfulness keep a king safe; through love his throne is made secure.
20020029 The glory of young men is their strength, gray hair the splendor of the old.
20020030 Blows and wounds scrub away evil, and beatings purge the inmost being.
20021001 In the Lord’s hand the king’s heart is a stream of water that he channels toward all who please him.
20021002 A person may think their own ways are right, but the Lord weighs the heart.
20021003 To do what is right and just is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.
20021004 Haughty eyes and a proud heart— the unplowed field of the wicked—produce sin.
20021005 The plans of the diligent lead to profit as surely as haste leads to poverty.
20021006 A fortune made by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a deadly snare.
20021007 The violence of the wicked will drag them away, for they refuse to do what is right.
20021008 The way of the guilty is devious, but the conduct of the innocent is upright.
20021009 Better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife.
20021010 The wicked crave evil; their neighbors get no mercy from them.
20021011 When a mocker is punished, the simple gain wisdom; by paying attention to the wise they get knowledge.
20021012 The Righteous One takes note of the house of the wicked and brings the wicked to ruin.
20021013 Whoever shuts their ears to the cry of the poor will also cry out and not be answered.
20021014 A gift given in secret soothes anger, and a bribe concealed in the cloak pacifies great wrath.
20021015 When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous but terror to evildoers.
20021016 Whoever strays from the path of prudence comes to rest in the company of the dead.
20021017 Whoever loves pleasure will become poor; whoever loves wine and olive oil will never be rich.
20021018 The wicked become a ransom for the righteous, and the unfaithful for the upright.
20021019 Better to live in a desert than with a quarrelsome and nagging wife.
20021020 The wise store up choice food and olive oil, but fools gulp theirs down.
20021021 Whoever pursues righteousness and love finds life, prosperity and honor.
20021022 One who is wise can go up against the city of the mighty and pull down the stronghold in which they trust.
20021023 Those who guard their mouths and their tongues keep themselves from calamity.
20021024 The proud and arrogant person—“Mocker” is his name— behaves with insolent fury.
20021025 The craving of a sluggard will be the death of him, because his hands refuse to work.
20021026 All day long he craves for more, but the righteous give without sparing.
20021027 The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable— how much more so when brought with evil intent!
20021028 A false witness will perish, but a careful listener will testify successfully.
20021029 The wicked put up a bold front, but the upright give thought to their ways.
20021030 There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan that can succeed against the Lord.
20021031 The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but victory rests with the Lord.
20022001 A good name is more desirable than great riches; to be esteemed is better than silver or gold.
20022002 Rich and poor have this in common: The Lord is the Maker of them all.
20022003 The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.
20022004 Humility is the fear of the Lord; its wages are riches and honor and life.
20022005 In the paths of the wicked are snares and pitfalls, but those who would preserve their life stay far from them.
20022006 Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it.
20022007 The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is slave to the lender.
20022008 Whoever sows injustice reaps calamity, and the rod they wield in fury will be broken.
20022009 The generous will themselves be blessed, for they share their food with the poor.
20022010 Drive out the mocker, and out goes strife; quarrels and insults are ended.
20022011 One who loves a pure heart and who speaks with grace will have the king for a friend.
20022012 The eyes of the Lord keep watch over knowledge, but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful.
20022013 The sluggard says, “There’s a lion outside! I’ll be killed in the public square!”
20022014 The mouth of an adulterous woman is a deep pit; a man who is under the Lord’s wrath falls into it.
20022015 Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline will drive it far away.
20022016 One who oppresses the poor to increase his wealth and one who gives gifts to the rich—both come to poverty.
20022017 Pay attention and turn your ear to the sayings of the wise; apply your heart to what I teach,
20022018 for it is pleasing when you keep them in your heart and have all of them ready on your lips.
20022019 So that your trust may be in the Lord, I teach you today, even you.
20022020 Have I not written thirty sayings for you, sayings of counsel and knowledge,
20022021 teaching you to be honest and to speak the truth, so that you bring back truthful reports to those you serve?
20022022 Do not exploit the poor because they are poor and do not crush the needy in court,
20022023 for the Lord will take up their case and will exact life for life.
20022024 Do not make friends with a hot-tempered person, do not associate with one easily angered,
20022025 or you may learn their ways and get yourself ensnared.
20022026 Do not be one who shakes hands in pledge or puts up security for debts;
20022027 if you lack the means to pay, your very bed will be snatched from under you.
20022028 Do not move an ancient boundary stone set up by your ancestors.
20022029 Do you see someone skilled in their work? They will serve before kings; they will not serve before officials of low rank.
20023001 When you sit to dine with a ruler, note well what is before you,
20023002 and put a knife to your throat if you are given to gluttony.
20023003 Do not crave his delicacies, for that food is deceptive.
20023004 Do not wear yourself out to get rich; do not trust your own cleverness.
20023005 Cast but a glance at riches, and they are gone, for they will surely sprout wings and fly off to the sky like an eagle.
20023006 Do not eat the food of a begrudging host, do not crave his delicacies;
20023007 for he is the kind of person who is always thinking about the cost. “Eat and drink,” he says to you, but his heart is not with you.
20023008 You will vomit up the little you have eaten and will have wasted your compliments.
20023009 Do not speak to fools, for they will scorn your prudent words.
20023010 Do not move an ancient boundary stone or encroach on the fields of the fatherless,
20023011 for their Defender is strong; he will take up their case against you.
20023012 Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to words of knowledge.
20023013 Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you punish them with the rod, they will not die.
20023014 Punish them with the rod and save them from death.
20023015 My son, if your heart is wise, then my heart will be glad indeed;
20023016 my inmost being will rejoice when your lips speak what is right.
20023017 Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always be zealous for the fear of the Lord.
20023018 There is surely a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off.
20023019 Listen, my son, and be wise, and set your heart on the right path:
20023020 Do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat,
20023021 for drunkards and gluttons become poor, and drowsiness clothes them in rags.
20023022 Listen to your father, who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old.
20023023 Buy the truth and do not sell it— wisdom, instruction and insight as well.
20023024 The father of a righteous child has great joy; a man who fathers a wise son rejoices in him.
20023025 May your father and mother rejoice; may she who gave you birth be joyful!
20023026 My son, give me your heart and let your eyes delight in my ways,
20023027 for an adulterous woman is a deep pit, and a wayward wife is a narrow well.
20023028 Like a bandit she lies in wait and multiplies the unfaithful among men.
20023029 Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes?
20023030 Those who linger over wine, who go to sample bowls of mixed wine.
20023031 Do not gaze at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly!
20023032 In the end it bites like a snake and poisons like a viper.
20023033 Your eyes will see strange sights, and your mind will imagine confusing things.
20023034 You will be like one sleeping on the high seas, lying on top of the rigging.
20023035 “They hit me,” you will say, “but I’m not hurt! They beat me, but I don’t feel it! When will I wake up so I can find another drink?”
20024001 Do not envy the wicked, do not desire their company;
20024002 for their hearts plot violence, and their lips talk about making trouble.
20024003 By wisdom a house is built, and through understanding it is established;
20024004 through knowledge its rooms are filled with rare and beautiful treasures.
20024005 The wise prevail through great power, and those who have knowledge muster their strength.
20024006 Surely you need guidance to wage war, and victory is won through many advisers.
20024007 Wisdom is too high for fools; in the assembly at the gate they must not open their mouths.
20024008 Whoever plots evil will be known as a schemer.
20024009 The schemes of folly are sin, and people detest a mocker.
20024010 If you falter in a time of trouble, how small is your strength!
20024011 Rescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering toward slaughter.
20024012 If you say, “But we knew nothing about this,” does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who guards your life know it? Will he not repay everyone according to what they have done?
20024013 Eat honey, my son, for it is good; honey from the comb is sweet to your taste.
20024014 Know also that wisdom is like honey for you: If you find it, there is a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off.
20024015 Do not lurk like a thief near the house of the righteous, do not plunder their dwelling place;
20024016 for though the righteous fall seven times, they rise again, but the wicked stumble when calamity strikes.
20024017 Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice,
20024018 or the Lord will see and disapprove and turn his wrath away from them.
20024019 Do not fret because of evildoers or be envious of the wicked,
20024020 for the evildoer has no future hope, and the lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out.
20024021 Fear the Lord and the king, my son, and do not join with rebellious officials,
20024022 for those two will send sudden destruction on them, and who knows what calamities they can bring?
20024023 These also are sayings of the wise: To show partiality in judging is not good:
20024024 Whoever says to the guilty, “You are innocent,” will be cursed by peoples and denounced by nations.
20024025 But it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and rich blessing will come on them.
20024026 An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips.
20024027 Put your outdoor work in order and get your fields ready; after that, build your house.
20024028 Do not testify against your neighbor without cause— would you use your lips to mislead?
20024029 Do not say, “I’ll do to them as they have done to me; I’ll pay them back for what they did.”
20024030 I went past the field of a sluggard, past the vineyard of someone who has no sense;
20024031 thorns had come up everywhere, the ground was covered with weeds, and the stone wall was in ruins.
20024032 I applied my heart to what I observed and learned a lesson from what I saw:
20024033 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest—
20024034 and poverty will come on you like a thief and scarcity like an armed man.
20025001 These are more proverbs of Solomon, compiled by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah:
20025002 It is the glory of God to conceal a matter; to search out a matter is the glory of kings.
20025003 As the heavens are high and the earth is deep, so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.
20025004 Remove the dross from the silver, and a silversmith can produce a vessel;
20025005 remove wicked officials from the king’s presence, and his throne will be established through righteousness.
20025006 Do not exalt yourself in the king’s presence, and do not claim a place among his great men;
20025007 it is better for him to say to you, “Come up here,” than for him to humiliate you before his nobles. What you have seen with your eyes
20025008 do not bring hastily to court, for what will you do in the end if your neighbor puts you to shame?
20025009 If you take your neighbor to court, do not betray another’s confidence,
20025010 or the one who hears it may shame you and the charge against you will stand.
20025011 Like apples of gold in settings of silver is a ruling rightly given.
20025012 Like an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold is the rebuke of a wise judge to a listening ear.
20025013 Like a snow-cooled drink at harvest time is a trustworthy messenger to the one who sends him; he refreshes the spirit of his master.
20025014 Like clouds and wind without rain is one who boasts of gifts never given.
20025015 Through patience a ruler can be persuaded, and a gentle tongue can break a bone.
20025016 If you find honey, eat just enough— too much of it, and you will vomit.
20025017 Seldom set foot in your neighbor’s house— too much of you, and they will hate you.
20025018 Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow is one who gives false testimony against a neighbor.
20025019 Like a broken tooth or a lame foot is reliance on the unfaithful in a time of trouble.
20025020 Like one who takes away a garment on a cold day, or like vinegar poured on a wound, is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.
20025021 If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.
20025022 In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, and the Lord will reward you.
20025023 Like a north wind that brings unexpected rain is a sly tongue—which provokes a horrified look.
20025024 Better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife.
20025025 Like cold water to a weary soul is good news from a distant land.
20025026 Like a muddied spring or a polluted well are the righteous who give way to the wicked.
20025027 It is not good to eat too much honey, nor is it honorable to search out matters that are too deep.
20025028 Like a city whose walls are broken through is a person who lacks self-control.
20026001 Like snow in summer or rain in harvest, honor is not fitting for a fool.
20026002 Like a fluttering sparrow or a darting swallow, an undeserved curse does not come to rest.
20026003 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the backs of fools!
20026004 Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you yourself will be just like him.
20026005 Answer a fool according to his folly, or he will be wise in his own eyes.
20026006 Sending a message by the hands of a fool is like cutting off one’s feet or drinking poison.
20026007 Like the useless legs of one who is lame is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
20026008 Like tying a stone in a sling is the giving of honor to a fool.
20026009 Like a thornbush in a drunkard’s hand is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
20026010 Like an archer who wounds at random is one who hires a fool or any passer-by.
20026011 As a dog returns to its vomit, so fools repeat their folly.
20026012 Do you see a person wise in their own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for them.
20026013 A sluggard says, “There’s a lion in the road, a fierce lion roaming the streets!”
20026014 As a door turns on its hinges, so a sluggard turns on his bed.
20026015 A sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.
20026016 A sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven people who answer discreetly.
20026017 Like one who grabs a stray dog by the ears is someone who rushes into a quarrel not their own.
20026018 Like a maniac shooting flaming arrows of death
20026019 is one who deceives their neighbor and says, “I was only joking!”
20026020 Without wood a fire goes out; without a gossip a quarrel dies down.
20026021 As charcoal to embers and as wood to fire, so is a quarrelsome person for kindling strife.
20026022 The words of a gossip are like choice morsels; they go down to the inmost parts.
20026023 Like a coating of silver dross on earthenware are fervent lips with an evil heart.
20026024 Enemies disguise themselves with their lips, but in their hearts they harbor deceit.
20026025 Though their speech is charming, do not believe them, for seven abominations fill their hearts.
20026026 Their malice may be concealed by deception, but their wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.
20026027 Whoever digs a pit will fall into it; if someone rolls a stone, it will roll back on them.
20026028 A lying tongue hates those it hurts, and a flattering mouth works ruin.
20027001 Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring.
20027002 Let someone else praise you, and not your own mouth; an outsider, and not your own lips.
20027003 Stone is heavy and sand a burden, but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both.
20027004 Anger is cruel and fury overwhelming, but who can stand before jealousy?
20027005 Better is open rebuke than hidden love.
20027006 Wounds from a friend can be trusted, but an enemy multiplies kisses.
20027007 One who is full loathes honey from the comb, but to the hungry even what is bitter tastes sweet.
20027008 Like a bird that flees its nest is anyone who flees from home.
20027009 Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart, and the pleasantness of a friend springs from their heartfelt advice.
20027010 Do not forsake your friend or a friend of your family, and do not go to your relative’s house when disaster strikes you— better a neighbor nearby than a relative far away.
20027011 Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart; then I can answer anyone who treats me with contempt.
20027012 The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.
20027013 Take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger; hold it in pledge if it is done for an outsider.
20027014 If anyone loudly blesses their neighbor early in the morning, it will be taken as a curse.
20027015 A quarrelsome wife is like the dripping of a leaky roof in a rainstorm;
20027016 restraining her is like restraining the wind or grasping oil with the hand.
20027017 As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.
20027018 The one who guards a fig tree will eat its fruit, and whoever protects their master will be honored.
20027019 As water reflects the face, so one’s life reflects the heart.
20027020 Death and Destruction are never satisfied, and neither are human eyes.
20027021 The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but people are tested by their praise.
20027022 Though you grind a fool in a mortar, grinding them like grain with a pestle, you will not remove their folly from them.
20027023 Be sure you know the condition of your flocks, give careful attention to your herds;
20027024 for riches do not endure forever, and a crown is not secure for all generations.
20027025 When the hay is removed and new growth appears and the grass from the hills is gathered in,
20027026 the lambs will provide you with clothing, and the goats with the price of a field.
20027027 You will have plenty of goats’ milk to feed your family and to nourish your female servants.
20028001 The wicked flee though no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.
20028002 When a country is rebellious, it has many rulers, but a ruler with discernment and knowledge maintains order.
20028003 A ruler who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain that leaves no crops.
20028004 Those who forsake instruction praise the wicked, but those who heed it resist them.
20028005 Evildoers do not understand what is right, but those who seek the Lord understand it fully.
20028006 Better the poor whose walk is blameless than the rich whose ways are perverse.
20028007 A discerning son heeds instruction, but a companion of gluttons disgraces his father.
20028008 Whoever increases wealth by taking interest or profit from the poor amasses it for another, who will be kind to the poor.
20028009 If anyone turns a deaf ear to my instruction, even their prayers are detestable.
20028010 Whoever leads the upright along an evil path will fall into their own trap, but the blameless will receive a good inheritance.
20028011 The rich are wise in their own eyes; one who is poor and discerning sees how deluded they are.
20028012 When the righteous triumph, there is great elation; but when the wicked rise to power, people go into hiding.
20028013 Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy.
20028014 Blessed is the one who always trembles before God, but whoever hardens their heart falls into trouble.
20028015 Like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked ruler over a helpless people.
20028016 A tyrannical ruler practices extortion, but one who hates ill-gotten gain will enjoy a long reign.
20028017 Anyone tormented by the guilt of murder will seek refuge in the grave; let no one hold them back.
20028018 The one whose walk is blameless is kept safe, but the one whose ways are perverse will fall into the pit.
20028019 Those who work their land will have abundant food, but those who chase fantasies will have their fill of poverty.
20028020 A faithful person will be richly blessed, but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished.
20028021 To show partiality is not good— yet a person will do wrong for a piece of bread.
20028022 The stingy are eager to get rich and are unaware that poverty awaits them.
20028023 Whoever rebukes a person will in the end gain favor rather than one who has a flattering tongue.
20028024 Whoever robs their father or mother and says, “It’s not wrong,” is partner to one who destroys.
20028025 The greedy stir up conflict, but those who trust in the Lord will prosper.
20028026 Those who trust in themselves are fools, but those who walk in wisdom are kept safe.
20028027 Those who give to the poor will lack nothing, but those who close their eyes to them receive many curses.
20028028 When the wicked rise to power, people go into hiding; but when the wicked perish, the righteous thrive.
20029001 Whoever remains stiff-necked after many rebukes will suddenly be destroyed—without remedy.
20029002 When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice; when the wicked rule, the people groan.
20029003 A man who loves wisdom brings joy to his father, but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth.
20029004 By justice a king gives a country stability, but those who are greedy for bribes tear it down.
20029005 Those who flatter their neighbors are spreading nets for their feet.
20029006 Evildoers are snared by their own sin, but the righteous shout for joy and are glad.
20029007 The righteous care about justice for the poor, but the wicked have no such concern.
20029008 Mockers stir up a city, but the wise turn away anger.
20029009 If a wise person goes to court with a fool, the fool rages and scoffs, and there is no peace.
20029010 The bloodthirsty hate a person of integrity and seek to kill the upright.
20029011 Fools give full vent to their rage, but the wise bring calm in the end.
20029012 If a ruler listens to lies, all his officials become wicked.
20029013 The poor and the oppressor have this in common: The Lord gives sight to the eyes of both.
20029014 If a king judges the poor with fairness, his throne will be established forever.
20029015 A rod and a reprimand impart wisdom, but a child left undisciplined disgraces its mother.
20029016 When the wicked thrive, so does sin, but the righteous will see their downfall.
20029017 Discipline your children, and they will give you peace; they will bring you the delights you desire.
20029018 Where there is no revelation, people cast off restraint; but blessed is the one who heeds wisdom’s instruction.
20029019 Servants cannot be corrected by mere words; though they understand, they will not respond.
20029020 Do you see someone who speaks in haste? There is more hope for a fool than for them.
20029021 A servant pampered from youth will turn out to be insolent.
20029022 An angry person stirs up conflict, and a hot-tempered person commits many sins.
20029023 Pride brings a person low, but the lowly in spirit gain honor.
20029024 The accomplices of thieves are their own enemies; they are put under oath and dare not testify.
20029025 Fear of man will prove to be a snare, but whoever trusts in the Lord is kept safe.
20029026 Many seek an audience with a ruler, but it is from the Lord that one gets justice.
20029027 The righteous detest the dishonest; the wicked detest the upright.
20030001 The sayings of Agur son of Jakeh—an inspired utterance. This man’s utterance to Ithiel: “I am weary, God, but I can prevail.
20030002 Surely I am only a brute, not a man; I do not have human understanding.
20030003 I have not learned wisdom, nor have I attained to the knowledge of the Holy One.
20030004 Who has gone up to heaven and come down? Whose hands have gathered up the wind? Who has wrapped up the waters in a cloak? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is the name of his son? Surely you know!
20030005 “Every word of God is flawless; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
20030006 Do not add to his words, or he will rebuke you and prove you a liar.
20030007 “Two things I ask of you, Lord; do not refuse me before I die:
20030008 Keep falsehood and lies far from me; give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread.
20030009 Otherwise, I may have too much and disown you and say, ‘Who is the Lord?’ Or I may become poor and steal, and so dishonor the name of my God.
20030010 “Do not slander a servant to their master, or they will curse you, and you will pay for it.
20030011 “There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers;
20030012 those who are pure in their own eyes and yet are not cleansed of their filth;
20030013 those whose eyes are ever so haughty, whose glances are so disdainful;
20030014 those whose teeth are swords and whose jaws are set with knives to devour the poor from the earth and the needy from among mankind.
20030015 “The leech has two daughters. ‘Give! Give!’ they cry. “There are three things that are never satisfied, four that never say, ‘Enough!’:
20030016 the grave, the barren womb, land, which is never satisfied with water, and fire, which never says, ‘Enough!’
20030017 “The eye that mocks a father, that scorns an aged mother, will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley, will be eaten by the vultures.
20030018 “There are three things that are too amazing for me, four that I do not understand:
20030019 the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a young woman.
20030020 “This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats and wipes her mouth and says, ‘I’ve done nothing wrong.’
20030021 “Under three things the earth trembles, under four it cannot bear up:
20030022 a servant who becomes king, a godless fool who gets plenty to eat,
20030023 a contemptible woman who gets married, and a servant who displaces her mistress.
20030024 “Four things on earth are small, yet they are extremely wise:
20030025 Ants are creatures of little strength, yet they store up their food in the summer;
20030026 hyraxes are creatures of little power, yet they make their home in the crags;
20030027 locusts have no king, yet they advance together in ranks;
20030028 a lizard can be caught with the hand, yet it is found in kings’ palaces.
20030029 “There are three things that are stately in their stride, four that move with stately bearing:
20030030 a lion, mighty among beasts, who retreats before nothing;
20030031 a strutting rooster, a he-goat, and a king secure against revolt.
20030032 “If you play the fool and exalt yourself, or if you plan evil, clap your hand over your mouth!
20030033 For as churning cream produces butter, and as twisting the nose produces blood, so stirring up anger produces strife.”
20031001 The sayings of King Lemuel—an inspired utterance his mother taught him.
20031002 Listen, my son! Listen, son of my womb! Listen, my son, the answer to my prayers!
20031003 Do not spend your strength on women, your vigor on those who ruin kings.
20031004 It is not for kings, Lemuel— it is not for kings to drink wine, not for rulers to crave beer,
20031005 lest they drink and forget what has been decreed, and deprive all the oppressed of their rights.
20031006 Let beer be for those who are perishing, wine for those who are in anguish!
20031007 Let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more.
20031008 Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute.
20031009 Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy.
20031010 A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies.
20031011 Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value.
20031012 She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life.
20031013 She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands.
20031014 She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar.
20031015 She gets up while it is still night; she provides food for her family and portions for her female servants.
20031016 She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard.
20031017 She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks.
20031018 She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night.
20031019 In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers.
20031020 She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy.
20031021 When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet.
20031022 She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple.
20031023 Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land.
20031024 She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes.
20031025 She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come.
20031026 She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue.
20031027 She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.
20031028 Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:
20031029 “Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.”
20031030 Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.
20031031 Honor her for all that her hands have done, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.
21001001 The words of the Teacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem:
21001002 “Meaningless! Meaningless!” says the Teacher. “Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless.”
21001003 What do people gain from all their labors at which they toil under the sun?
21001004 Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever.
21001005 The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to where it rises.
21001006 The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course.
21001007 All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again.
21001008 All things are wearisome, more than one can say. The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing.
21001009 What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.
21001010 Is there anything of which one can say, “Look! This is something new”? It was here already, long ago; it was here before our time.
21001011 No one remembers the former generations, and even those yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow them.
21001012 I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
21001013 I applied my mind to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. What a heavy burden God has laid on mankind!
21001014 I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
21001015 What is crooked cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted.
21001016 I said to myself, “Look, I have increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge.”
21001017 Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.
21001018 For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief.
21002001 I said to myself, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good.” But that also proved to be meaningless.
21002002 “Laughter,” I said, “is madness. And what does pleasure accomplish?”
21002003 I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly—my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was good for people to do under the heavens during the few days of their lives.
21002004 I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards.
21002005 I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.
21002006 I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees.
21002007 I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me.
21002008 I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired male and female singers, and a harem as well—the delights of a man’s heart.
21002009 I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me.
21002010 I denied myself nothing my eyes desired; I refused my heart no pleasure. My heart took delight in all my labor, and this was the reward for all my toil.
21002011 Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind; nothing was gained under the sun.
21002012 Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom, and also madness and folly. What more can the king’s successor do than what has already been done?
21002013 I saw that wisdom is better than folly, just as light is better than darkness.
21002014 The wise have eyes in their heads, while the fool walks in the darkness; but I came to realize that the same fate overtakes them both.
21002015 Then I said to myself, “The fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise?” I said to myself, “This too is meaningless.”
21002016 For the wise, like the fool, will not be long remembered; the days have already come when both have been forgotten. Like the fool, the wise too must die!
21002017 So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
21002018 I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.
21002019 And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.
21002020 So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun.
21002021 For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.
21002022 What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun?
21002023 All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.
21002024 A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God,
21002025 for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?
21002026 To the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
21003001 There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens:
21003002 a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot,
21003003 a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build,
21003004 a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance,
21003005 a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,
21003006 a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away,
21003007 a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak,
21003008 a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace.
21003009 What do workers gain from their toil?
21003010 I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race.
21003011 He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.
21003012 I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live.
21003013 That each of them may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all their toil—this is the gift of God.
21003014 I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that people will fear him.
21003015 Whatever is has already been, and what will be has been before; and God will call the past to account.
21003016 And I saw something else under the sun: In the place of judgment—wickedness was there, in the place of justice—wickedness was there.
21003017 I said to myself, “God will bring into judgment both the righteous and the wicked, for there will be a time for every activity, a time to judge every deed.”
21003018 I also said to myself, “As for humans, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals.
21003019 Surely the fate of human beings is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath ; humans have no advantage over animals. Everything is meaningless.
21003020 All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return.
21003021 Who knows if the human spirit rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?”
21003022 So I saw that there is nothing better for a person than to enjoy their work, because that is their lot. For who can bring them to see what will happen after them?
21004001 Again I looked and saw all the oppression that was taking place under the sun: I saw the tears of the oppressed— and they have no comforter; power was on the side of their oppressors— and they have no comforter.
21004002 And I declared that the dead, who had already died, are happier than the living, who are still alive.
21004003 But better than both is the one who has never been born, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun.
21004004 And I saw that all toil and all achievement spring from one person’s envy of another. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
21004005 Fools fold their hands and ruin themselves.
21004006 Better one handful with tranquillity than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind.
21004007 Again I saw something meaningless under the sun:
21004008 There was a man all alone; he had neither son nor brother. There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content with his wealth. “For whom am I toiling,” he asked, “and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?” This too is meaningless— a miserable business!
21004009 Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor:
21004010 If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up.
21004011 Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone?
21004012 Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.
21004013 Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to heed a warning.
21004014 The youth may have come from prison to the kingship, or he may have been born in poverty within his kingdom.
21004015 I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed the youth, the king’s successor.
21004016 There was no end to all the people who were before them. But those who came later were not pleased with the successor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
21005001 Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. Go near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools, who do not know that they do wrong.
21005002 Do not be quick with your mouth, do not be hasty in your heart to utter anything before God. God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few.
21005003 A dream comes when there are many cares, and many words mark the speech of a fool.
21005004 When you make a vow to God, do not delay to fulfill it. He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vow.
21005005 It is better not to make a vow than to make one and not fulfill it.
21005006 Do not let your mouth lead you into sin. And do not protest to the temple messenger, “My vow was a mistake.” Why should God be angry at what you say and destroy the work of your hands?
21005007 Much dreaming and many words are meaningless. Therefore fear God.
21005008 If you see the poor oppressed in a district, and justice and rights denied, do not be surprised at such things; for one official is eyed by a higher one, and over them both are others higher still.
21005009 The increase from the land is taken by all; the king himself profits from the fields.
21005010 Whoever loves money never has enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income. This too is meaningless.
21005011 As goods increase, so do those who consume them. And what benefit are they to the owners except to feast their eyes on them?
21005012 The sleep of a laborer is sweet, whether they eat little or much, but as for the rich, their abundance permits them no sleep.
21005013 I have seen a grievous evil under the sun: wealth hoarded to the harm of its owners,
21005014 or wealth lost through some misfortune, so that when they have children there is nothing left for them to inherit.
21005015 Everyone comes naked from their mother’s womb, and as everyone comes, so they depart. They take nothing from their toil that they can carry in their hands.
21005016 This too is a grievous evil: As everyone comes, so they depart, and what do they gain, since they toil for the wind?
21005017 All their days they eat in darkness, with great frustration, affliction and anger.
21005018 This is what I have observed to be good: that it is appropriate for a person to eat, to drink and to find satisfaction in their toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has given them—for this is their lot.
21005019 Moreover, when God gives someone wealth and possessions, and the ability to enjoy them, to accept their lot and be happy in their toil—this is a gift of God.
21005020 They seldom reflect on the days of their life, because God keeps them occupied with gladness of heart.
21006001 I have seen another evil under the sun, and it weighs heavily on mankind:
21006002 God gives some people wealth, possessions and honor, so that they lack nothing their hearts desire, but God does not grant them the ability to enjoy them, and strangers enjoy them instead. This is meaningless, a grievous evil.
21006003 A man may have a hundred children and live many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he cannot enjoy his prosperity and does not receive proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.
21006004 It comes without meaning, it departs in darkness, and in darkness its name is shrouded.
21006005 Though it never saw the sun or knew anything, it has more rest than does that man—
21006006 even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?
21006007 Everyone’s toil is for their mouth, yet their appetite is never satisfied.
21006008 What advantage have the wise over fools? What do the poor gain by knowing how to conduct themselves before others?
21006009 Better what the eye sees than the roving of the appetite. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
21006010 Whatever exists has already been named, and what humanity is has been known; no one can contend with someone who is stronger.
21006011 The more the words, the less the meaning, and how does that profit anyone?
21006012 For who knows what is good for a person in life, during the few and meaningless days they pass through like a shadow? Who can tell them what will happen under the sun after they are gone?
21007001 A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of death better than the day of birth.
21007002 It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, for death is the destiny of everyone; the living should take this to heart.
21007003 Frustration is better than laughter, because a sad face is good for the heart.
21007004 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.
21007005 It is better to heed the rebuke of a wise person than to listen to the song of fools.
21007006 Like the crackling of thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of fools. This too is meaningless.
21007007 Extortion turns a wise person into a fool, and a bribe corrupts the heart.
21007008 The end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride.
21007009 Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger resides in the lap of fools.
21007010 Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these?” For it is not wise to ask such questions.
21007011 Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing and benefits those who see the sun.
21007012 Wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter, but the advantage of knowledge is this: Wisdom preserves those who have it.
21007013 Consider what God has done: Who can straighten what he has made crooked?
21007014 When times are good, be happy; but when times are bad, consider this: God has made the one as well as the other. Therefore, no one can discover anything about their future.
21007015 In this meaningless life of mine I have seen both of these: the righteous perishing in their righteousness, and the wicked living long in their wickedness.
21007016 Do not be overrighteous, neither be overwise— why destroy yourself?
21007017 Do not be overwicked, and do not be a fool— why die before your time?
21007018 It is good to grasp the one and not let go of the other. Whoever fears God will avoid all extremes.
21007019 Wisdom makes one wise person more powerful than ten rulers in a city.
21007020 Indeed, there is no one on earth who is righteous, no one who does what is right and never sins.
21007021 Do not pay attention to every word people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you—
21007022 for you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others.
21007023 All this I tested by wisdom and I said, “I am determined to be wise”— but this was beyond me.
21007024 Whatever exists is far off and most profound— who can discover it?
21007025 So I turned my mind to understand, to investigate and to search out wisdom and the scheme of things and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the madness of folly.
21007026 I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a trap and whose hands are chains. The man who pleases God will escape her, but the sinner she will ensnare.
21007027 “Look,” says the Teacher, “this is what I have discovered: “Adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things—
21007028 while I was still searching but not finding— I found one upright man among a thousand, but not one upright woman among them all.
21007029 This only have I found: God created mankind upright, but they have gone in search of many schemes.”
21008001 Who is like the wise? Who knows the explanation of things? A person’s wisdom brightens their face and changes its hard appearance.
21008002 Obey the king’s command, I say, because you took an oath before God.
21008003 Do not be in a hurry to leave the king’s presence. Do not stand up for a bad cause, for he will do whatever he pleases.
21008004 Since a king’s word is supreme, who can say to him, “What are you doing?”
21008005 Whoever obeys his command will come to no harm, and the wise heart will know the proper time and procedure.
21008006 For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter, though a person may be weighed down by misery.
21008007 Since no one knows the future, who can tell someone else what is to come?
21008008 As no one has power over the wind to contain it, so no one has power over the time of their death. As no one is discharged in time of war, so wickedness will not release those who practice it.
21008009 All this I saw, as I applied my mind to everything done under the sun. There is a time when a man lords it over others to his own hurt.
21008010 Then too, I saw the wicked buried—those who used to come and go from the holy place and receive praise in the city where they did this. This too is meaningless.
21008011 When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out, people’s hearts are filled with schemes to do wrong.
21008012 Although a wicked person who commits a hundred crimes may live a long time, I know that it will go better with those who fear God, who are reverent before him.
21008013 Yet because the wicked do not fear God, it will not go well with them, and their days will not lengthen like a shadow.
21008014 There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth: the righteous who get what the wicked deserve, and the wicked who get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless.
21008015 So I commend the enjoyment of life, because there is nothing better for a person under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad. Then joy will accompany them in their toil all the days of the life God has given them under the sun.
21008016 When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe the labor that is done on earth—people getting no sleep day or night—
21008017 then I saw all that God has done. No one can comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all their efforts to search it out, no one can discover its meaning. Even if the wise claim they know, they cannot really comprehend it.
21009001 So I reflected on all this and concluded that the righteous and the wise and what they do are in God’s hands, but no one knows whether love or hate awaits them.
21009002 All share a common destiny—the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who do not. As it is with the good, so with the sinful; as it is with those who take oaths, so with those who are afraid to take them.
21009003 This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun: The same destiny overtakes all. The hearts of people, moreover, are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterward they join the dead.
21009004 Anyone who is among the living has hope —even a live dog is better off than a dead lion!
21009005 For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward, and even their name is forgotten.
21009006 Their love, their hate and their jealousy have long since vanished; never again will they have a part in anything that happens under the sun.
21009007 Go, eat your food with gladness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for God has already approved what you do.
21009008 Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your head with oil.
21009009 Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun—all your meaningless days. For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun.
21009010 Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the realm of the dead, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.
21009011 I have seen something else under the sun: The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all.
21009012 Moreover, no one knows when their hour will come: As fish are caught in a cruel net, or birds are taken in a snare, so people are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly upon them.
21009013 I also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that greatly impressed me:
21009014 There was once a small city with only a few people in it. And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge siege works against it.
21009015 Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man.
21009016 So I said, “Wisdom is better than strength.” But the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are no longer heeded.
21009017 The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools.
21009018 Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.
21010001 As dead flies give perfume a bad smell, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.
21010002 The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of the fool to the left.
21010003 Even as fools walk along the road, they lack sense and show everyone how stupid they are.
21010004 If a ruler’s anger rises against you, do not leave your post; calmness can lay great offenses to rest.
21010005 There is an evil I have seen under the sun, the sort of error that arises from a ruler:
21010006 Fools are put in many high positions, while the rich occupy the low ones.
21010007 I have seen slaves on horseback, while princes go on foot like slaves.
21010008 Whoever digs a pit may fall into it; whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.
21010009 Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them; whoever splits logs may be endangered by them.
21010010 If the ax is dull and its edge unsharpened, more strength is needed, but skill will bring success.
21010011 If a snake bites before it is charmed, the charmer receives no fee.
21010012 Words from the mouth of the wise are gracious, but fools are consumed by their own lips.
21010013 At the beginning their words are folly; at the end they are wicked madness—
21010014 and fools multiply words. No one knows what is coming— who can tell someone else what will happen after them?
21010015 The toil of fools wearies them; they do not know the way to town.
21010016 Woe to the land whose king was a servant and whose princes feast in the morning.
21010017 Blessed is the land whose king is of noble birth and whose princes eat at a proper time— for strength and not for drunkenness.
21010018 Through laziness, the rafters sag; because of idle hands, the house leaks.
21010019 A feast is made for laughter, wine makes life merry, and money is the answer for everything.
21010020 Do not revile the king even in your thoughts, or curse the rich in your bedroom, because a bird in the sky may carry your words, and a bird on the wing may report what you say.
21011001 Ship your grain across the sea; after many days you may receive a return.
21011002 Invest in seven ventures, yes, in eight; you do not know what disaster may come upon the land.
21011003 If clouds are full of water, they pour rain on the earth. Whether a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where it falls, there it will lie.
21011004 Whoever watches the wind will not plant; whoever looks at the clouds will not reap.
21011005 As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body is formed in a mother’s womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the Maker of all things.
21011006 Sow your seed in the morning, and at evening let your hands not be idle, for you do not know which will succeed, whether this or that, or whether both will do equally well.
21011007 Light is sweet, and it pleases the eyes to see the sun.
21011008 However many years anyone may live, let them enjoy them all. But let them remember the days of darkness, for there will be many. Everything to come is meaningless.
21011009 You who are young, be happy while you are young, and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth. Follow the ways of your heart and whatever your eyes see, but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.
21011010 So then, banish anxiety from your heart and cast off the troubles of your body, for youth and vigor are meaningless.
21012001 Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the days of trouble come and the years approach when you will say, “I find no pleasure in them”—
21012002 before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars grow dark, and the clouds return after the rain;
21012003 when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men stoop, when the grinders cease because they are few, and those looking through the windows grow dim;
21012004 when the doors to the street are closed and the sound of grinding fades; when people rise up at the sound of birds, but all their songs grow faint;
21012005 when people are afraid of heights and of dangers in the streets; when the almond tree blossoms and the grasshopper drags itself along and desire no longer is stirred. Then people go to their eternal home and mourners go about the streets.
21012006 Remember him—before the silver cord is severed, and the golden bowl is broken; before the pitcher is shattered at the spring, and the wheel broken at the well,
21012007 and the dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.
21012008 “Meaningless! Meaningless!” says the Teacher. “Everything is meaningless!”
21012009 Not only was the Teacher wise, but he also imparted knowledge to the people. He pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs.
21012010 The Teacher searched to find just the right words, and what he wrote was upright and true.
21012011 The words of the wise are like goads, their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails—given by one shepherd.
21012012 Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them. Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body.
21012013 Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind.
21012014 For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.
22001001 Solomon’s Song of Songs.
22001002 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth— for your love is more delightful than wine.
22001003 Pleasing is the fragrance of your perfumes; your name is like perfume poured out. No wonder the young women love you!
22001004 Take me away with you—let us hurry! Let the king bring me into his chambers. We rejoice and delight in you ; we will praise your love more than wine. How right they are to adore you!
22001005 Dark am I, yet lovely, daughters of Jerusalem, dark like the tents of Kedar, like the tent curtains of Solomon.
22001006 Do not stare at me because I am dark, because I am darkened by the sun. My mother’s sons were angry with me and made me take care of the vineyards; my own vineyard I had to neglect.
22001007 Tell me, you whom I love, where you graze your flock and where you rest your sheep at midday. Why should I be like a veiled woman beside the flocks of your friends?
22001008 If you do not know, most beautiful of women, follow the tracks of the sheep and graze your young goats by the tents of the shepherds.
22001009 I liken you, my darling, to a mare among Pharaoh’s chariot horses.
22001010 Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings, your neck with strings of jewels.
22001011 We will make you earrings of gold, studded with silver.
22001012 While the king was at his table, my perfume spread its fragrance.
22001013 My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh resting between my breasts.
22001014 My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards of En Gedi.
22001015 How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how beautiful! Your eyes are doves.
22001016 How handsome you are, my beloved! Oh, how charming! And our bed is verdant.
22001017 The beams of our house are cedars; our rafters are firs.
22002001 I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.
22002002 Like a lily among thorns is my darling among the young women.
22002003 Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest is my beloved among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste.
22002004 Let him lead me to the banquet hall, and let his banner over me be love.
22002005 Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love.
22002006 His left arm is under my head, and his right arm embraces me.
22002007 Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and by the does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.
22002008 Listen! My beloved! Look! Here he comes, leaping across the mountains, bounding over the hills.
22002009 My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look! There he stands behind our wall, gazing through the windows, peering through the lattice.
22002010 My beloved spoke and said to me, “Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, come with me.
22002011 See! The winter is past; the rains are over and gone.
22002012 Flowers appear on the earth; the season of singing has come, the cooing of doves is heard in our land.
22002013 The fig tree forms its early fruit; the blossoming vines spread their fragrance. Arise, come, my darling; my beautiful one, come with me.”
22002014 My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hiding places on the mountainside, show me your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.
22002015 Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that ruin the vineyards, our vineyards that are in bloom.
22002016 My beloved is mine and I am his; he browses among the lilies.
22002017 Until the day breaks and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the rugged hills.
22003001 All night long on my bed I looked for the one my heart loves; I looked for him but did not find him.
22003002 I will get up now and go about the city, through its streets and squares; I will search for the one my heart loves. So I looked for him but did not find him.
22003003 The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. “Have you seen the one my heart loves?”
22003004 Scarcely had I passed them when I found the one my heart loves. I held him and would not let him go till I had brought him to my mother’s house, to the room of the one who conceived me.
22003005 Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and by the does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.
22003006 Who is this coming up from the wilderness like a column of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and incense made from all the spices of the merchant?
22003007 Look! It is Solomon’s carriage, escorted by sixty warriors, the noblest of Israel,
22003008 all of them wearing the sword, all experienced in battle, each with his sword at his side, prepared for the terrors of the night.
22003009 King Solomon made for himself the carriage; he made it of wood from Lebanon.
22003010 Its posts he made of silver, its base of gold. Its seat was upholstered with purple, its interior inlaid with love. Daughters of Jerusalem,
22003011 come out, and look, you daughters of Zion. Look on King Solomon wearing a crown, the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, the day his heart rejoiced.
22004001 How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how beautiful! Your eyes behind your veil are doves. Your hair is like a flock of goats descending from the hills of Gilead.
22004002 Your teeth are like a flock of sheep just shorn, coming up from the washing. Each has its twin; not one of them is alone.
22004003 Your lips are like a scarlet ribbon; your mouth is lovely. Your temples behind your veil are like the halves of a pomegranate.
22004004 Your neck is like the tower of David, built with courses of stone ; on it hang a thousand shields, all of them shields of warriors.
22004005 Your breasts are like two fawns, like twin fawns of a gazelle that browse among the lilies.
22004006 Until the day breaks and the shadows flee, I will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of incense.
22004007 You are altogether beautiful, my darling; there is no flaw in you.
22004008 Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, come with me from Lebanon. Descend from the crest of Amana, from the top of Senir, the summit of Hermon, from the lions’ dens and the mountain haunts of leopards.
22004009 You have stolen my heart, my sister, my bride; you have stolen my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.
22004010 How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride! How much more pleasing is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your perfume more than any spice!
22004011 Your lips drop sweetness as the honeycomb, my bride; milk and honey are under your tongue. The fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
22004012 You are a garden locked up, my sister, my bride; you are a spring enclosed, a sealed fountain.
22004013 Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates with choice fruits, with henna and nard,
22004014 nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with every kind of incense tree, with myrrh and aloes and all the finest spices.
22004015 You are a garden fountain, a well of flowing water streaming down from Lebanon.
22004016 Awake, north wind, and come, south wind! Blow on my garden, that its fragrance may spread everywhere. Let my beloved come into his garden and taste its choice fruits.
22005001 I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey; I have drunk my wine and my milk. Eat, friends, and drink; drink your fill of love.
22005002 I slept but my heart was awake. Listen! My beloved is knocking: “Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my flawless one. My head is drenched with dew, my hair with the dampness of the night.”
22005003 I have taken off my robe— must I put it on again? I have washed my feet— must I soil them again?
22005004 My beloved thrust his hand through the latch-opening; my heart began to pound for him.
22005005 I arose to open for my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh, on the handles of the bolt.
22005006 I opened for my beloved, but my beloved had left; he was gone. My heart sank at his departure. I looked for him but did not find him. I called him but he did not answer.
22005007 The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. They beat me, they bruised me; they took away my cloak, those watchmen of the walls!
22005008 Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you— if you find my beloved, what will you tell him? Tell him I am faint with love.
22005009 How is your beloved better than others, most beautiful of women? How is your beloved better than others, that you so charge us?
22005010 My beloved is radiant and ruddy, outstanding among ten thousand.
22005011 His head is purest gold; his hair is wavy and black as a raven.
22005012 His eyes are like doves by the water streams, washed in milk, mounted like jewels.
22005013 His cheeks are like beds of spice yielding perfume. His lips are like lilies dripping with myrrh.
22005014 His arms are rods of gold set with topaz. His body is like polished ivory decorated with lapis lazuli.
22005015 His legs are pillars of marble set on bases of pure gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as its cedars.
22005016 His mouth is sweetness itself; he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, this is my friend, daughters of Jerusalem.
22006001 Where has your beloved gone, most beautiful of women? Which way did your beloved turn, that we may look for him with you?
22006002 My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to browse in the gardens and to gather lilies.
22006003 I am my beloved’s and my beloved is mine; he browses among the lilies.
22006004 You are as beautiful as Tirzah, my darling, as lovely as Jerusalem, as majestic as troops with banners.
22006005 Turn your eyes from me; they overwhelm me. Your hair is like a flock of goats descending from Gilead.
22006006 Your teeth are like a flock of sheep coming up from the washing. Each has its twin, not one of them is missing.
22006007 Your temples behind your veil are like the halves of a pomegranate.
22006008 Sixty queens there may be, and eighty concubines, and virgins beyond number;
22006009 but my dove, my perfect one, is unique, the only daughter of her mother, the favorite of the one who bore her. The young women saw her and called her blessed; the queens and concubines praised her.
22006010 Who is this that appears like the dawn, fair as the moon, bright as the sun, majestic as the stars in procession?
22006011 I went down to the grove of nut trees to look at the new growth in the valley, to see if the vines had budded or the pomegranates were in bloom.
22006012 Before I realized it, my desire set me among the royal chariots of my people.
22006013 Come back, come back, O Shulammite; come back, come back, that we may gaze on you! Why would you gaze on the Shulammite as on the dance of Mahanaim?
22007001 How beautiful your sandaled feet, O prince’s daughter! Your graceful legs are like jewels, the work of an artist’s hands.
22007002 Your navel is a rounded goblet that never lacks blended wine. Your waist is a mound of wheat encircled by lilies.
22007003 Your breasts are like two fawns, like twin fawns of a gazelle.
22007004 Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath Rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon looking toward Damascus.
22007005 Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel. Your hair is like royal tapestry; the king is held captive by its tresses.
22007006 How beautiful you are and how pleasing, my love, with your delights!
22007007 Your stature is like that of the palm, and your breasts like clusters of fruit.
22007008 I said, “I will climb the palm tree; I will take hold of its fruit.” May your breasts be like clusters of grapes on the vine, the fragrance of your breath like apples,
22007009 and your mouth like the best wine. May the wine go straight to my beloved, flowing gently over lips and teeth.
22007010 I belong to my beloved, and his desire is for me.
22007011 Come, my beloved, let us go to the countryside, let us spend the night in the villages.
22007012 Let us go early to the vineyards to see if the vines have budded, if their blossoms have opened, and if the pomegranates are in bloom— there I will give you my love.
22007013 The mandrakes send out their fragrance, and at our door is every delicacy, both new and old, that I have stored up for you, my beloved.
22008001 If only you were to me like a brother, who was nursed at my mother’s breasts! Then, if I found you outside, I would kiss you, and no one would despise me.
22008002 I would lead you and bring you to my mother’s house— she who has taught me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the nectar of my pomegranates.
22008003 His left arm is under my head and his right arm embraces me.
22008004 Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.
22008005 Who is this coming up from the wilderness leaning on her beloved? Under the apple tree I roused you; there your mother conceived you, there she who was in labor gave you birth.
22008006 Place me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm; for love is as strong as death, its jealousy unyielding as the grave. It burns like blazing fire, like a mighty flame.
22008007 Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot sweep it away. If one were to give all the wealth of one’s house for love, it would be utterly scorned.
22008008 We have a little sister, and her breasts are not yet grown. What shall we do for our sister on the day she is spoken for?
22008009 If she is a wall, we will build towers of silver on her. If she is a door, we will enclose her with panels of cedar.
22008010 I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers. Thus I have become in his eyes like one bringing contentment.
22008011 Solomon had a vineyard in Baal Hamon; he let out his vineyard to tenants. Each was to bring for its fruit a thousand shekels of silver.
22008012 But my own vineyard is mine to give; the thousand shekels are for you, Solomon, and two hundred are for those who tend its fruit.
22008013 You who dwell in the gardens with friends in attendance, let me hear your voice!
22008014 Come away, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the spice-laden mountains.
23001001 The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
23001002 Hear me, you heavens! Listen, earth! For the Lord has spoken: “I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me.
23001003 The ox knows its master, the donkey its owner’s manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand.”
23001004 Woe to the sinful nation, a people whose guilt is great, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the Lord; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him.
23001005 Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted.
23001006 From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness— only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with olive oil.
23001007 Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers.
23001008 Daughter Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a cucumber field, like a city under siege.
23001009 Unless the Lord Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.
23001010 Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the instruction of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
23001011 “The multitude of your sacrifices— what are they to me?” says the Lord. “I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.
23001012 When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts?
23001013 Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations— I cannot bear your worthless assemblies.
23001014 Your New Moon feasts and your appointed festivals I hate with all my being. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.
23001015 When you spread out your hands in prayer, I hide my eyes from you; even when you offer many prayers, I am not listening. Your hands are full of blood!
23001016 Wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight; stop doing wrong.
23001017 Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow.
23001018 “Come now, let us settle the matter,” says the Lord. “Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.
23001019 If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the good things of the land;
23001020 but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword.” For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.
23001021 See how the faithful city has become a prostitute! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her— but now murderers!
23001022 Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water.
23001023 Your rulers are rebels, partners with thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow’s case does not come before them.
23001024 Therefore the Lord, the Lord Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: “Ah! I will vent my wrath on my foes and avenge myself on my enemies.
23001025 I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities.
23001026 I will restore your leaders as in days of old, your rulers as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.”
23001027 Zion will be delivered with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness.
23001028 But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the Lord will perish.
23001029 “You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen.
23001030 You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water.
23001031 The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire.”
23002001 This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
23002002 In the last days the mountain of the Lord’s temple will be established as the highest of the mountains; it will be exalted above the hills, and all nations will stream to it.
23002003 Many peoples will come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the temple of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths.” The law will go out from Zion, the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
23002004 He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.
23002005 Come, descendants of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the Lord.
23002006 You, Lord, have abandoned your people, the descendants of Jacob. They are full of superstitions from the East; they practice divination like the Philistines and embrace pagan customs.
23002007 Their land is full of silver and gold; there is no end to their treasures. Their land is full of horses; there is no end to their chariots.
23002008 Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their fingers have made.
23002009 So people will be brought low and everyone humbled— do not forgive them.
23002010 Go into the rocks, hide in the ground from the fearful presence of the Lord and the splendor of his majesty!
23002011 The eyes of the arrogant will be humbled and human pride brought low; the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.
23002012 The Lord Almighty has a day in store for all the proud and lofty, for all that is exalted (and they will be humbled),
23002013 for all the cedars of Lebanon, tall and lofty, and all the oaks of Bashan,
23002014 for all the towering mountains and all the high hills,
23002015 for every lofty tower and every fortified wall,
23002016 for every trading ship and every stately vessel.
23002017 The arrogance of man will be brought low and human pride humbled; the Lord alone will be exalted in that day,
23002018 and the idols will totally disappear.
23002019 People will flee to caves in the rocks and to holes in the ground from the fearful presence of the Lord and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.
23002020 In that day people will throw away to the moles and bats their idols of silver and idols of gold, which they made to worship.
23002021 They will flee to caverns in the rocks and to the overhanging crags from the fearful presence of the Lord and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.
23002022 Stop trusting in mere humans, who have but a breath in their nostrils. Why hold them in esteem?
23003001 See now, the Lord, the Lord Almighty, is about to take from Jerusalem and Judah both supply and support: all supplies of food and all supplies of water,
23003002 the hero and the warrior, the judge and the prophet, the diviner and the elder,
23003003 the captain of fifty and the man of rank, the counselor, skilled craftsman and clever enchanter.
23003004 “I will make mere youths their officials; children will rule over them.”
23003005 People will oppress each other— man against man, neighbor against neighbor. The young will rise up against the old, the nobody against the honored.
23003006 A man will seize one of his brothers in his father’s house, and say, “You have a cloak, you be our leader; take charge of this heap of ruins!”
23003007 But in that day he will cry out, “I have no remedy. I have no food or clothing in my house; do not make me the leader of the people.”
23003008 Jerusalem staggers, Judah is falling; their words and deeds are against the Lord, defying his glorious presence.
23003009 The look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves.
23003010 Tell the righteous it will be well with them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds.
23003011 Woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon them! They will be paid back for what their hands have done.
23003012 Youths oppress my people, women rule over them. My people, your guides lead you astray; they turn you from the path.
23003013 The Lord takes his place in court; he rises to judge the people.
23003014 The Lord enters into judgment against the elders and leaders of his people: “It is you who have ruined my vineyard; the plunder from the poor is in your houses.
23003015 What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the faces of the poor?” declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty.
23003016 The Lord says, “The women of Zion are haughty, walking along with outstretched necks, flirting with their eyes, strutting along with swaying hips, with ornaments jingling on their ankles.
23003017 Therefore the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of Zion; the Lord will make their scalps bald.”
23003018 In that day the Lord will snatch away their finery: the bangles and headbands and crescent necklaces,
23003019 the earrings and bracelets and veils,
23003020 the headdresses and anklets and sashes, the perfume bottles and charms,
23003021 the signet rings and nose rings,
23003022 the fine robes and the capes and cloaks, the purses
23003023 and mirrors, and the linen garments and tiaras and shawls.
23003024 Instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a sash, a rope; instead of well-dressed hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; instead of beauty, branding.
23003025 Your men will fall by the sword, your warriors in battle.
23003026 The gates of Zion will lament and mourn; destitute, she will sit on the ground.
23004001 In that day seven women will take hold of one man and say, “We will eat our own food and provide our own clothes; only let us be called by your name. Take away our disgrace!”
23004002 In that day the Branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of the survivors in Israel.
23004003 Those who are left in Zion, who remain in Jerusalem, will be called holy, all who are recorded among the living in Jerusalem.
23004004 The Lord will wash away the filth of the women of Zion; he will cleanse the bloodstains from Jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of fire.
23004005 Then the Lord will create over all of Mount Zion and over those who assemble there a cloud of smoke by day and a glow of flaming fire by night; over everything the glory will be a canopy.
23004006 It will be a shelter and shade from the heat of the day, and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and rain.
23005001 I will sing for the one I love a song about his vineyard: My loved one had a vineyard on a fertile hillside.
23005002 He dug it up and cleared it of stones and planted it with the choicest vines. He built a watchtower in it and cut out a winepress as well. Then he looked for a crop of good grapes, but it yielded only bad fruit.
23005003 “Now you dwellers in Jerusalem and people of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard.
23005004 What more could have been done for my vineyard than I have done for it? When I looked for good grapes, why did it yield only bad?
23005005 Now I will tell you what I am going to do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it will be destroyed; I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled.
23005006 I will make it a wasteland, neither pruned nor cultivated, and briers and thorns will grow there. I will command the clouds not to rain on it.”
23005007 The vineyard of the Lord Almighty is the nation of Israel, and the people of Judah are the vines he delighted in. And he looked for justice, but saw bloodshed; for righteousness, but heard cries of distress.
23005008 Woe to you who add house to house and join field to field till no space is left and you live alone in the land.
23005009 The Lord Almighty has declared in my hearing: “Surely the great houses will become desolate, the fine mansions left without occupants.
23005010 A ten-acre vineyard will produce only a bath of wine; a homer of seed will yield only an ephah of grain.”
23005011 Woe to those who rise early in the morning to run after their drinks, who stay up late at night till they are inflamed with wine.
23005012 They have harps and lyres at their banquets, pipes and timbrels and wine, but they have no regard for the deeds of the Lord, no respect for the work of his hands.
23005013 Therefore my people will go into exile for lack of understanding; those of high rank will die of hunger and the common people will be parched with thirst.
23005014 Therefore Death expands its jaws, opening wide its mouth; into it will descend their nobles and masses with all their brawlers and revelers.
23005015 So people will be brought low and everyone humbled, the eyes of the arrogant humbled.
23005016 But the Lord Almighty will be exalted by his justice, and the holy God will be proved holy by his righteous acts.
23005017 Then sheep will graze as in their own pasture; lambs will feed among the ruins of the rich.
23005018 Woe to those who draw sin along with cords of deceit, and wickedness as with cart ropes,
23005019 to those who say, “Let God hurry; let him hasten his work so we may see it. The plan of the Holy One of Israel— let it approach, let it come into view, so we may know it.”
23005020 Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.
23005021 Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight.
23005022 Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine and champions at mixing drinks,
23005023 who acquit the guilty for a bribe, but deny justice to the innocent.
23005024 Therefore, as tongues of fire lick up straw and as dry grass sinks down in the flames, so their roots will decay and their flowers blow away like dust; for they have rejected the law of the Lord Almighty and spurned the word of the Holy One of Israel.
23005025 Therefore the Lord’s anger burns against his people; his hand is raised and he strikes them down. The mountains shake, and the dead bodies are like refuse in the streets. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.
23005026 He lifts up a banner for the distant nations, he whistles for those at the ends of the earth. Here they come, swiftly and speedily!
23005027 Not one of them grows tired or stumbles, not one slumbers or sleeps; not a belt is loosened at the waist, not a sandal strap is broken.
23005028 Their arrows are sharp, all their bows are strung; their horses’ hooves seem like flint, their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.
23005029 Their roar is like that of the lion, they roar like young lions; they growl as they seize their prey and carry it off with no one to rescue.
23005030 In that day they will roar over it like the roaring of the sea. And if one looks at the land, there is only darkness and distress; even the sun will be darkened by clouds.
23006001 In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord, high and exalted, seated on a throne; and the train of his robe filled the temple.
23006002 Above him were seraphim, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.
23006003 And they were calling to one another: “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory.”
23006004 At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke.
23006005 “Woe to me!” I cried. “I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the Lord Almighty.”
23006006 Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar.
23006007 With it he touched my mouth and said, “See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for.”
23006008 Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?” And I said, “Here am I. Send me!”
23006009 He said, “Go and tell this people: “ ‘Be ever hearing, but never understanding; be ever seeing, but never perceiving.’
23006010 Make the heart of this people calloused; make their ears dull and close their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.”
23006011 Then I said, “For how long, Lord?” And he answered: “Until the cities lie ruined and without inhabitant, until the houses are left deserted and the fields ruined and ravaged,
23006012 until the Lord has sent everyone far away and the land is utterly forsaken.
23006013 And though a tenth remains in the land, it will again be laid waste. But as the terebinth and oak leave stumps when they are cut down, so the holy seed will be the stump in the land.”
23007001 When Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, King Rezin of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel marched up to fight against Jerusalem, but they could not overpower it.
23007002 Now the house of David was told, “Aram has allied itself with Ephraim”; so the hearts of Ahaz and his people were shaken, as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind.
23007003 Then the Lord said to Isaiah, “Go out, you and your son Shear-Jashub, to meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field.
23007004 Say to him, ‘Be careful, keep calm and don’t be afraid. Do not lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood—because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah.
23007005 Aram, Ephraim and Remaliah’s son have plotted your ruin, saying,
23007006 “Let us invade Judah; let us tear it apart and divide it among ourselves, and make the son of Tabeel king over it.”
23007007 Yet this is what the Sovereign Lord says: “ ‘It will not take place, it will not happen,
23007008 for the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is only Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people.
23007009 The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is only Remaliah’s son. If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all.’ ”
23007010 Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz,
23007011 “Ask the Lord your God for a sign, whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights.”
23007012 But Ahaz said, “I will not ask; I will not put the Lord to the test.”
23007013 Then Isaiah said, “Hear now, you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of humans? Will you try the patience of my God also?
23007014 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.
23007015 He will be eating curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right,
23007016 for before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste.
23007017 The Lord will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since Ephraim broke away from Judah—he will bring the king of Assyria.”
23007018 In that day the Lord will whistle for flies from the Nile delta in Egypt and for bees from the land of Assyria.
23007019 They will all come and settle in the steep ravines and in the crevices in the rocks, on all the thornbushes and at all the water holes.
23007020 In that day the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria—to shave your heads and private parts, and to cut off your beards also.
23007021 In that day, a person will keep alive a young cow and two goats.
23007022 And because of the abundance of the milk they give, there will be curds to eat. All who remain in the land will eat curds and honey.
23007023 In that day, in every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels, there will be only briers and thorns.
23007024 Hunters will go there with bow and arrow, for the land will be covered with briers and thorns.
23007025 As for all the hills once cultivated by the hoe, you will no longer go there for fear of the briers and thorns; they will become places where cattle are turned loose and where sheep run.
23008001 The Lord said to me, “Take a large scroll and write on it with an ordinary pen: Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.”
23008002 So I called in Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah as reliable witnesses for me.
23008003 Then I made love to the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. And the Lord said to me, “Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.
23008004 For before the boy knows how to say ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria.”
23008005 The Lord spoke to me again:
23008006 “Because this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoices over Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
23008007 therefore the Lord is about to bring against them the mighty floodwaters of the Euphrates— the king of Assyria with all his pomp. It will overflow all its channels, run over all its banks
23008008 and sweep on into Judah, swirling over it, passing through it and reaching up to the neck. Its outspread wings will cover the breadth of your land, Immanuel !”
23008009 Raise the war cry, you nations, and be shattered! Listen, all you distant lands. Prepare for battle, and be shattered! Prepare for battle, and be shattered!
23008010 Devise your strategy, but it will be thwarted; propose your plan, but it will not stand, for God is with us.
23008011 This is what the Lord says to me with his strong hand upon me, warning me not to follow the way of this people:
23008012 “Do not call conspiracy everything this people calls a conspiracy; do not fear what they fear, and do not dread it.
23008013 The Lord Almighty is the one you are to regard as holy, he is the one you are to fear, he is the one you are to dread.
23008014 He will be a holy place; for both Israel and Judah he will be a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall. And for the people of Jerusalem he will be a trap and a snare.
23008015 Many of them will stumble; they will fall and be broken, they will be snared and captured.”
23008016 Bind up this testimony of warning and seal up God’s instruction among my disciples.
23008017 I will wait for the Lord, who is hiding his face from the descendants of Jacob. I will put my trust in him.
23008018 Here am I, and the children the Lord has given me. We are signs and symbols in Israel from the Lord Almighty, who dwells on Mount Zion.
23008019 When someone tells you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?
23008020 Consult God’s instruction and the testimony of warning. If anyone does not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn.
23008021 Distressed and hungry, they will roam through the land; when they are famished, they will become enraged and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God.
23008022 Then they will look toward the earth and see only distress and darkness and fearful gloom, and they will be thrust into utter darkness.
23009001 Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom for those who were in distress. In the past he humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future he will honor Galilee of the nations, by the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan—
23009002 The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of deep darkness a light has dawned.
23009003 You have enlarged the nation and increased their joy; they rejoice before you as people rejoice at the harvest, as warriors rejoice when dividing the plunder.
23009004 For as in the day of Midian’s defeat, you have shattered the yoke that burdens them, the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor.
23009005 Every warrior’s boot used in battle and every garment rolled in blood will be destined for burning, will be fuel for the fire.
23009006 For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
23009007 Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David’s throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever. The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this.
23009008 The Lord has sent a message against Jacob; it will fall on Israel.
23009009 All the people will know it— Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria— who say with pride and arrogance of heart,
23009010 “The bricks have fallen down, but we will rebuild with dressed stone; the fig trees have been felled, but we will replace them with cedars.”
23009011 But the Lord has strengthened Rezin’s foes against them and has spurred their enemies on.
23009012 Arameans from the east and Philistines from the west have devoured Israel with open mouth. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.
23009013 But the people have not returned to him who struck them, nor have they sought the Lord Almighty.
23009014 So the Lord will cut off from Israel both head and tail, both palm branch and reed in a single day;
23009015 the elders and dignitaries are the head, the prophets who teach lies are the tail.
23009016 Those who guide this people mislead them, and those who are guided are led astray.
23009017 Therefore the Lord will take no pleasure in the young men, nor will he pity the fatherless and widows, for everyone is ungodly and wicked, every mouth speaks folly. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.
23009018 Surely wickedness burns like a fire; it consumes briers and thorns, it sets the forest thickets ablaze, so that it rolls upward in a column of smoke.
23009019 By the wrath of the Lord Almighty the land will be scorched and the people will be fuel for the fire; they will not spare one another.
23009020 On the right they will devour, but still be hungry; on the left they will eat, but not be satisfied. Each will feed on the flesh of their own offspring :
23009021 Manasseh will feed on Ephraim, and Ephraim on Manasseh; together they will turn against Judah. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.
23010001 Woe to those who make unjust laws, to those who issue oppressive decrees,
23010002 to deprive the poor of their rights and withhold justice from the oppressed of my people, making widows their prey and robbing the fatherless.
23010003 What will you do on the day of reckoning, when disaster comes from afar? To whom will you run for help? Where will you leave your riches?
23010004 Nothing will remain but to cringe among the captives or fall among the slain. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.
23010005 “Woe to the Assyrian, the rod of my anger, in whose hand is the club of my wrath!
23010006 I send him against a godless nation, I dispatch him against a people who anger me, to seize loot and snatch plunder, and to trample them down like mud in the streets.
23010007 But this is not what he intends, this is not what he has in mind; his purpose is to destroy, to put an end to many nations.
23010008 ‘Are not my commanders all kings?’ he says.
23010009 ‘Has not Kalno fared like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad, and Samaria like Damascus?
23010010 As my hand seized the kingdoms of the idols, kingdoms whose images excelled those of Jerusalem and Samaria—
23010011 shall I not deal with Jerusalem and her images as I dealt with Samaria and her idols?’ ”
23010012 When the Lord has finished all his work against Mount Zion and Jerusalem, he will say, “I will punish the king of Assyria for the willful pride of his heart and the haughty look in his eyes.
23010013 For he says: “ ‘By the strength of my hand I have done this, and by my wisdom, because I have understanding. I removed the boundaries of nations, I plundered their treasures; like a mighty one I subdued their kings.
23010014 As one reaches into a nest, so my hand reached for the wealth of the nations; as people gather abandoned eggs, so I gathered all the countries; not one flapped a wing, or opened its mouth to chirp.’ ”
23010015 Does the ax raise itself above the person who swings it, or the saw boast against the one who uses it? As if a rod were to wield the person who lifts it up, or a club brandish the one who is not wood!
23010016 Therefore, the Lord, the Lord Almighty, will send a wasting disease upon his sturdy warriors; under his pomp a fire will be kindled like a blazing flame.
23010017 The Light of Israel will become a fire, their Holy One a flame; in a single day it will burn and consume his thorns and his briers.
23010018 The splendor of his forests and fertile fields it will completely destroy, as when a sick person wastes away.
23010019 And the remaining trees of his forests will be so few that a child could write them down.
23010020 In that day the remnant of Israel, the survivors of Jacob, will no longer rely on him who struck them down but will truly rely on the Lord, the Holy One of Israel.
23010021 A remnant will return, a remnant of Jacob will return to the Mighty God.
23010022 Though your people be like the sand by the sea, Israel, only a remnant will return. Destruction has been decreed, overwhelming and righteous.
23010023 The Lord, the Lord Almighty, will carry out the destruction decreed upon the whole land.
23010024 Therefore this is what the Lord, the Lord Almighty, says: “My people who live in Zion, do not be afraid of the Assyrians, who beat you with a rod and lift up a club against you, as Egypt did.
23010025 Very soon my anger against you will end and my wrath will be directed to their destruction.”
23010026 The Lord Almighty will lash them with a whip, as when he struck down Midian at the rock of Oreb; and he will raise his staff over the waters, as he did in Egypt.
23010027 In that day their burden will be lifted from your shoulders, their yoke from your neck; the yoke will be broken because you have grown so fat.
23010028 They enter Aiath; they pass through Migron; they store supplies at Mikmash.
23010029 They go over the pass, and say, “We will camp overnight at Geba.” Ramah trembles; Gibeah of Saul flees.
23010030 Cry out, Daughter Gallim! Listen, Laishah! Poor Anathoth!
23010031 Madmenah is in flight; the people of Gebim take cover.
23010032 This day they will halt at Nob; they will shake their fist at the mount of Daughter Zion, at the hill of Jerusalem.
23010033 See, the Lord, the Lord Almighty, will lop off the boughs with great power. The lofty trees will be felled, the tall ones will be brought low.
23010034 He will cut down the forest thickets with an ax; Lebanon will fall before the Mighty One.
23011001 A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse; from his roots a Branch will bear fruit.
23011002 The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him— the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of might, the Spirit of the knowledge and fear of the Lord—
23011003 and he will delight in the fear of the Lord. He will not judge by what he sees with his eyes, or decide by what he hears with his ears;
23011004 but with righteousness he will judge the needy, with justice he will give decisions for the poor of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked.
23011005 Righteousness will be his belt and faithfulness the sash around his waist.
23011006 The wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together; and a little child will lead them.
23011007 The cow will feed with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox.
23011008 The infant will play near the cobra’s den, and the young child will put its hand into the viper’s nest.
23011009 They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.
23011010 In that day the Root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples; the nations will rally to him, and his resting place will be glorious.
23011011 In that day the Lord will reach out his hand a second time to reclaim the surviving remnant of his people from Assyria, from Lower Egypt, from Upper Egypt, from Cush, from Elam, from Babylonia, from Hamath and from the islands of the Mediterranean.
23011012 He will raise a banner for the nations and gather the exiles of Israel; he will assemble the scattered people of Judah from the four quarters of the earth.
23011013 Ephraim’s jealousy will vanish, and Judah’s enemies will be destroyed; Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah, nor Judah hostile toward Ephraim.
23011014 They will swoop down on the slopes of Philistia to the west; together they will plunder the people to the east. They will subdue Edom and Moab, and the Ammonites will be subject to them.
23011015 The Lord will dry up the gulf of the Egyptian sea; with a scorching wind he will sweep his hand over the Euphrates River. He will break it up into seven streams so that anyone can cross over in sandals.
23011016 There will be a highway for the remnant of his people that is left from Assyria, as there was for Israel when they came up from Egypt.
23012001 In that day you will say: “I will praise you, Lord. Although you were angry with me, your anger has turned away and you have comforted me.
23012002 Surely God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid. The Lord, the Lord himself, is my strength and my defense ; he has become my salvation.”
23012003 With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation.
23012004 In that day you will say: “Give praise to the Lord, proclaim his name; make known among the nations what he has done, and proclaim that his name is exalted.
23012005 Sing to the Lord, for he has done glorious things; let this be known to all the world.
23012006 Shout aloud and sing for joy, people of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel among you.”
23013001 A prophecy against Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw:
23013002 Raise a banner on a bare hilltop, shout to them; beckon to them to enter the gates of the nobles.
23013003 I have commanded those I prepared for battle; I have summoned my warriors to carry out my wrath— those who rejoice in my triumph.
23013004 Listen, a noise on the mountains, like that of a great multitude! Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms, like nations massing together! The Lord Almighty is mustering an army for war.
23013005 They come from faraway lands, from the ends of the heavens— the Lord and the weapons of his wrath— to destroy the whole country.
23013006 Wail, for the day of the Lord is near; it will come like destruction from the Almighty.
23013007 Because of this, all hands will go limp, every heart will melt with fear.
23013008 Terror will seize them, pain and anguish will grip them; they will writhe like a woman in labor. They will look aghast at each other, their faces aflame.
23013009 See, the day of the Lord is coming —a cruel day, with wrath and fierce anger— to make the land desolate and destroy the sinners within it.
23013010 The stars of heaven and their constellations will not show their light. The rising sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light.
23013011 I will punish the world for its evil, the wicked for their sins. I will put an end to the arrogance of the haughty and will humble the pride of the ruthless.
23013012 I will make people scarcer than pure gold, more rare than the gold of Ophir.
23013013 Therefore I will make the heavens tremble; and the earth will shake from its place at the wrath of the Lord Almighty, in the day of his burning anger.
23013014 Like a hunted gazelle, like sheep without a shepherd, they will all return to their own people, they will flee to their native land.
23013015 Whoever is captured will be thrust through; all who are caught will fall by the sword.
23013016 Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be looted and their wives violated.
23013017 See, I will stir up against them the Medes, who do not care for silver and have no delight in gold.
23013018 Their bows will strike down the young men; they will have no mercy on infants, nor will they look with compassion on children.
23013019 Babylon, the jewel of kingdoms, the pride and glory of the Babylonians, will be overthrown by God like Sodom and Gomorrah.
23013020 She will never be inhabited or lived in through all generations; there no nomads will pitch their tents, there no shepherds will rest their flocks.
23013021 But desert creatures will lie there, jackals will fill her houses; there the owls will dwell, and there the wild goats will leap about.
23013022 Hyenas will inhabit her strongholds, jackals her luxurious palaces. Her time is at hand, and her days will not be prolonged.
23014001 The Lord will have compassion on Jacob; once again he will choose Israel and will settle them in their own land. Foreigners will join them and unite with the descendants of Jacob.
23014002 Nations will take them and bring them to their own place. And Israel will take possession of the nations and make them male and female servants in the Lord’s land. They will make captives of their captors and rule over their oppressors.
23014003 On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labor forced on you,
23014004 you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!
23014005 The Lord has broken the rod of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers,
23014006 which in anger struck down peoples with unceasing blows, and in fury subdued nations with relentless aggression.
23014007 All the lands are at rest and at peace; they break into singing.
23014008 Even the junipers and the cedars of Lebanon gloat over you and say, “Now that you have been laid low, no one comes to cut us down.”
23014009 The realm of the dead below is all astir to meet you at your coming; it rouses the spirits of the departed to greet you— all those who were leaders in the world; it makes them rise from their thrones— all those who were kings over the nations.
23014010 They will all respond, they will say to you, “You also have become weak, as we are; you have become like us.”
23014011 All your pomp has been brought down to the grave, along with the noise of your harps; maggots are spread out beneath you and worms cover you.
23014012 How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations!
23014013 You said in your heart, “I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of Mount Zaphon.
23014014 I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.”
23014015 But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit.
23014016 Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: “Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble,
23014017 the man who made the world a wilderness, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?”
23014018 All the kings of the nations lie in state, each in his own tomb.
23014019 But you are cast out of your tomb like a rejected branch; you are covered with the slain, with those pierced by the sword, those who descend to the stones of the pit. Like a corpse trampled underfoot,
23014020 you will not join them in burial, for you have destroyed your land and killed your people. Let the offspring of the wicked never be mentioned again.
23014021 Prepare a place to slaughter his children for the sins of their ancestors; they are not to rise to inherit the land and cover the earth with their cities.
23014022 “I will rise up against them,” declares the Lord Almighty. “I will wipe out Babylon’s name and survivors, her offspring and descendants,” declares the Lord.
23014023 “I will turn her into a place for owls and into swampland; I will sweep her with the broom of destruction,” declares the Lord Almighty.
23014024 The Lord Almighty has sworn, “Surely, as I have planned, so it will be, and as I have purposed, so it will happen.
23014025 I will crush the Assyrian in my land; on my mountains I will trample him down. His yoke will be taken from my people, and his burden removed from their shoulders.”
23014026 This is the plan determined for the whole world; this is the hand stretched out over all nations.
23014027 For the Lord Almighty has purposed, and who can thwart him? His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?
23014028 This prophecy came in the year King Ahaz died:
23014029 Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, that the rod that struck you is broken; from the root of that snake will spring up a viper, its fruit will be a darting, venomous serpent.
23014030 The poorest of the poor will find pasture, and the needy will lie down in safety. But your root I will destroy by famine; it will slay your survivors.
23014031 Wail, you gate! Howl, you city! Melt away, all you Philistines! A cloud of smoke comes from the north, and there is not a straggler in its ranks.
23014032 What answer shall be given to the envoys of that nation? “The Lord has established Zion, and in her his afflicted people will find refuge.”
23015001 A prophecy against Moab: Ar in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night! Kir in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night!
23015002 Dibon goes up to its temple, to its high places to weep; Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba. Every head is shaved and every beard cut off.
23015003 In the streets they wear sackcloth; on the roofs and in the public squares they all wail, prostrate with weeping.
23015004 Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, their voices are heard all the way to Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry out, and their hearts are faint.
23015005 My heart cries out over Moab; her fugitives flee as far as Zoar, as far as Eglath Shelishiyah. They go up the hill to Luhith, weeping as they go; on the road to Horonaim they lament their destruction.
23015006 The waters of Nimrim are dried up and the grass is withered; the vegetation is gone and nothing green is left.
23015007 So the wealth they have acquired and stored up they carry away over the Ravine of the Poplars.
23015008 Their outcry echoes along the border of Moab; their wailing reaches as far as Eglaim, their lamentation as far as Beer Elim.
23015009 The waters of Dimon are full of blood, but I will bring still more upon Dimon — a lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon those who remain in the land.
23016001 Send lambs as tribute to the ruler of the land, from Sela, across the desert, to the mount of Daughter Zion.
23016002 Like fluttering birds pushed from the nest, so are the women of Moab at the fords of the Arnon.
23016003 “Make up your mind,” Moab says. “Render a decision. Make your shadow like night— at high noon. Hide the fugitives, do not betray the refugees.
23016004 Let the Moabite fugitives stay with you; be their shelter from the destroyer.” The oppressor will come to an end, and destruction will cease; the aggressor will vanish from the land.
23016005 In love a throne will be established; in faithfulness a man will sit on it— one from the house of David— one who in judging seeks justice and speeds the cause of righteousness.
23016006 We have heard of Moab’s pride— how great is her arrogance!— of her conceit, her pride and her insolence; but her boasts are empty.
23016007 Therefore the Moabites wail, they wail together for Moab. Lament and grieve for the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth.
23016008 The fields of Heshbon wither, the vines of Sibmah also. The rulers of the nations have trampled down the choicest vines, which once reached Jazer and spread toward the desert. Their shoots spread out and went as far as the sea.
23016009 So I weep, as Jazer weeps, for the vines of Sibmah. Heshbon and Elealeh, I drench you with tears! The shouts of joy over your ripened fruit and over your harvests have been stilled.
23016010 Joy and gladness are taken away from the orchards; no one sings or shouts in the vineyards; no one treads out wine at the presses, for I have put an end to the shouting.
23016011 My heart laments for Moab like a harp, my inmost being for Kir Hareseth.
23016012 When Moab appears at her high place, she only wears herself out; when she goes to her shrine to pray, it is to no avail.
23016013 This is the word the Lord has already spoken concerning Moab.
23016014 But now the Lord says: “Within three years, as a servant bound by contract would count them, Moab’s splendor and all her many people will be despised, and her survivors will be very few and feeble.”
23017001 A prophecy against Damascus: “See, Damascus will no longer be a city but will become a heap of ruins.
23017002 The cities of Aroer will be deserted and left to flocks, which will lie down, with no one to make them afraid.
23017003 The fortified city will disappear from Ephraim, and royal power from Damascus; the remnant of Aram will be like the glory of the Israelites,” declares the Lord Almighty.
23017004 “In that day the glory of Jacob will fade; the fat of his body will waste away.
23017005 It will be as when reapers harvest the standing grain, gathering the grain in their arms— as when someone gleans heads of grain in the Valley of Rephaim.
23017006 Yet some gleanings will remain, as when an olive tree is beaten, leaving two or three olives on the topmost branches, four or five on the fruitful boughs,” declares the Lord, the God of Israel.
23017007 In that day people will look to their Maker and turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel.
23017008 They will not look to the altars, the work of their hands, and they will have no regard for the Asherah poles and the incense altars their fingers have made.
23017009 In that day their strong cities, which they left because of the Israelites, will be like places abandoned to thickets and undergrowth. And all will be desolation.
23017010 You have forgotten God your Savior; you have not remembered the Rock, your fortress. Therefore, though you set out the finest plants and plant imported vines,
23017011 though on the day you set them out, you make them grow, and on the morning when you plant them, you bring them to bud, yet the harvest will be as nothing in the day of disease and incurable pain.
23017012 Woe to the many nations that rage— they rage like the raging sea! Woe to the peoples who roar— they roar like the roaring of great waters!
23017013 Although the peoples roar like the roar of surging waters, when he rebukes them they flee far away, driven before the wind like chaff on the hills, like tumbleweed before a gale.
23017014 In the evening, sudden terror! Before the morning, they are gone! This is the portion of those who loot us, the lot of those who plunder us.
23018001 Woe to the land of whirring wings along the rivers of Cush,
23018002 which sends envoys by sea in papyrus boats over the water. Go, swift messengers, to a people tall and smooth-skinned, to a people feared far and wide, an aggressive nation of strange speech, whose land is divided by rivers.
23018003 All you people of the world, you who live on the earth, when a banner is raised on the mountains, you will see it, and when a trumpet sounds, you will hear it.
23018004 This is what the Lord says to me: “I will remain quiet and will look on from my dwelling place, like shimmering heat in the sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.”
23018005 For, before the harvest, when the blossom is gone and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off the shoots with pruning knives, and cut down and take away the spreading branches.
23018006 They will all be left to the mountain birds of prey and to the wild animals; the birds will feed on them all summer, the wild animals all winter.
23018007 At that time gifts will be brought to the Lord Almighty from a people tall and smooth-skinned, from a people feared far and wide, an aggressive nation of strange speech, whose land is divided by rivers— the gifts will be brought to Mount Zion, the place of the Name of the Lord Almighty.
23019001 A prophecy against Egypt: See, the Lord rides on a swift cloud and is coming to Egypt. The idols of Egypt tremble before him, and the hearts of the Egyptians melt with fear.
23019002 “I will stir up Egyptian against Egyptian— brother will fight against brother, neighbor against neighbor, city against city, kingdom against kingdom.
23019003 The Egyptians will lose heart, and I will bring their plans to nothing; they will consult the idols and the spirits of the dead, the mediums and the spiritists.
23019004 I will hand the Egyptians over to the power of a cruel master, and a fierce king will rule over them,” declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty.
23019005 The waters of the river will dry up, and the riverbed will be parched and dry.
23019006 The canals will stink; the streams of Egypt will dwindle and dry up. The reeds and rushes will wither,
23019007 also the plants along the Nile, at the mouth of the river. Every sown field along the Nile will become parched, will blow away and be no more.
23019008 The fishermen will groan and lament, all who cast hooks into the Nile; those who throw nets on the water will pine away.
23019009 Those who work with combed flax will despair, the weavers of fine linen will lose hope.
23019010 The workers in cloth will be dejected, and all the wage earners will be sick at heart.
23019011 The officials of Zoan are nothing but fools; the wise counselors of Pharaoh give senseless advice. How can you say to Pharaoh, “I am one of the wise men, a disciple of the ancient kings”?
23019012 Where are your wise men now? Let them show you and make known what the Lord Almighty has planned against Egypt.
23019013 The officials of Zoan have become fools, the leaders of Memphis are deceived; the cornerstones of her peoples have led Egypt astray.
23019014 The Lord has poured into them a spirit of dizziness; they make Egypt stagger in all that she does, as a drunkard staggers around in his vomit.
23019015 There is nothing Egypt can do— head or tail, palm branch or reed.
23019016 In that day the Egyptians will become weaklings. They will shudder with fear at the uplifted hand that the Lord Almighty raises against them.
23019017 And the land of Judah will bring terror to the Egyptians; everyone to whom Judah is mentioned will be terrified, because of what the Lord Almighty is planning against them.
23019018 In that day five cities in Egypt will speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the Lord Almighty. One of them will be called the City of the Sun.
23019019 In that day there will be an altar to the Lord in the heart of Egypt, and a monument to the Lord at its border.
23019020 It will be a sign and witness to the Lord Almighty in the land of Egypt. When they cry out to the Lord because of their oppressors, he will send them a savior and defender, and he will rescue them.
23019021 So the Lord will make himself known to the Egyptians, and in that day they will acknowledge the Lord. They will worship with sacrifices and grain offerings; they will make vows to the Lord and keep them.
23019022 The Lord will strike Egypt with a plague; he will strike them and heal them. They will turn to the Lord, and he will respond to their pleas and heal them.
23019023 In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together.
23019024 In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing on the earth.
23019025 The Lord Almighty will bless them, saying, “Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance.”
23020001 In the year that the supreme commander, sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and attacked and captured it—
23020002 at that time the Lord spoke through Isaiah son of Amoz. He said to him, “Take off the sackcloth from your body and the sandals from your feet.” And he did so, going around stripped and barefoot.
23020003 Then the Lord said, “Just as my servant Isaiah has gone stripped and barefoot for three years, as a sign and portent against Egypt and Cush,
23020004 so the king of Assyria will lead away stripped and barefoot the Egyptian captives and Cushite exiles, young and old, with buttocks bared—to Egypt’s shame.
23020005 Those who trusted in Cush and boasted in Egypt will be dismayed and put to shame.
23020006 In that day the people who live on this coast will say, ‘See what has happened to those we relied on, those we fled to for help and deliverance from the king of Assyria! How then can we escape?’ ”
23021001 A prophecy against the Desert by the Sea: Like whirlwinds sweeping through the southland, an invader comes from the desert, from a land of terror.
23021002 A dire vision has been shown to me: The traitor betrays, the looter takes loot. Elam, attack! Media, lay siege! I will bring to an end all the groaning she caused.
23021003 At this my body is racked with pain, pangs seize me, like those of a woman in labor; I am staggered by what I hear, I am bewildered by what I see.
23021004 My heart falters, fear makes me tremble; the twilight I longed for has become a horror to me.
23021005 They set the tables, they spread the rugs, they eat, they drink! Get up, you officers, oil the shields!
23021006 This is what the Lord says to me: “Go, post a lookout and have him report what he sees.
23021007 When he sees chariots with teams of horses, riders on donkeys or riders on camels, let him be alert, fully alert.”
23021008 And the lookout shouted, “Day after day, my lord, I stand on the watchtower; every night I stay at my post.
23021009 Look, here comes a man in a chariot with a team of horses. And he gives back the answer: ‘Babylon has fallen, has fallen! All the images of its gods lie shattered on the ground!’ ”
23021010 My people who are crushed on the threshing floor, I tell you what I have heard from the Lord Almighty, from the God of Israel.
23021011 A prophecy against Dumah : Someone calls to me from Seir, “Watchman, what is left of the night? Watchman, what is left of the night?”
23021012 The watchman replies, “Morning is coming, but also the night. If you would ask, then ask; and come back yet again.”
23021013 A prophecy against Arabia: You caravans of Dedanites, who camp in the thickets of Arabia,
23021014 bring water for the thirsty; you who live in Tema, bring food for the fugitives.
23021015 They flee from the sword, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow and from the heat of battle.
23021016 This is what the Lord says to me: “Within one year, as a servant bound by contract would count it, all the splendor of Kedar will come to an end.
23021017 The survivors of the archers, the warriors of Kedar, will be few.” The Lord, the God of Israel, has spoken.
23022001 A prophecy against the Valley of Vision: What troubles you now, that you have all gone up on the roofs,
23022002 you town so full of commotion, you city of tumult and revelry? Your slain were not killed by the sword, nor did they die in battle.
23022003 All your leaders have fled together; they have been captured without using the bow. All you who were caught were taken prisoner together, having fled while the enemy was still far away.
23022004 Therefore I said, “Turn away from me; let me weep bitterly. Do not try to console me over the destruction of my people.”
23022005 The Lord, the Lord Almighty, has a day of tumult and trampling and terror in the Valley of Vision, a day of battering down walls and of crying out to the mountains.
23022006 Elam takes up the quiver, with her charioteers and horses; Kir uncovers the shield.
23022007 Your choicest valleys are full of chariots, and horsemen are posted at the city gates.
23022008 The Lord stripped away the defenses of Judah, and you looked in that day to the weapons in the Palace of the Forest.
23022009 You saw that the walls of the City of David were broken through in many places; you stored up water in the Lower Pool.
23022010 You counted the buildings in Jerusalem and tore down houses to strengthen the wall.
23022011 You built a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the Old Pool, but you did not look to the One who made it, or have regard for the One who planned it long ago.
23022012 The Lord, the Lord Almighty, called you on that day to weep and to wail, to tear out your hair and put on sackcloth.
23022013 But see, there is joy and revelry, slaughtering of cattle and killing of sheep, eating of meat and drinking of wine! “Let us eat and drink,” you say, “for tomorrow we die!”
23022014 The Lord Almighty has revealed this in my hearing: “Till your dying day this sin will not be atoned for,” says the Lord, the Lord Almighty.
23022015 This is what the Lord, the Lord Almighty, says: “Go, say to this steward, to Shebna the palace administrator:
23022016 What are you doing here and who gave you permission to cut out a grave for yourself here, hewing your grave on the height and chiseling your resting place in the rock?
23022017 “Beware, the Lord is about to take firm hold of you and hurl you away, you mighty man.
23022018 He will roll you up tightly like a ball and throw you into a large country. There you will die and there the chariots you were so proud of will become a disgrace to your master’s house.
23022019 I will depose you from your office, and you will be ousted from your position.
23022020 “In that day I will summon my servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah.
23022021 I will clothe him with your robe and fasten your sash around him and hand your authority over to him. He will be a father to those who live in Jerusalem and to the people of Judah.
23022022 I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David; what he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open.
23022023 I will drive him like a peg into a firm place; he will become a seat of honor for the house of his father.
23022024 All the glory of his family will hang on him: its offspring and offshoots—all its lesser vessels, from the bowls to all the jars.
23022025 “In that day,” declares the Lord Almighty, “the peg driven into the firm place will give way; it will be sheared off and will fall, and the load hanging on it will be cut down.” The Lord has spoken.
23023001 A prophecy against Tyre: Wail, you ships of Tarshish! For Tyre is destroyed and left without house or harbor. From the land of Cyprus word has come to them.
23023002 Be silent, you people of the island and you merchants of Sidon, whom the seafarers have enriched.
23023003 On the great waters came the grain of the Shihor; the harvest of the Nile was the revenue of Tyre, and she became the marketplace of the nations.
23023004 Be ashamed, Sidon, and you fortress of the sea, for the sea has spoken: “I have neither been in labor nor given birth; I have neither reared sons nor brought up daughters.”
23023005 When word comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report from Tyre.
23023006 Cross over to Tarshish; wail, you people of the island.
23023007 Is this your city of revelry, the old, old city, whose feet have taken her to settle in far-off lands?
23023008 Who planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traders are renowned in the earth?
23023009 The Lord Almighty planned it, to bring down her pride in all her splendor and to humble all who are renowned on the earth.
23023010 Till your land as they do along the Nile, Daughter Tarshish, for you no longer have a harbor.
23023011 The Lord has stretched out his hand over the sea and made its kingdoms tremble. He has given an order concerning Phoenicia that her fortresses be destroyed.
23023012 He said, “No more of your reveling, Virgin Daughter Sidon, now crushed! “Up, cross over to Cyprus; even there you will find no rest.”
23023013 Look at the land of the Babylonians, this people that is now of no account! The Assyrians have made it a place for desert creatures; they raised up their siege towers, they stripped its fortresses bare and turned it into a ruin.
23023014 Wail, you ships of Tarshish; your fortress is destroyed!
23023015 At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the span of a king’s life. But at the end of these seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute:
23023016 “Take up a harp, walk through the city, you forgotten prostitute; play the harp well, sing many a song, so that you will be remembered.”
23023017 At the end of seventy years, the Lord will deal with Tyre. She will return to her lucrative prostitution and will ply her trade with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.
23023018 Yet her profit and her earnings will be set apart for the Lord; they will not be stored up or hoarded. Her profits will go to those who live before the Lord, for abundant food and fine clothes.
23024001 See, the Lord is going to lay waste the earth and devastate it; he will ruin its face and scatter its inhabitants—
23024002 it will be the same for priest as for people, for the master as for his servant, for the mistress as for her servant, for seller as for buyer, for borrower as for lender, for debtor as for creditor.
23024003 The earth will be completely laid waste and totally plundered. The Lord has spoken this word.
23024004 The earth dries up and withers, the world languishes and withers, the heavens languish with the earth.
23024005 The earth is defiled by its people; they have disobeyed the laws, violated the statutes and broken the everlasting covenant.
23024006 Therefore a curse consumes the earth; its people must bear their guilt. Therefore earth’s inhabitants are burned up, and very few are left.
23024007 The new wine dries up and the vine withers; all the merrymakers groan.
23024008 The joyful timbrels are stilled, the noise of the revelers has stopped, the joyful harp is silent.
23024009 No longer do they drink wine with a song; the beer is bitter to its drinkers.
23024010 The ruined city lies desolate; the entrance to every house is barred.
23024011 In the streets they cry out for wine; all joy turns to gloom, all joyful sounds are banished from the earth.
23024012 The city is left in ruins, its gate is battered to pieces.
23024013 So will it be on the earth and among the nations, as when an olive tree is beaten, or as when gleanings are left after the grape harvest.
23024014 They raise their voices, they shout for joy; from the west they acclaim the Lord’s majesty.
23024015 Therefore in the east give glory to the Lord; exalt the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, in the islands of the sea.
23024016 From the ends of the earth we hear singing: “Glory to the Righteous One.” But I said, “I waste away, I waste away! Woe to me! The treacherous betray! With treachery the treacherous betray!”
23024017 Terror and pit and snare await you, people of the earth.
23024018 Whoever flees at the sound of terror will fall into a pit; whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in a snare. The floodgates of the heavens are opened, the foundations of the earth shake.
23024019 The earth is broken up, the earth is split asunder, the earth is violently shaken.
23024020 The earth reels like a drunkard, it sways like a hut in the wind; so heavy upon it is the guilt of its rebellion that it falls—never to rise again.
23024021 In that day the Lord will punish the powers in the heavens above and the kings on the earth below.
23024022 They will be herded together like prisoners bound in a dungeon; they will be shut up in prison and be punished after many days.
23024023 The moon will be dismayed, the sun ashamed; for the Lord Almighty will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before its elders—with great glory.
23025001 Lord, you are my God; I will exalt you and praise your name, for in perfect faithfulness you have done wonderful things, things planned long ago.
23025002 You have made the city a heap of rubble, the fortified town a ruin, the foreigners’ stronghold a city no more; it will never be rebuilt.
23025003 Therefore strong peoples will honor you; cities of ruthless nations will revere you.
23025004 You have been a refuge for the poor, a refuge for the needy in their distress, a shelter from the storm and a shade from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless is like a storm driving against a wall
23025005 and like the heat of the desert. You silence the uproar of foreigners; as heat is reduced by the shadow of a cloud, so the song of the ruthless is stilled.
23025006 On this mountain the Lord Almighty will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples, a banquet of aged wine— the best of meats and the finest of wines.
23025007 On this mountain he will destroy the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the sheet that covers all nations;
23025008 he will swallow up death forever. The Sovereign Lord will wipe away the tears from all faces; he will remove his people’s disgrace from all the earth. The Lord has spoken.
23025009 In that day they will say, “Surely this is our God; we trusted in him, and he saved us. This is the Lord, we trusted in him; let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation.”
23025010 The hand of the Lord will rest on this mountain; but Moab will be trampled in their land as straw is trampled down in the manure.
23025011 They will stretch out their hands in it, as swimmers stretch out their hands to swim. God will bring down their pride despite the cleverness of their hands.
23025012 He will bring down your high fortified walls and lay them low; he will bring them down to the ground, to the very dust.
23026001 In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city; God makes salvation its walls and ramparts.
23026002 Open the gates that the righteous nation may enter, the nation that keeps faith.
23026003 You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast, because they trust in you.
23026004 Trust in the Lord forever, for the Lord, the Lord himself, is the Rock eternal.
23026005 He humbles those who dwell on high, he lays the lofty city low; he levels it to the ground and casts it down to the dust.
23026006 Feet trample it down— the feet of the oppressed, the footsteps of the poor.
23026007 The path of the righteous is level; you, the Upright One, make the way of the righteous smooth.
23026008 Yes, Lord, walking in the way of your laws, we wait for you; your name and renown are the desire of our hearts.
23026009 My soul yearns for you in the night; in the morning my spirit longs for you. When your judgments come upon the earth, the people of the world learn righteousness.
23026010 But when grace is shown to the wicked, they do not learn righteousness; even in a land of uprightness they go on doing evil and do not regard the majesty of the Lord.
23026011 Lord, your hand is lifted high, but they do not see it. Let them see your zeal for your people and be put to shame; let the fire reserved for your enemies consume them.
23026012 Lord, you establish peace for us; all that we have accomplished you have done for us.
23026013 Lord our God, other lords besides you have ruled over us, but your name alone do we honor.
23026014 They are now dead, they live no more; their spirits do not rise. You punished them and brought them to ruin; you wiped out all memory of them.
23026015 You have enlarged the nation, Lord; you have enlarged the nation. You have gained glory for yourself; you have extended all the borders of the land.
23026016 Lord, they came to you in their distress; when you disciplined them, they could barely whisper a prayer.
23026017 As a pregnant woman about to give birth writhes and cries out in her pain, so were we in your presence, Lord.
23026018 We were with child, we writhed in labor, but we gave birth to wind. We have not brought salvation to the earth, and the people of the world have not come to life.
23026019 But your dead will live, Lord; their bodies will rise— let those who dwell in the dust wake up and shout for joy— your dew is like the dew of the morning; the earth will give birth to her dead.
23026020 Go, my people, enter your rooms and shut the doors behind you; hide yourselves for a little while until his wrath has passed by.
23026021 See, the Lord is coming out of his dwelling to punish the people of the earth for their sins. The earth will disclose the blood shed on it; the earth will conceal its slain no longer.
23027001 In that day, the Lord will punish with his sword— his fierce, great and powerful sword— Leviathan the gliding serpent, Leviathan the coiling serpent; he will slay the monster of the sea.
23027002 In that day— “Sing about a fruitful vineyard:
23027003 I, the Lord, watch over it; I water it continually. I guard it day and night so that no one may harm it.
23027004 I am not angry. If only there were briers and thorns confronting me! I would march against them in battle; I would set them all on fire.
23027005 Or else let them come to me for refuge; let them make peace with me, yes, let them make peace with me.”
23027006 In days to come Jacob will take root, Israel will bud and blossom and fill all the world with fruit.
23027007 Has the Lord struck her as he struck down those who struck her? Has she been killed as those were killed who killed her?
23027008 By warfare and exile you contend with her— with his fierce blast he drives her out, as on a day the east wind blows.
23027009 By this, then, will Jacob’s guilt be atoned for, and this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin: When he makes all the altar stones to be like limestone crushed to pieces, no Asherah poles or incense altars will be left standing.
23027010 The fortified city stands desolate, an abandoned settlement, forsaken like the wilderness; there the calves graze, there they lie down; they strip its branches bare.
23027011 When its twigs are dry, they are broken off and women come and make fires with them. For this is a people without understanding; so their Maker has no compassion on them, and their Creator shows them no favor.
23027012 In that day the Lord will thresh from the flowing Euphrates to the Wadi of Egypt, and you, Israel, will be gathered up one by one.
23027013 And in that day a great trumpet will sound. Those who were perishing in Assyria and those who were exiled in Egypt will come and worship the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
23028001 Woe to that wreath, the pride of Ephraim’s drunkards, to the fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley— to that city, the pride of those laid low by wine!
23028002 See, the Lord has one who is powerful and strong. Like a hailstorm and a destructive wind, like a driving rain and a flooding downpour, he will throw it forcefully to the ground.
23028003 That wreath, the pride of Ephraim’s drunkards, will be trampled underfoot.
23028004 That fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley, will be like figs ripe before harvest— as soon as people see them and take them in hand, they swallow them.
23028005 In that day the Lord Almighty will be a glorious crown, a beautiful wreath for the remnant of his people.
23028006 He will be a spirit of justice to the one who sits in judgment, a source of strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.
23028007 And these also stagger from wine and reel from beer: Priests and prophets stagger from beer and are befuddled with wine; they reel from beer, they stagger when seeing visions, they stumble when rendering decisions.
23028008 All the tables are covered with vomit and there is not a spot without filth.
23028009 “Who is it he is trying to teach? To whom is he explaining his message? To children weaned from their milk, to those just taken from the breast?
23028010 For it is: Do this, do that, a rule for this, a rule for that ; a little here, a little there.”
23028011 Very well then, with foreign lips and strange tongues God will speak to this people,
23028012 to whom he said, “This is the resting place, let the weary rest”; and, “This is the place of repose”— but they would not listen.
23028013 So then, the word of the Lord to them will become: Do this, do that, a rule for this, a rule for that; a little here, a little there— so that as they go they will fall backward; they will be injured and snared and captured.
23028014 Therefore hear the word of the Lord, you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem.
23028015 You boast, “We have entered into a covenant with death, with the realm of the dead we have made an agreement. When an overwhelming scourge sweeps by, it cannot touch us, for we have made a lie our refuge and falsehood our hiding place.”
23028016 So this is what the Sovereign Lord says: “See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who relies on it will never be stricken with panic.
23028017 I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line; hail will sweep away your refuge, the lie, and water will overflow your hiding place.
23028018 Your covenant with death will be annulled; your agreement with the realm of the dead will not stand. When the overwhelming scourge sweeps by, you will be beaten down by it.
23028019 As often as it comes it will carry you away; morning after morning, by day and by night, it will sweep through.” The understanding of this message will bring sheer terror.
23028020 The bed is too short to stretch out on, the blanket too narrow to wrap around you.
23028021 The Lord will rise up as he did at Mount Perazim, he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon— to do his work, his strange work, and perform his task, his alien task.
23028022 Now stop your mocking, or your chains will become heavier; the Lord, the Lord Almighty, has told me of the destruction decreed against the whole land.
23028023 Listen and hear my voice; pay attention and hear what I say.
23028024 When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually? Does he keep on breaking up and working the soil?
23028025 When he has leveled the surface, does he not sow caraway and scatter cumin? Does he not plant wheat in its place, barley in its plot, and spelt in its field?
23028026 His God instructs him and teaches him the right way.
23028027 Caraway is not threshed with a sledge, nor is the wheel of a cart rolled over cumin; caraway is beaten out with a rod, and cumin with a stick.
23028028 Grain must be ground to make bread; so one does not go on threshing it forever. The wheels of a threshing cart may be rolled over it, but one does not use horses to grind grain.
23028029 All this also comes from the Lord Almighty, whose plan is wonderful, whose wisdom is magnificent.
23029001 Woe to you, Ariel, Ariel, the city where David settled! Add year to year and let your cycle of festivals go on.
23029002 Yet I will besiege Ariel; she will mourn and lament, she will be to me like an altar hearth.
23029003 I will encamp against you on all sides; I will encircle you with towers and set up my siege works against you.
23029004 Brought low, you will speak from the ground; your speech will mumble out of the dust. Your voice will come ghostlike from the earth; out of the dust your speech will whisper.
23029005 But your many enemies will become like fine dust, the ruthless hordes like blown chaff. Suddenly, in an instant,
23029006 the Lord Almighty will come with thunder and earthquake and great noise, with windstorm and tempest and flames of a devouring fire.
23029007 Then the hordes of all the nations that fight against Ariel, that attack her and her fortress and besiege her, will be as it is with a dream, with a vision in the night—
23029008 as when a hungry person dreams of eating, but awakens hungry still; as when a thirsty person dreams of drinking, but awakens faint and thirsty still. So will it be with the hordes of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion.
23029009 Be stunned and amazed, blind yourselves and be sightless; be drunk, but not from wine, stagger, but not from beer.
23029010 The Lord has brought over you a deep sleep: He has sealed your eyes (the prophets); he has covered your heads (the seers).
23029011 For you this whole vision is nothing but words sealed in a scroll. And if you give the scroll to someone who can read, and say, “Read this, please,” they will answer, “I can’t; it is sealed.”
23029012 Or if you give the scroll to someone who cannot read, and say, “Read this, please,” they will answer, “I don’t know how to read.”
23029013 The Lord says: “These people come near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. Their worship of me is based on merely human rules they have been taught.
23029014 Therefore once more I will astound these people with wonder upon wonder; the wisdom of the wise will perish, the intelligence of the intelligent will vanish.”
23029015 Woe to those who go to great depths to hide their plans from the Lord, who do their work in darkness and think, “Who sees us? Who will know?”
23029016 You turn things upside down, as if the potter were thought to be like the clay! Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it, “You did not make me”? Can the pot say to the potter, “You know nothing”?
23029017 In a very short time, will not Lebanon be turned into a fertile field and the fertile field seem like a forest?
23029018 In that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll, and out of gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see.
23029019 Once more the humble will rejoice in the Lord; the needy will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
23029020 The ruthless will vanish, the mockers will disappear, and all who have an eye for evil will be cut down—
23029021 those who with a word make someone out to be guilty, who ensnare the defender in court and with false testimony deprive the innocent of justice.
23029022 Therefore this is what the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, says to the descendants of Jacob: “No longer will Jacob be ashamed; no longer will their faces grow pale.
23029023 When they see among them their children, the work of my hands, they will keep my name holy; they will acknowledge the holiness of the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.
23029024 Those who are wayward in spirit will gain understanding; those who complain will accept instruction.”
23030001 “Woe to the obstinate children,” declares the Lord, “to those who carry out plans that are not mine, forming an alliance, but not by my Spirit, heaping sin upon sin;
23030002 who go down to Egypt without consulting me; who look for help to Pharaoh’s protection, to Egypt’s shade for refuge.
23030003 But Pharaoh’s protection will be to your shame, Egypt’s shade will bring you disgrace.
23030004 Though they have officials in Zoan and their envoys have arrived in Hanes,
23030005 everyone will be put to shame because of a people useless to them, who bring neither help nor advantage, but only shame and disgrace.”
23030006 A prophecy concerning the animals of the Negev: Through a land of hardship and distress, of lions and lionesses, of adders and darting snakes, the envoys carry their riches on donkeys’ backs, their treasures on the humps of camels, to that unprofitable nation,
23030007 to Egypt, whose help is utterly useless. Therefore I call her Rahab the Do-Nothing.
23030008 Go now, write it on a tablet for them, inscribe it on a scroll, that for the days to come it may be an everlasting witness.
23030009 For these are rebellious people, deceitful children, children unwilling to listen to the Lord’s instruction.
23030010 They say to the seers, “See no more visions!” and to the prophets, “Give us no more visions of what is right! Tell us pleasant things, prophesy illusions.
23030011 Leave this way, get off this path, and stop confronting us with the Holy One of Israel!”
23030012 Therefore this is what the Holy One of Israel says: “Because you have rejected this message, relied on oppression and depended on deceit,
23030013 this sin will become for you like a high wall, cracked and bulging, that collapses suddenly, in an instant.
23030014 It will break in pieces like pottery, shattered so mercilessly that among its pieces not a fragment will be found for taking coals from a hearth or scooping water out of a cistern.”
23030015 This is what the Sovereign Lord, the Holy One of Israel, says: “In repentance and rest is your salvation, in quietness and trust is your strength, but you would have none of it.
23030016 You said, ‘No, we will flee on horses.’ Therefore you will flee! You said, ‘We will ride off on swift horses.’ Therefore your pursuers will be swift!
23030017 A thousand will flee at the threat of one; at the threat of five you will all flee away, till you are left like a flagstaff on a mountaintop, like a banner on a hill.”
23030018 Yet the Lord longs to be gracious to you; therefore he will rise up to show you compassion. For the Lord is a God of justice. Blessed are all who wait for him!
23030019 People of Zion, who live in Jerusalem, you will weep no more. How gracious he will be when you cry for help! As soon as he hears, he will answer you.
23030020 Although the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, your teachers will be hidden no more; with your own eyes you will see them.
23030021 Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, “This is the way; walk in it.”
23030022 Then you will desecrate your idols overlaid with silver and your images covered with gold; you will throw them away like a menstrual cloth and say to them, “Away with you!”
23030023 He will also send you rain for the seed you sow in the ground, and the food that comes from the land will be rich and plentiful. In that day your cattle will graze in broad meadows.
23030024 The oxen and donkeys that work the soil will eat fodder and mash, spread out with fork and shovel.
23030025 In the day of great slaughter, when the towers fall, streams of water will flow on every high mountain and every lofty hill.
23030026 The moon will shine like the sun, and the sunlight will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven full days, when the Lord binds up the bruises of his people and heals the wounds he inflicted.
23030027 See, the Name of the Lord comes from afar, with burning anger and dense clouds of smoke; his lips are full of wrath, and his tongue is a consuming fire.
23030028 His breath is like a rushing torrent, rising up to the neck. He shakes the nations in the sieve of destruction; he places in the jaws of the peoples a bit that leads them astray.
23030029 And you will sing as on the night you celebrate a holy festival; your hearts will rejoice as when people playing pipes go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the Rock of Israel.
23030030 The Lord will cause people to hear his majestic voice and will make them see his arm coming down with raging anger and consuming fire, with cloudburst, thunderstorm and hail.
23030031 The voice of the Lord will shatter Assyria; with his rod he will strike them down.
23030032 Every stroke the Lord lays on them with his punishing club will be to the music of timbrels and harps, as he fights them in battle with the blows of his arm.
23030033 Topheth has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king. Its fire pit has been made deep and wide, with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze.
23031001 Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, who rely on horses, who trust in the multitude of their chariots and in the great strength of their horsemen, but do not look to the Holy One of Israel, or seek help from the Lord.
23031002 Yet he too is wise and can bring disaster; he does not take back his words. He will rise up against that wicked nation, against those who help evildoers.
23031003 But the Egyptians are mere mortals and not God; their horses are flesh and not spirit. When the Lord stretches out his hand, those who help will stumble, those who are helped will fall; all will perish together.
23031004 This is what the Lord says to me: “As a lion growls, a great lion over its prey— and though a whole band of shepherds is called together against it, it is not frightened by their shouts or disturbed by their clamor— so the Lord Almighty will come down to do battle on Mount Zion and on its heights.
23031005 Like birds hovering overhead, the Lord Almighty will shield Jerusalem; he will shield it and deliver it, he will ‘pass over’ it and will rescue it.”
23031006 Return, you Israelites, to the One you have so greatly revolted against.
23031007 For in that day every one of you will reject the idols of silver and gold your sinful hands have made.
23031008 “Assyria will fall by no human sword; a sword, not of mortals, will devour them. They will flee before the sword and their young men will be put to forced labor.
23031009 Their stronghold will fall because of terror; at the sight of the battle standard their commanders will panic,” declares the Lord, whose fire is in Zion, whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
23032001 See, a king will reign in righteousness and rulers will rule with justice.
23032002 Each one will be like a shelter from the wind and a refuge from the storm, like streams of water in the desert and the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land.
23032003 Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed, and the ears of those who hear will listen.
23032004 The fearful heart will know and understand, and the stammering tongue will be fluent and clear.
23032005 No longer will the fool be called noble nor the scoundrel be highly respected.
23032006 For fools speak folly, their hearts are bent on evil: They practice ungodliness and spread error concerning the Lord; the hungry they leave empty and from the thirsty they withhold water.
23032007 Scoundrels use wicked methods, they make up evil schemes to destroy the poor with lies, even when the plea of the needy is just.
23032008 But the noble make noble plans, and by noble deeds they stand.
23032009 You women who are so complacent, rise up and listen to me; you daughters who feel secure, hear what I have to say!
23032010 In little more than a year you who feel secure will tremble; the grape harvest will fail, and the harvest of fruit will not come.
23032011 Tremble, you complacent women; shudder, you daughters who feel secure! Strip off your fine clothes and wrap yourselves in rags.
23032012 Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vines
23032013 and for the land of my people, a land overgrown with thorns and briers— yes, mourn for all houses of merriment and for this city of revelry.
23032014 The fortress will be abandoned, the noisy city deserted; citadel and watchtower will become a wasteland forever, the delight of donkeys, a pasture for flocks,
23032015 till the Spirit is poured on us from on high, and the desert becomes a fertile field, and the fertile field seems like a forest.
23032016 The Lord’s justice will dwell in the desert, his righteousness live in the fertile field.
23032017 The fruit of that righteousness will be peace; its effect will be quietness and confidence forever.
23032018 My people will live in peaceful dwelling places, in secure homes, in undisturbed places of rest.
23032019 Though hail flattens the forest and the city is leveled completely,
23032020 how blessed you will be, sowing your seed by every stream, and letting your cattle and donkeys range free.
23033001 Woe to you, destroyer, you who have not been destroyed! Woe to you, betrayer, you who have not been betrayed! When you stop destroying, you will be destroyed; when you stop betraying, you will be betrayed.
23033002 Lord, be gracious to us; we long for you. Be our strength every morning, our salvation in time of distress.
23033003 At the uproar of your army, the peoples flee; when you rise up, the nations scatter.
23033004 Your plunder, O nations, is harvested as by young locusts; like a swarm of locusts people pounce on it.
23033005 The Lord is exalted, for he dwells on high; he will fill Zion with his justice and righteousness.
23033006 He will be the sure foundation for your times, a rich store of salvation and wisdom and knowledge; the fear of the Lord is the key to this treasure.
23033007 Look, their brave men cry aloud in the streets; the envoys of peace weep bitterly.
23033008 The highways are deserted, no travelers are on the roads. The treaty is broken, its witnesses are despised, no one is respected.
23033009 The land dries up and wastes away, Lebanon is ashamed and withers; Sharon is like the Arabah, and Bashan and Carmel drop their leaves.
23033010 “Now will I arise,” says the Lord. “Now will I be exalted; now will I be lifted up.
23033011 You conceive chaff, you give birth to straw; your breath is a fire that consumes you.
23033012 The peoples will be burned to ashes; like cut thornbushes they will be set ablaze.”
23033013 You who are far away, hear what I have done; you who are near, acknowledge my power!
23033014 The sinners in Zion are terrified; trembling grips the godless: “Who of us can dwell with the consuming fire? Who of us can dwell with everlasting burning?”
23033015 Those who walk righteously and speak what is right, who reject gain from extortion and keep their hands from accepting bribes, who stop their ears against plots of murder and shut their eyes against contemplating evil—
23033016 they are the ones who will dwell on the heights, whose refuge will be the mountain fortress. Their bread will be supplied, and water will not fail them.
23033017 Your eyes will see the king in his beauty and view a land that stretches afar.
23033018 In your thoughts you will ponder the former terror: “Where is that chief officer? Where is the one who took the revenue? Where is the officer in charge of the towers?”
23033019 You will see those arrogant people no more, people whose speech is obscure, whose language is strange and incomprehensible.
23033020 Look on Zion, the city of our festivals; your eyes will see Jerusalem, a peaceful abode, a tent that will not be moved; its stakes will never be pulled up, nor any of its ropes broken.
23033021 There the Lord will be our Mighty One. It will be like a place of broad rivers and streams. No galley with oars will ride them, no mighty ship will sail them.
23033022 For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king; it is he who will save us.
23033023 Your rigging hangs loose: The mast is not held secure, the sail is not spread. Then an abundance of spoils will be divided and even the lame will carry off plunder.
23033024 No one living in Zion will say, “I am ill”; and the sins of those who dwell there will be forgiven.
23034001 Come near, you nations, and listen; pay attention, you peoples! Let the earth hear, and all that is in it, the world, and all that comes out of it!
23034002 The Lord is angry with all nations; his wrath is on all their armies. He will totally destroy them, he will give them over to slaughter.
23034003 Their slain will be thrown out, their dead bodies will stink; the mountains will be soaked with their blood.
23034004 All the stars in the sky will be dissolved and the heavens rolled up like a scroll; all the starry host will fall like withered leaves from the vine, like shriveled figs from the fig tree.
23034005 My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; see, it descends in judgment on Edom, the people I have totally destroyed.
23034006 The sword of the Lord is bathed in blood, it is covered with fat— the blood of lambs and goats, fat from the kidneys of rams. For the Lord has a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
23034007 And the wild oxen will fall with them, the bull calves and the great bulls. Their land will be drenched with blood, and the dust will be soaked with fat.
23034008 For the Lord has a day of vengeance, a year of retribution, to uphold Zion’s cause.
23034009 Edom’s streams will be turned into pitch, her dust into burning sulfur; her land will become blazing pitch!
23034010 It will not be quenched night or day; its smoke will rise forever. From generation to generation it will lie desolate; no one will ever pass through it again.
23034011 The desert owl and screech owl will possess it; the great owl and the raven will nest there. God will stretch out over Edom the measuring line of chaos and the plumb line of desolation.
23034012 Her nobles will have nothing there to be called a kingdom, all her princes will vanish away.
23034013 Thorns will overrun her citadels, nettles and brambles her strongholds. She will become a haunt for jackals, a home for owls.
23034014 Desert creatures will meet with hyenas, and wild goats will bleat to each other; there the night creatures will also lie down and find for themselves places of rest.
23034015 The owl will nest there and lay eggs, she will hatch them, and care for her young under the shadow of her wings; there also the falcons will gather, each with its mate.
23034016 Look in the scroll of the Lord and read: None of these will be missing, not one will lack her mate. For it is his mouth that has given the order, and his Spirit will gather them together.
23034017 He allots their portions; his hand distributes them by measure. They will possess it forever and dwell there from generation to generation.
23035001 The desert and the parched land will be glad; the wilderness will rejoice and blossom. Like the crocus,
23035002 it will burst into bloom; it will rejoice greatly and shout for joy. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon; they will see the glory of the Lord, the splendor of our God.
23035003 Strengthen the feeble hands, steady the knees that give way;
23035004 say to those with fearful hearts, “Be strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance; with divine retribution he will come to save you.”
23035005 Then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped.
23035006 Then will the lame leap like a deer, and the mute tongue shout for joy. Water will gush forth in the wilderness and streams in the desert.
23035007 The burning sand will become a pool, the thirsty ground bubbling springs. In the haunts where jackals once lay, grass and reeds and papyrus will grow.
23035008 And a highway will be there; it will be called the Way of Holiness; it will be for those who walk on that Way. The unclean will not journey on it; wicked fools will not go about on it.
23035009 No lion will be there, nor any ravenous beast; they will not be found there. But only the redeemed will walk there,
23035010 and those the Lord has rescued will return. They will enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.
23036001 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah’s reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
23036002 Then the king of Assyria sent his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. When the commander stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field,
23036003 Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to him.
23036004 The field commander said to them, “Tell Hezekiah: “ ‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: On what are you basing this confidence of yours?
23036005 You say you have counsel and might for war—but you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me?
23036006 Look, I know you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him.
23036007 But if you say to me, “We are depending on the Lord our God”—isn’t he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, “You must worship before this altar”?
23036008 “ ‘Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses—if you can put riders on them!
23036009 How then can you repulse one officer of the least of my master’s officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen ?
23036010 Furthermore, have I come to attack and destroy this land without the Lord? The Lord himself told me to march against this country and destroy it.’ ”
23036011 Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to the field commander, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don’t speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall.”
23036012 But the commander replied, “Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the people sitting on the wall—who, like you, will have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine?”
23036013 Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!
23036014 This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you!
23036015 Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the Lord when he says, ‘The Lord will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’
23036016 “Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then each of you will eat fruit from your own vine and fig tree and drink water from your own cistern,
23036017 until I come and take you to a land like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
23036018 “Do not let Hezekiah mislead you when he says, ‘The Lord will deliver us.’ Have the gods of any nations ever delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria?
23036019 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand?
23036020 Who of all the gods of these countries have been able to save their lands from me? How then can the Lord deliver Jerusalem from my hand?”
23036021 But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the king had commanded, “Do not answer him.”
23036022 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah, with their clothes torn, and told him what the field commander had said.
23037001 When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the Lord.
23037002 He sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
23037003 They told him, “This is what Hezekiah says: This day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace, as when children come to the moment of birth and there is no strength to deliver them.
23037004 It may be that the Lord your God will hear the words of the field commander, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to ridicule the living God, and that he will rebuke him for the words the Lord your God has heard. Therefore pray for the remnant that still survives.”
23037005 When King Hezekiah’s officials came to Isaiah,
23037006 Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master, ‘This is what the Lord says: Do not be afraid of what you have heard—those words with which the underlings of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
23037007 Listen! When he hears a certain report, I will make him want to return to his own country, and there I will have him cut down with the sword.’ ”
23037008 When the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah.
23037009 Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah, the king of Cush, was marching out to fight against him. When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word:
23037010 “Say to Hezekiah king of Judah: Do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says, ‘Jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria.’
23037011 Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries, destroying them completely. And will you be delivered?
23037012 Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my predecessors deliver them—the gods of Gozan, Harran, Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar?
23037013 Where is the king of Hamath or the king of Arpad? Where are the kings of Lair, Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah?”
23037014 Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the Lord and spread it out before the Lord.
23037015 And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord:
23037016 “Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.
23037017 Give ear, Lord, and hear; open your eyes, Lord, and see; listen to all the words Sennacherib has sent to ridicule the living God.
23037018 “It is true, Lord, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste all these peoples and their lands.
23037019 They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by human hands.
23037020 Now, Lord our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, Lord, are the only God. ”
23037021 Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,
23037022 this is the word the Lord has spoken against him: “Virgin Daughter Zion despises and mocks you. Daughter Jerusalem tosses her head as you flee.
23037023 Who is it you have ridiculed and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!
23037024 By your messengers you have ridiculed the Lord. And you have said, ‘With my many chariots I have ascended the heights of the mountains, the utmost heights of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, the choicest of its junipers. I have reached its remotest heights, the finest of its forests.
23037025 I have dug wells in foreign lands and drunk the water there. With the soles of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.’
23037026 “Have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it. In days of old I planned it; now I have brought it to pass, that you have turned fortified cities into piles of stone.
23037027 Their people, drained of power, are dismayed and put to shame. They are like plants in the field, like tender green shoots, like grass sprouting on the roof, scorched before it grows up.
23037028 “But I know where you are and when you come and go and how you rage against me.
23037029 Because you rage against me and because your insolence has reached my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will make you return by the way you came.
23037030 “This will be the sign for you, Hezekiah: “This year you will eat what grows by itself, and the second year what springs from that. But in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
23037031 Once more a remnant of the kingdom of Judah will take root below and bear fruit above.
23037032 For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this.
23037033 “Therefore this is what the Lord says concerning the king of Assyria: “He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here. He will not come before it with shield or build a siege ramp against it.
23037034 By the way that he came he will return; he will not enter this city,” declares the Lord.
23037035 “I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant!”
23037036 Then the angel of the Lord went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning—there were all the dead bodies!
23037037 So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.
23037038 One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisrok, his sons Adrammelek and Sharezer killed him with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king.
23038001 In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said, “This is what the Lord says: Put your house in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover.”
23038002 Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord,
23038003 “Remember, Lord, how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
23038004 Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah:
23038005 “Go and tell Hezekiah, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will add fifteen years to your life.
23038006 And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city.
23038007 “ ‘This is the Lord’s sign to you that the Lord will do what he has promised:
23038008 I will make the shadow cast by the sun go back the ten steps it has gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.’ ” So the sunlight went back the ten steps it had gone down.
23038009 A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery:
23038010 I said, “In the prime of my life must I go through the gates of death and be robbed of the rest of my years?”
23038011 I said, “I will not again see the Lord himself in the land of the living; no longer will I look on my fellow man, or be with those who now dwell in this world.
23038012 Like a shepherd’s tent my house has been pulled down and taken from me. Like a weaver I have rolled up my life, and he has cut me off from the loom; day and night you made an end of me.
23038013 I waited patiently till dawn, but like a lion he broke all my bones; day and night you made an end of me.
23038014 I cried like a swift or thrush, I moaned like a mourning dove. My eyes grew weak as I looked to the heavens. I am being threatened; Lord, come to my aid!”
23038015 But what can I say? He has spoken to me, and he himself has done this. I will walk humbly all my years because of this anguish of my soul.
23038016 Lord, by such things people live; and my spirit finds life in them too. You restored me to health and let me live.
23038017 Surely it was for my benefit that I suffered such anguish. In your love you kept me from the pit of destruction; you have put all my sins behind your back.
23038018 For the grave cannot praise you, death cannot sing your praise; those who go down to the pit cannot hope for your faithfulness.
23038019 The living, the living—they praise you, as I am doing today; parents tell their children about your faithfulness.
23038020 The Lord will save me, and we will sing with stringed instruments all the days of our lives in the temple of the Lord.
23038021 Isaiah had said, “Prepare a poultice of figs and apply it to the boil, and he will recover.”
23038022 Hezekiah had asked, “What will be the sign that I will go up to the temple of the Lord?”
23039001 At that time Marduk-Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent Hezekiah letters and a gift, because he had heard of his illness and recovery.
23039002 Hezekiah received the envoys gladly and showed them what was in his storehouses—the silver, the gold, the spices, the fine olive oil—his entire armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.
23039003 Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked, “What did those men say, and where did they come from?” “From a distant land,” Hezekiah replied. “They came to me from Babylon.”
23039004 The prophet asked, “What did they see in your palace?” “They saw everything in my palace,” Hezekiah said. “There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them.”
23039005 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the Lord Almighty:
23039006 The time will surely come when everything in your palace, and all that your predecessors have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the Lord.
23039007 And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood who will be born to you, will be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”
23039008 “The word of the Lord you have spoken is good,” Hezekiah replied. For he thought, “There will be peace and security in my lifetime.”
23040001 Comfort, comfort my people, says your God.
23040002 Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and proclaim to her that her hard service has been completed, that her sin has been paid for, that she has received from the Lord’s hand double for all her sins.
23040003 A voice of one calling: “In the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord ; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
23040004 Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground shall become level, the rugged places a plain.
23040005 And the glory of the Lord will be revealed, and all people will see it together. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.”
23040006 A voice says, “Cry out.” And I said, “What shall I cry?” “All people are like grass, and all their faithfulness is like the flowers of the field.
23040007 The grass withers and the flowers fall, because the breath of the Lord blows on them. Surely the people are grass.
23040008 The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God endures forever.”
23040009 You who bring good news to Zion, go up on a high mountain. You who bring good news to Jerusalem, lift up your voice with a shout, lift it up, do not be afraid; say to the towns of Judah, “Here is your God!”
23040010 See, the Sovereign Lord comes with power, and he rules with a mighty arm. See, his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him.
23040011 He tends his flock like a shepherd: He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart; he gently leads those that have young.
23040012 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens? Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket, or weighed the mountains on the scales and the hills in a balance?
23040013 Who can fathom the Spirit of the Lord, or instruct the Lord as his counselor?
23040014 Whom did the Lord consult to enlighten him, and who taught him the right way? Who was it that taught him knowledge, or showed him the path of understanding?
23040015 Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket; they are regarded as dust on the scales; he weighs the islands as though they were fine dust.
23040016 Lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires, nor its animals enough for burnt offerings.
23040017 Before him all the nations are as nothing; they are regarded by him as worthless and less than nothing.
23040018 With whom, then, will you compare God? To what image will you liken him?
23040019 As for an idol, a metalworker casts it, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and fashions silver chains for it.
23040020 A person too poor to present such an offering selects wood that will not rot; they look for a skilled worker to set up an idol that will not topple.
23040021 Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood since the earth was founded?
23040022 He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in.
23040023 He brings princes to naught and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing.
23040024 No sooner are they planted, no sooner are they sown, no sooner do they take root in the ground, than he blows on them and they wither, and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff.
23040025 “To whom will you compare me? Or who is my equal?” says the Holy One.
23040026 Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one and calls forth each of them by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing.
23040027 Why do you complain, Jacob? Why do you say, Israel, “My way is hidden from the Lord; my cause is disregarded by my God”?
23040028 Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom.
23040029 He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak.
23040030 Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall;
23040031 but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.
23041001 “Be silent before me, you islands! Let the nations renew their strength! Let them come forward and speak; let us meet together at the place of judgment.
23041002 “Who has stirred up one from the east, calling him in righteousness to his service ? He hands nations over to him and subdues kings before him. He turns them to dust with his sword, to windblown chaff with his bow.
23041003 He pursues them and moves on unscathed, by a path his feet have not traveled before.
23041004 Who has done this and carried it through, calling forth the generations from the beginning? I, the Lord—with the first of them and with the last—I am he.”
23041005 The islands have seen it and fear; the ends of the earth tremble. They approach and come forward;
23041006 they help each other and say to their companions, “Be strong!”
23041007 The metalworker encourages the goldsmith, and the one who smooths with the hammer spurs on the one who strikes the anvil. One says of the welding, “It is good.” The other nails down the idol so it will not topple.
23041008 “But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, you descendants of Abraham my friend,
23041009 I took you from the ends of the earth, from its farthest corners I called you. I said, ‘You are my servant’; I have chosen you and have not rejected you.
23041010 So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.
23041011 “All who rage against you will surely be ashamed and disgraced; those who oppose you will be as nothing and perish.
23041012 Though you search for your enemies, you will not find them. Those who wage war against you will be as nothing at all.
23041013 For I am the Lord your God who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, Do not fear; I will help you.
23041014 Do not be afraid, you worm Jacob, little Israel, do not fear, for I myself will help you,” declares the Lord, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.
23041015 “See, I will make you into a threshing sledge, new and sharp, with many teeth. You will thresh the mountains and crush them, and reduce the hills to chaff.
23041016 You will winnow them, the wind will pick them up, and a gale will blow them away. But you will rejoice in the Lord and glory in the Holy One of Israel.
23041017 “The poor and needy search for water, but there is none; their tongues are parched with thirst. But I the Lord will answer them; I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.
23041018 I will make rivers flow on barren heights, and springs within the valleys. I will turn the desert into pools of water, and the parched ground into springs.
23041019 I will put in the desert the cedar and the acacia, the myrtle and the olive. I will set junipers in the wasteland, the fir and the cypress together,
23041020 so that people may see and know, may consider and understand, that the hand of the Lord has done this, that the Holy One of Israel has created it.
23041021 “Present your case,” says the Lord. “Set forth your arguments,” says Jacob’s King.
23041022 “Tell us, you idols, what is going to happen. Tell us what the former things were, so that we may consider them and know their final outcome. Or declare to us the things to come,
23041023 tell us what the future holds, so we may know that you are gods. Do something, whether good or bad, so that we will be dismayed and filled with fear.
23041024 But you are less than nothing and your works are utterly worthless; whoever chooses you is detestable.
23041025 “I have stirred up one from the north, and he comes— one from the rising sun who calls on my name. He treads on rulers as if they were mortar, as if he were a potter treading the clay.
23041026 Who told of this from the beginning, so we could know, or beforehand, so we could say, ‘He was right’? No one told of this, no one foretold it, no one heard any words from you.
23041027 I was the first to tell Zion, ‘Look, here they are!’ I gave to Jerusalem a messenger of good news.
23041028 I look but there is no one— no one among the gods to give counsel, no one to give answer when I ask them.
23041029 See, they are all false! Their deeds amount to nothing; their images are but wind and confusion.
23042001 “Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will bring justice to the nations.
23042002 He will not shout or cry out, or raise his voice in the streets.
23042003 A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out. In faithfulness he will bring forth justice;
23042004 he will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth. In his teaching the islands will put their hope.”
23042005 This is what God the Lord says— the Creator of the heavens, who stretches them out, who spreads out the earth with all that springs from it, who gives breath to its people, and life to those who walk on it:
23042006 “I, the Lord, have called you in righteousness; I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people and a light for the Gentiles,
23042007 to open eyes that are blind, to free captives from prison and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness.
23042008 “I am the Lord; that is my name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.
23042009 See, the former things have taken place, and new things I declare; before they spring into being I announce them to you.”
23042010 Sing to the Lord a new song, his praise from the ends of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it, you islands, and all who live in them.
23042011 Let the wilderness and its towns raise their voices; let the settlements where Kedar lives rejoice. Let the people of Sela sing for joy; let them shout from the mountaintops.
23042012 Let them give glory to the Lord and proclaim his praise in the islands.
23042013 The Lord will march out like a champion, like a warrior he will stir up his zeal; with a shout he will raise the battle cry and will triumph over his enemies.
23042014 “For a long time I have kept silent, I have been quiet and held myself back. But now, like a woman in childbirth, I cry out, I gasp and pant.
23042015 I will lay waste the mountains and hills and dry up all their vegetation; I will turn rivers into islands and dry up the pools.
23042016 I will lead the blind by ways they have not known, along unfamiliar paths I will guide them; I will turn the darkness into light before them and make the rough places smooth. These are the things I will do; I will not forsake them.
23042017 But those who trust in idols, who say to images, ‘You are our gods,’ will be turned back in utter shame.
23042018 “Hear, you deaf; look, you blind, and see!
23042019 Who is blind but my servant, and deaf like the messenger I send? Who is blind like the one in covenant with me, blind like the servant of the Lord?
23042020 You have seen many things, but you pay no attention; your ears are open, but you do not listen.”
23042021 It pleased the Lord for the sake of his righteousness to make his law great and glorious.
23042022 But this is a people plundered and looted, all of them trapped in pits or hidden away in prisons. They have become plunder, with no one to rescue them; they have been made loot, with no one to say, “Send them back.”
23042023 Which of you will listen to this or pay close attention in time to come?
23042024 Who handed Jacob over to become loot, and Israel to the plunderers? Was it not the Lord, against whom we have sinned? For they would not follow his ways; they did not obey his law.
23042025 So he poured out on them his burning anger, the violence of war. It enveloped them in flames, yet they did not understand; it consumed them, but they did not take it to heart.
23043001 But now, this is what the Lord says— he who created you, Jacob, he who formed you, Israel: “Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine.
23043002 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze.
23043003 For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I give Egypt for your ransom, Cush and Seba in your stead.
23043004 Since you are precious and honored in my sight, and because I love you, I will give people in exchange for you, nations in exchange for your life.
23043005 Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bring your children from the east and gather you from the west.
23043006 I will say to the north, ‘Give them up!’ and to the south, ‘Do not hold them back.’ Bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the earth—
23043007 everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made.”
23043008 Lead out those who have eyes but are blind, who have ears but are deaf.
23043009 All the nations gather together and the peoples assemble. Which of their gods foretold this and proclaimed to us the former things? Let them bring in their witnesses to prove they were right, so that others may hear and say, “It is true.”
23043010 “You are my witnesses,” declares the Lord, “and my servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he. Before me no god was formed, nor will there be one after me.
23043011 I, even I, am the Lord, and apart from me there is no savior.
23043012 I have revealed and saved and proclaimed— I, and not some foreign god among you. You are my witnesses,” declares the Lord, “that I am God.
23043013 Yes, and from ancient days I am he. No one can deliver out of my hand. When I act, who can reverse it?”
23043014 This is what the Lord says— your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: “For your sake I will send to Babylon and bring down as fugitives all the Babylonians, in the ships in which they took pride.
23043015 I am the Lord, your Holy One, Israel’s Creator, your King.”
23043016 This is what the Lord says— he who made a way through the sea, a path through the mighty waters,
23043017 who drew out the chariots and horses, the army and reinforcements together, and they lay there, never to rise again, extinguished, snuffed out like a wick:
23043018 “Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past.
23043019 See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland.
23043020 The wild animals honor me, the jackals and the owls, because I provide water in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland, to give drink to my people, my chosen,
23043021 the people I formed for myself that they may proclaim my praise.
23043022 “Yet you have not called on me, Jacob, you have not wearied yourselves for me, Israel.
23043023 You have not brought me sheep for burnt offerings, nor honored me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with grain offerings nor wearied you with demands for incense.
23043024 You have not bought any fragrant calamus for me, or lavished on me the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened me with your sins and wearied me with your offenses.
23043025 “I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more.
23043026 Review the past for me, let us argue the matter together; state the case for your innocence.
23043027 Your first father sinned; those I sent to teach you rebelled against me.
23043028 So I disgraced the dignitaries of your temple; I consigned Jacob to destruction and Israel to scorn.
23044001 “But now listen, Jacob, my servant, Israel, whom I have chosen.
23044002 This is what the Lord says— he who made you, who formed you in the womb, and who will help you: Do not be afraid, Jacob, my servant, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
23044003 For I will pour water on the thirsty land, and streams on the dry ground; I will pour out my Spirit on your offspring, and my blessing on your descendants.
23044004 They will spring up like grass in a meadow, like poplar trees by flowing streams.
23044005 Some will say, ‘I belong to the Lord’; others will call themselves by the name of Jacob; still others will write on their hand, ‘The Lord’s,’ and will take the name Israel.
23044006 “This is what the Lord says— Israel’s King and Redeemer, the Lord Almighty: I am the first and I am the last; apart from me there is no God.
23044007 Who then is like me? Let him proclaim it. Let him declare and lay out before me what has happened since I established my ancient people, and what is yet to come— yes, let them foretell what will come.
23044008 Do not tremble, do not be afraid. Did I not proclaim this and foretell it long ago? You are my witnesses. Is there any God besides me? No, there is no other Rock; I know not one.”
23044009 All who make idols are nothing, and the things they treasure are worthless. Those who would speak up for them are blind; they are ignorant, to their own shame.
23044010 Who shapes a god and casts an idol, which can profit nothing?
23044011 People who do that will be put to shame; such craftsmen are only human beings. Let them all come together and take their stand; they will be brought down to terror and shame.
23044012 The blacksmith takes a tool and works with it in the coals; he shapes an idol with hammers, he forges it with the might of his arm. He gets hungry and loses his strength; he drinks no water and grows faint.
23044013 The carpenter measures with a line and makes an outline with a marker; he roughs it out with chisels and marks it with compasses. He shapes it in human form, human form in all its glory, that it may dwell in a shrine.
23044014 He cut down cedars, or perhaps took a cypress or oak. He let it grow among the trees of the forest, or planted a pine, and the rain made it grow.
23044015 It is used as fuel for burning; some of it he takes and warms himself, he kindles a fire and bakes bread. But he also fashions a god and worships it; he makes an idol and bows down to it.
23044016 Half of the wood he burns in the fire; over it he prepares his meal, he roasts his meat and eats his fill. He also warms himself and says, “Ah! I am warm; I see the fire.”
23044017 From the rest he makes a god, his idol; he bows down to it and worships. He prays to it and says, “Save me! You are my god!”
23044018 They know nothing, they understand nothing; their eyes are plastered over so they cannot see, and their minds closed so they cannot understand.
23044019 No one stops to think, no one has the knowledge or understanding to say, “Half of it I used for fuel; I even baked bread over its coals, I roasted meat and I ate. Shall I make a detestable thing from what is left? Shall I bow down to a block of wood?”
23044020 Such a person feeds on ashes; a deluded heart misleads him; he cannot save himself, or say, “Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?”
23044021 “Remember these things, Jacob, for you, Israel, are my servant. I have made you, you are my servant; Israel, I will not forget you.
23044022 I have swept away your offenses like a cloud, your sins like the morning mist. Return to me, for I have redeemed you.”
23044023 Sing for joy, you heavens, for the Lord has done this; shout aloud, you earth beneath. Burst into song, you mountains, you forests and all your trees, for the Lord has redeemed Jacob, he displays his glory in Israel.
23044024 “This is what the Lord says— your Redeemer, who formed you in the womb: I am the Lord, the Maker of all things, who stretches out the heavens, who spreads out the earth by myself,
23044025 who foils the signs of false prophets and makes fools of diviners, who overthrows the learning of the wise and turns it into nonsense,
23044026 who carries out the words of his servants and fulfills the predictions of his messengers, who says of Jerusalem, ‘It shall be inhabited,’ of the towns of Judah, ‘They shall be rebuilt,’ and of their ruins, ‘I will restore them,’
23044027 who says to the watery deep, ‘Be dry, and I will dry up your streams,’
23044028 who says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd and will accomplish all that I please; he will say of Jerusalem, “Let it be rebuilt,” and of the temple, “Let its foundations be laid.” ’
23045001 “This is what the Lord says to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I take hold of to subdue nations before him and to strip kings of their armor, to open doors before him so that gates will not be shut:
23045002 I will go before you and will level the mountains ; I will break down gates of bronze and cut through bars of iron.
23045003 I will give you hidden treasures, riches stored in secret places, so that you may know that I am the Lord, the God of Israel, who summons you by name.
23045004 For the sake of Jacob my servant, of Israel my chosen, I summon you by name and bestow on you a title of honor, though you do not acknowledge me.
23045005 I am the Lord, and there is no other; apart from me there is no God. I will strengthen you, though you have not acknowledged me,
23045006 so that from the rising of the sun to the place of its setting people may know there is none besides me. I am the Lord, and there is no other.
23045007 I form the light and create darkness, I bring prosperity and create disaster; I, the Lord, do all these things.
23045008 “You heavens above, rain down my righteousness; let the clouds shower it down. Let the earth open wide, let salvation spring up, let righteousness flourish with it; I, the Lord, have created it.
23045009 “Woe to those who quarrel with their Maker, those who are nothing but potsherds among the potsherds on the ground. Does the clay say to the potter, ‘What are you making?’ Does your work say, ‘The potter has no hands’?
23045010 Woe to the one who says to a father, ‘What have you begotten?’ or to a mother, ‘What have you brought to birth?’
23045011 “This is what the Lord says— the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker: Concerning things to come, do you question me about my children, or give me orders about the work of my hands?
23045012 It is I who made the earth and created mankind on it. My own hands stretched out the heavens; I marshaled their starry hosts.
23045013 I will raise up Cyrus in my righteousness: I will make all his ways straight. He will rebuild my city and set my exiles free, but not for a price or reward, says the Lord Almighty.”
23045014 This is what the Lord says: “The products of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush, and those tall Sabeans— they will come over to you and will be yours; they will trudge behind you, coming over to you in chains. They will bow down before you and plead with you, saying, ‘Surely God is with you, and there is no other; there is no other god.’ ”
23045015 Truly you are a God who has been hiding himself, the God and Savior of Israel.
23045016 All the makers of idols will be put to shame and disgraced; they will go off into disgrace together.
23045017 But Israel will be saved by the Lord with an everlasting salvation; you will never be put to shame or disgraced, to ages everlasting.
23045018 For this is what the Lord says— he who created the heavens, he is God; he who fashioned and made the earth, he founded it; he did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited— he says: “I am the Lord, and there is no other.
23045019 I have not spoken in secret, from somewhere in a land of darkness; I have not said to Jacob’s descendants, ‘Seek me in vain.’ I, the Lord, speak the truth; I declare what is right.
23045020 “Gather together and come; assemble, you fugitives from the nations. Ignorant are those who carry about idols of wood, who pray to gods that cannot save.
23045021 Declare what is to be, present it— let them take counsel together. Who foretold this long ago, who declared it from the distant past? Was it not I, the Lord? And there is no God apart from me, a righteous God and a Savior; there is none but me.
23045022 “Turn to me and be saved, all you ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other.
23045023 By myself I have sworn, my mouth has uttered in all integrity a word that will not be revoked: Before me every knee will bow; by me every tongue will swear.
23045024 They will say of me, ‘In the Lord alone are deliverance and strength.’ ” All who have raged against him will come to him and be put to shame.
23045025 But all the descendants of Israel will find deliverance in the Lord and will make their boast in him.
23046001 Bel bows down, Nebo stoops low; their idols are borne by beasts of burden. The images that are carried about are burdensome, a burden for the weary.
23046002 They stoop and bow down together; unable to rescue the burden, they themselves go off into captivity.
23046003 “Listen to me, you descendants of Jacob, all the remnant of the people of Israel, you whom I have upheld since your birth, and have carried since you were born.
23046004 Even to your old age and gray hairs I am he, I am he who will sustain you. I have made you and I will carry you; I will sustain you and I will rescue you.
23046005 “With whom will you compare me or count me equal? To whom will you liken me that we may be compared?
23046006 Some pour out gold from their bags and weigh out silver on the scales; they hire a goldsmith to make it into a god, and they bow down and worship it.
23046007 They lift it to their shoulders and carry it; they set it up in its place, and there it stands. From that spot it cannot move. Even though someone cries out to it, it cannot answer; it cannot save them from their troubles.
23046008 “Remember this, keep it in mind, take it to heart, you rebels.
23046009 Remember the former things, those of long ago; I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me.
23046010 I make known the end from the beginning, from ancient times, what is still to come. I say, ‘My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please.’
23046011 From the east I summon a bird of prey; from a far-off land, a man to fulfill my purpose. What I have said, that I will bring about; what I have planned, that I will do.
23046012 Listen to me, you stubborn-hearted, you who are now far from my righteousness.
23046013 I am bringing my righteousness near, it is not far away; and my salvation will not be delayed. I will grant salvation to Zion, my splendor to Israel.
23047001 “Go down, sit in the dust, Virgin Daughter Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, queen city of the Babylonians. No more will you be called tender or delicate.
23047002 Take millstones and grind flour; take off your veil. Lift up your skirts, bare your legs, and wade through the streams.
23047003 Your nakedness will be exposed and your shame uncovered. I will take vengeance; I will spare no one.”
23047004 Our Redeemer—the Lord Almighty is his name— is the Holy One of Israel.
23047005 “Sit in silence, go into darkness, queen city of the Babylonians; no more will you be called queen of kingdoms.
23047006 I was angry with my people and desecrated my inheritance; I gave them into your hand, and you showed them no mercy. Even on the aged you laid a very heavy yoke.
23047007 You said, ‘I am forever— the eternal queen!’ But you did not consider these things or reflect on what might happen.
23047008 “Now then, listen, you lover of pleasure, lounging in your security and saying to yourself, ‘I am, and there is none besides me. I will never be a widow or suffer the loss of children.’
23047009 Both of these will overtake you in a moment, on a single day: loss of children and widowhood. They will come upon you in full measure, in spite of your many sorceries and all your potent spells.
23047010 You have trusted in your wickedness and have said, ‘No one sees me.’ Your wisdom and knowledge mislead you when you say to yourself, ‘I am, and there is none besides me.’
23047011 Disaster will come upon you, and you will not know how to conjure it away. A calamity will fall upon you that you cannot ward off with a ransom; a catastrophe you cannot foresee will suddenly come upon you.
23047012 “Keep on, then, with your magic spells and with your many sorceries, which you have labored at since childhood. Perhaps you will succeed, perhaps you will cause terror.
23047013 All the counsel you have received has only worn you out! Let your astrologers come forward, those stargazers who make predictions month by month, let them save you from what is coming upon you.
23047014 Surely they are like stubble; the fire will burn them up. They cannot even save themselves from the power of the flame. These are not coals for warmth; this is not a fire to sit by.
23047015 That is all they are to you— these you have dealt with and labored with since childhood. All of them go on in their error; there is not one that can save you.
23048001 “Listen to this, you descendants of Jacob, you who are called by the name of Israel and come from the line of Judah, you who take oaths in the name of the Lord and invoke the God of Israel— but not in truth or righteousness—
23048002 you who call yourselves citizens of the holy city and claim to rely on the God of Israel— the Lord Almighty is his name:
23048003 I foretold the former things long ago, my mouth announced them and I made them known; then suddenly I acted, and they came to pass.
23048004 For I knew how stubborn you were; your neck muscles were iron, your forehead was bronze.
23048005 Therefore I told you these things long ago; before they happened I announced them to you so that you could not say, ‘My images brought them about; my wooden image and metal god ordained them.’
23048006 You have heard these things; look at them all. Will you not admit them? “From now on I will tell you of new things, of hidden things unknown to you.
23048007 They are created now, and not long ago; you have not heard of them before today. So you cannot say, ‘Yes, I knew of them.’
23048008 You have neither heard nor understood; from of old your ears have not been open. Well do I know how treacherous you are; you were called a rebel from birth.
23048009 For my own name’s sake I delay my wrath; for the sake of my praise I hold it back from you, so as not to destroy you completely.
23048010 See, I have refined you, though not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.
23048011 For my own sake, for my own sake, I do this. How can I let myself be defamed? I will not yield my glory to another.
23048012 “Listen to me, Jacob, Israel, whom I have called: I am he; I am the first and I am the last.
23048013 My own hand laid the foundations of the earth, and my right hand spread out the heavens; when I summon them, they all stand up together.
23048014 “Come together, all of you, and listen: Which of the idols has foretold these things? The Lord’s chosen ally will carry out his purpose against Babylon; his arm will be against the Babylonians.
23048015 I, even I, have spoken; yes, I have called him. I will bring him, and he will succeed in his mission.
23048016 “Come near me and listen to this: “From the first announcement I have not spoken in secret; at the time it happens, I am there.” And now the Sovereign Lord has sent me, endowed with his Spirit.
23048017 This is what the Lord says— your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: “I am the Lord your God, who teaches you what is best for you, who directs you in the way you should go.
23048018 If only you had paid attention to my commands, your peace would have been like a river, your well-being like the waves of the sea.
23048019 Your descendants would have been like the sand, your children like its numberless grains; their name would never be blotted out nor destroyed from before me.”
23048020 Leave Babylon, flee from the Babylonians! Announce this with shouts of joy and proclaim it. Send it out to the ends of the earth; say, “The Lord has redeemed his servant Jacob.”
23048021 They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts; he made water flow for them from the rock; he split the rock and water gushed out.
23048022 “There is no peace,” says the Lord, “for the wicked.”
23049001 Listen to me, you islands; hear this, you distant nations: Before I was born the Lord called me; from my mother’s womb he has spoken my name.
23049002 He made my mouth like a sharpened sword, in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me into a polished arrow and concealed me in his quiver.
23049003 He said to me, “You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will display my splendor.”
23049004 But I said, “I have labored in vain; I have spent my strength for nothing at all. Yet what is due me is in the Lord’s hand, and my reward is with my God.”
23049005 And now the Lord says— he who formed me in the womb to be his servant to bring Jacob back to him and gather Israel to himself, for I am honored in the eyes of the Lord and my God has been my strength—
23049006 he says: “It is too small a thing for you to be my servant to restore the tribes of Jacob and bring back those of Israel I have kept. I will also make you a light for the Gentiles, that my salvation may reach to the ends of the earth.”
23049007 This is what the Lord says— the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel— to him who was despised and abhorred by the nation, to the servant of rulers: “Kings will see you and stand up, princes will see and bow down, because of the Lord, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”
23049008 This is what the Lord says: “In the time of my favor I will answer you, and in the day of salvation I will help you; I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people, to restore the land and to reassign its desolate inheritances,
23049009 to say to the captives, ‘Come out,’ and to those in darkness, ‘Be free!’ “They will feed beside the roads and find pasture on every barren hill.
23049010 They will neither hunger nor thirst, nor will the desert heat or the sun beat down on them. He who has compassion on them will guide them and lead them beside springs of water.
23049011 I will turn all my mountains into roads, and my highways will be raised up.
23049012 See, they will come from afar— some from the north, some from the west, some from the region of Aswan. ”
23049013 Shout for joy, you heavens; rejoice, you earth; burst into song, you mountains! For the Lord comforts his people and will have compassion on his afflicted ones.
23049014 But Zion said, “The Lord has forsaken me, the Lord has forgotten me.”
23049015 “Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne? Though she may forget, I will not forget you!
23049016 See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; your walls are ever before me.
23049017 Your children hasten back, and those who laid you waste depart from you.
23049018 Lift up your eyes and look around; all your children gather and come to you. As surely as I live,” declares the Lord, “you will wear them all as ornaments; you will put them on, like a bride.
23049019 “Though you were ruined and made desolate and your land laid waste, now you will be too small for your people, and those who devoured you will be far away.
23049020 The children born during your bereavement will yet say in your hearing, ‘This place is too small for us; give us more space to live in.’
23049021 Then you will say in your heart, ‘Who bore me these? I was bereaved and barren; I was exiled and rejected. Who brought these up? I was left all alone, but these—where have they come from?’ ”
23049022 This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “See, I will beckon to the nations, I will lift up my banner to the peoples; they will bring your sons in their arms and carry your daughters on their hips.
23049023 Kings will be your foster fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers. They will bow down before you with their faces to the ground; they will lick the dust at your feet. Then you will know that I am the Lord; those who hope in me will not be disappointed.”
23049024 Can plunder be taken from warriors, or captives be rescued from the fierce ?
23049025 But this is what the Lord says: “Yes, captives will be taken from warriors, and plunder retrieved from the fierce; I will contend with those who contend with you, and your children I will save.
23049026 I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh; they will be drunk on their own blood, as with wine. Then all mankind will know that I, the Lord, am your Savior, your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”
23050001 This is what the Lord says: “Where is your mother’s certificate of divorce with which I sent her away? Or to which of my creditors did I sell you? Because of your sins you were sold; because of your transgressions your mother was sent away.
23050002 When I came, why was there no one? When I called, why was there no one to answer? Was my arm too short to deliver you? Do I lack the strength to rescue you? By a mere rebuke I dry up the sea, I turn rivers into a desert; their fish rot for lack of water and die of thirst.
23050003 I clothe the heavens with darkness and make sackcloth its covering.”
23050004 The Sovereign Lord has given me a well-instructed tongue, to know the word that sustains the weary. He wakens me morning by morning, wakens my ear to listen like one being instructed.
23050005 The Sovereign Lord has opened my ears; I have not been rebellious, I have not turned away.
23050006 I offered my back to those who beat me, my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard; I did not hide my face from mocking and spitting.
23050007 Because the Sovereign Lord helps me, I will not be disgraced. Therefore have I set my face like flint, and I know I will not be put to shame.
23050008 He who vindicates me is near. Who then will bring charges against me? Let us face each other! Who is my accuser? Let him confront me!
23050009 It is the Sovereign Lord who helps me. Who will condemn me? They will all wear out like a garment; the moths will eat them up.
23050010 Who among you fears the Lord and obeys the word of his servant? Let the one who walks in the dark, who has no light, trust in the name of the Lord and rely on their God.
23050011 But now, all you who light fires and provide yourselves with flaming torches, go, walk in the light of your fires and of the torches you have set ablaze. This is what you shall receive from my hand: You will lie down in torment.
23051001 “Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness and who seek the Lord: Look to the rock from which you were cut and to the quarry from which you were hewn;
23051002 look to Abraham, your father, and to Sarah, who gave you birth. When I called him he was only one man, and I blessed him and made him many.
23051003 The Lord will surely comfort Zion and will look with compassion on all her ruins; he will make her deserts like Eden, her wastelands like the garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and the sound of singing.
23051004 “Listen to me, my people; hear me, my nation: Instruction will go out from me; my justice will become a light to the nations.
23051005 My righteousness draws near speedily, my salvation is on the way, and my arm will bring justice to the nations. The islands will look to me and wait in hope for my arm.
23051006 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, look at the earth beneath; the heavens will vanish like smoke, the earth will wear out like a garment and its inhabitants die like flies. But my salvation will last forever, my righteousness will never fail.
23051007 “Hear me, you who know what is right, you people who have taken my instruction to heart: Do not fear the reproach of mere mortals or be terrified by their insults.
23051008 For the moth will eat them up like a garment; the worm will devour them like wool. But my righteousness will last forever, my salvation through all generations.”
23051009 Awake, awake, arm of the Lord, clothe yourself with strength! Awake, as in days gone by, as in generations of old. Was it not you who cut Rahab to pieces, who pierced that monster through?
23051010 Was it not you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, who made a road in the depths of the sea so that the redeemed might cross over?
23051011 Those the Lord has rescued will return. They will enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.
23051012 “I, even I, am he who comforts you. Who are you that you fear mere mortals, human beings who are but grass,
23051013 that you forget the Lord your Maker, who stretches out the heavens and who lays the foundations of the earth, that you live in constant terror every day because of the wrath of the oppressor, who is bent on destruction? For where is the wrath of the oppressor?
23051014 The cowering prisoners will soon be set free; they will not die in their dungeon, nor will they lack bread.
23051015 For I am the Lord your God, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar— the Lord Almighty is his name.
23051016 I have put my words in your mouth and covered you with the shadow of my hand— I who set the heavens in place, who laid the foundations of the earth, and who say to Zion, ‘You are my people.’ ”
23051017 Awake, awake! Rise up, Jerusalem, you who have drunk from the hand of the Lord the cup of his wrath, you who have drained to its dregs the goblet that makes people stagger.
23051018 Among all the children she bore there was none to guide her; among all the children she reared there was none to take her by the hand.
23051019 These double calamities have come upon you— who can comfort you?— ruin and destruction, famine and sword— who can console you?
23051020 Your children have fainted; they lie at every street corner, like antelope caught in a net. They are filled with the wrath of the Lord, with the rebuke of your God.
23051021 Therefore hear this, you afflicted one, made drunk, but not with wine.
23051022 This is what your Sovereign Lord says, your God, who defends his people: “See, I have taken out of your hand the cup that made you stagger; from that cup, the goblet of my wrath, you will never drink again.
23051023 I will put it into the hands of your tormentors, who said to you, ‘Fall prostrate that we may walk on you.’ And you made your back like the ground, like a street to be walked on.”
23052001 Awake, awake, Zion, clothe yourself with strength! Put on your garments of splendor, Jerusalem, the holy city. The uncircumcised and defiled will not enter you again.
23052002 Shake off your dust; rise up, sit enthroned, Jerusalem. Free yourself from the chains on your neck, Daughter Zion, now a captive.
23052003 For this is what the Lord says: “You were sold for nothing, and without money you will be redeemed.”
23052004 For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: “At first my people went down to Egypt to live; lately, Assyria has oppressed them.
23052005 “And now what do I have here?” declares the Lord. “For my people have been taken away for nothing, and those who rule them mock, ” declares the Lord. “And all day long my name is constantly blasphemed.
23052006 Therefore my people will know my name; therefore in that day they will know that it is I who foretold it. Yes, it is I.”
23052007 How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace, who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation, who say to Zion, “Your God reigns!”
23052008 Listen! Your watchmen lift up their voices; together they shout for joy. When the Lord returns to Zion, they will see it with their own eyes.
23052009 Burst into songs of joy together, you ruins of Jerusalem, for the Lord has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.
23052010 The Lord will lay bare his holy arm in the sight of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God.
23052011 Depart, depart, go out from there! Touch no unclean thing! Come out from it and be pure, you who carry the articles of the Lord’s house.
23052012 But you will not leave in haste or go in flight; for the Lord will go before you, the God of Israel will be your rear guard.
23052013 See, my servant will act wisely ; he will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted.
23052014 Just as there were many who were appalled at him — his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any human being and his form marred beyond human likeness—
23052015 so he will sprinkle many nations, and kings will shut their mouths because of him. For what they were not told, they will see, and what they have not heard, they will understand.
23053001 Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
23053002 He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.
23053003 He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain. Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised, and we held him in low esteem.
23053004 Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted.
23053005 But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed.
23053006 We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
23053007 He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.
23053008 By oppression and judgment he was taken away. Yet who of his generation protested? For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was punished.
23053009 He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth.
23053010 Yet it was the Lord’s will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the Lord makes his life an offering for sin, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand.
23053011 After he has suffered, he will see the light of life and be satisfied ; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities.
23053012 Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors. For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
23054001 “Sing, barren woman, you who never bore a child; burst into song, shout for joy, you who were never in labor; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband,” says the Lord.
23054002 “Enlarge the place of your tent, stretch your tent curtains wide, do not hold back; lengthen your cords, strengthen your stakes.
23054003 For you will spread out to the right and to the left; your descendants will dispossess nations and settle in their desolate cities.
23054004 “Do not be afraid; you will not be put to shame. Do not fear disgrace; you will not be humiliated. You will forget the shame of your youth and remember no more the reproach of your widowhood.
23054005 For your Maker is your husband— the Lord Almighty is his name— the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; he is called the God of all the earth.
23054006 The Lord will call you back as if you were a wife deserted and distressed in spirit— a wife who married young, only to be rejected,” says your God.
23054007 “For a brief moment I abandoned you, but with deep compassion I will bring you back.
23054008 In a surge of anger I hid my face from you for a moment, but with everlasting kindness I will have compassion on you,” says the Lord your Redeemer.
23054009 “To me this is like the days of Noah, when I swore that the waters of Noah would never again cover the earth. So now I have sworn not to be angry with you, never to rebuke you again.
23054010 Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed, yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken nor my covenant of peace be removed,” says the Lord, who has compassion on you.
23054011 “Afflicted city, lashed by storms and not comforted, I will rebuild you with stones of turquoise, your foundations with lapis lazuli.
23054012 I will make your battlements of rubies, your gates of sparkling jewels, and all your walls of precious stones.
23054013 All your children will be taught by the Lord, and great will be their peace.
23054014 In righteousness you will be established: Tyranny will be far from you; you will have nothing to fear. Terror will be far removed; it will not come near you.
23054015 If anyone does attack you, it will not be my doing; whoever attacks you will surrender to you.
23054016 “See, it is I who created the blacksmith who fans the coals into flame and forges a weapon fit for its work. And it is I who have created the destroyer to wreak havoc;
23054017 no weapon forged against you will prevail, and you will refute every tongue that accuses you. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and this is their vindication from me,” declares the Lord.
23055001 “Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters; and you who have no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost.
23055002 Why spend money on what is not bread, and your labor on what does not satisfy? Listen, listen to me, and eat what is good, and you will delight in the richest of fare.
23055003 Give ear and come to me; listen, that you may live. I will make an everlasting covenant with you, my faithful love promised to David.
23055004 See, I have made him a witness to the peoples, a ruler and commander of the peoples.
23055005 Surely you will summon nations you know not, and nations you do not know will come running to you, because of the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, for he has endowed you with splendor.”
23055006 Seek the Lord while he may be found; call on him while he is near.
23055007 Let the wicked forsake their ways and the unrighteous their thoughts. Let them turn to the Lord, and he will have mercy on them, and to our God, for he will freely pardon.
23055008 “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,” declares the Lord.
23055009 “As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.
23055010 As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater,
23055011 so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.
23055012 You will go out in joy and be led forth in peace; the mountains and hills will burst into song before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands.
23055013 Instead of the thornbush will grow the juniper, and instead of briers the myrtle will grow. This will be for the Lord’s renown, for an everlasting sign, that will endure forever.”
23056001 This is what the Lord says: “Maintain justice and do what is right, for my salvation is close at hand and my righteousness will soon be revealed.
23056002 Blessed is the one who does this— the person who holds it fast, who keeps the Sabbath without desecrating it, and keeps their hands from doing any evil.”
23056003 Let no foreigner who is bound to the Lord say, “The Lord will surely exclude me from his people.” And let no eunuch complain, “I am only a dry tree.”
23056004 For this is what the Lord says: “To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, who choose what pleases me and hold fast to my covenant—
23056005 to them I will give within my temple and its walls a memorial and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that will endure forever.
23056006 And foreigners who bind themselves to the Lord to minister to him, to love the name of the Lord, and to be his servants, all who keep the Sabbath without desecrating it and who hold fast to my covenant—
23056007 these I will bring to my holy mountain and give them joy in my house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on my altar; for my house will be called a house of prayer for all nations.”
23056008 The Sovereign Lord declares— he who gathers the exiles of Israel: “I will gather still others to them besides those already gathered.”
23056009 Come, all you beasts of the field, come and devour, all you beasts of the forest!
23056010 Israel’s watchmen are blind, they all lack knowledge; they are all mute dogs, they cannot bark; they lie around and dream, they love to sleep.
23056011 They are dogs with mighty appetites; they never have enough. They are shepherds who lack understanding; they all turn to their own way, they seek their own gain.
23056012 “Come,” each one cries, “let me get wine! Let us drink our fill of beer! And tomorrow will be like today, or even far better.”
23057001 The righteous perish, and no one takes it to heart; the devout are taken away, and no one understands that the righteous are taken away to be spared from evil.
23057002 Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; they find rest as they lie in death.
23057003 “But you—come here, you children of a sorceress, you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes!
23057004 Who are you mocking? At whom do you sneer and stick out your tongue? Are you not a brood of rebels, the offspring of liars?
23057005 You burn with lust among the oaks and under every spreading tree; you sacrifice your children in the ravines and under the overhanging crags.
23057006 The idols among the smooth stones of the ravines are your portion; indeed, they are your lot. Yes, to them you have poured out drink offerings and offered grain offerings. In view of all this, should I relent?
23057007 You have made your bed on a high and lofty hill; there you went up to offer your sacrifices.
23057008 Behind your doors and your doorposts you have put your pagan symbols. Forsaking me, you uncovered your bed, you climbed into it and opened it wide; you made a pact with those whose beds you love, and you looked with lust on their naked bodies.
23057009 You went to Molek with olive oil and increased your perfumes. You sent your ambassadors far away; you descended to the very realm of the dead!
23057010 You wearied yourself by such going about, but you would not say, ‘It is hopeless.’ You found renewal of your strength, and so you did not faint.
23057011 “Whom have you so dreaded and feared that you have not been true to me, and have neither remembered me nor taken this to heart? Is it not because I have long been silent that you do not fear me?
23057012 I will expose your righteousness and your works, and they will not benefit you.
23057013 When you cry out for help, let your collection of idols save you! The wind will carry all of them off, a mere breath will blow them away. But whoever takes refuge in me will inherit the land and possess my holy mountain.”
23057014 And it will be said: “Build up, build up, prepare the road! Remove the obstacles out of the way of my people.”
23057015 For this is what the high and exalted One says— he who lives forever, whose name is holy: “I live in a high and holy place, but also with the one who is contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite.
23057016 I will not accuse them forever, nor will I always be angry, for then they would faint away because of me— the very people I have created.
23057017 I was enraged by their sinful greed; I punished them, and hid my face in anger, yet they kept on in their willful ways.
23057018 I have seen their ways, but I will heal them; I will guide them and restore comfort to Israel’s mourners,
23057019 creating praise on their lips. Peace, peace, to those far and near,” says the Lord. “And I will heal them.”
23057020 But the wicked are like the tossing sea, which cannot rest, whose waves cast up mire and mud.
23057021 “There is no peace,” says my God, “for the wicked.”
23058001 “Shout it aloud, do not hold back. Raise your voice like a trumpet. Declare to my people their rebellion and to the descendants of Jacob their sins.
23058002 For day after day they seek me out; they seem eager to know my ways, as if they were a nation that does what is right and has not forsaken the commands of its God. They ask me for just decisions and seem eager for God to come near them.
23058003 ‘Why have we fasted,’ they say, ‘and you have not seen it? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you have not noticed?’ “Yet on the day of your fasting, you do as you please and exploit all your workers.
23058004 Your fasting ends in quarreling and strife, and in striking each other with wicked fists. You cannot fast as you do today and expect your voice to be heard on high.
23058005 Is this the kind of fast I have chosen, only a day for people to humble themselves? Is it only for bowing one’s head like a reed and for lying in sackcloth and ashes? Is that what you call a fast, a day acceptable to the Lord?
23058006 “Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen: to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke?
23058007 Is it not to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter— when you see the naked, to clothe them, and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood?
23058008 Then your light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will quickly appear; then your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the Lord will be your rear guard.
23058009 Then you will call, and the Lord will answer; you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I. “If you do away with the yoke of oppression, with the pointing finger and malicious talk,
23058010 and if you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed, then your light will rise in the darkness, and your night will become like the noonday.
23058011 The Lord will guide you always; he will satisfy your needs in a sun-scorched land and will strengthen your frame. You will be like a well-watered garden, like a spring whose waters never fail.
23058012 Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins and will raise up the age-old foundations; you will be called Repairer of Broken Walls, Restorer of Streets with Dwellings.
23058013 “If you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath and from doing as you please on my holy day, if you call the Sabbath a delight and the Lord’s holy day honorable, and if you honor it by not going your own way and not doing as you please or speaking idle words,
23058014 then you will find your joy in the Lord, and I will cause you to ride in triumph on the heights of the land and to feast on the inheritance of your father Jacob.” The mouth of the Lord has spoken.
23059001 Surely the arm of the Lord is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear.
23059002 But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear.
23059003 For your hands are stained with blood, your fingers with guilt. Your lips have spoken falsely, and your tongue mutters wicked things.
23059004 No one calls for justice; no one pleads a case with integrity. They rely on empty arguments, they utter lies; they conceive trouble and give birth to evil.
23059005 They hatch the eggs of vipers and spin a spider’s web. Whoever eats their eggs will die, and when one is broken, an adder is hatched.
23059006 Their cobwebs are useless for clothing; they cannot cover themselves with what they make. Their deeds are evil deeds, and acts of violence are in their hands.
23059007 Their feet rush into sin; they are swift to shed innocent blood. They pursue evil schemes; acts of violence mark their ways.
23059008 The way of peace they do not know; there is no justice in their paths. They have turned them into crooked roads; no one who walks along them will know peace.
23059009 So justice is far from us, and righteousness does not reach us. We look for light, but all is darkness; for brightness, but we walk in deep shadows.
23059010 Like the blind we grope along the wall, feeling our way like people without eyes. At midday we stumble as if it were twilight; among the strong, we are like the dead.
23059011 We all growl like bears; we moan mournfully like doves. We look for justice, but find none; for deliverance, but it is far away.
23059012 For our offenses are many in your sight, and our sins testify against us. Our offenses are ever with us, and we acknowledge our iniquities:
23059013 rebellion and treachery against the Lord, turning our backs on our God, inciting revolt and oppression, uttering lies our hearts have conceived.
23059014 So justice is driven back, and righteousness stands at a distance; truth has stumbled in the streets, honesty cannot enter.
23059015 Truth is nowhere to be found, and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey. The Lord looked and was displeased that there was no justice.
23059016 He saw that there was no one, he was appalled that there was no one to intervene; so his own arm achieved salvation for him, and his own righteousness sustained him.
23059017 He put on righteousness as his breastplate, and the helmet of salvation on his head; he put on the garments of vengeance and wrapped himself in zeal as in a cloak.
23059018 According to what they have done, so will he repay wrath to his enemies and retribution to his foes; he will repay the islands their due.
23059019 From the west, people will fear the name of the Lord, and from the rising of the sun, they will revere his glory. For he will come like a pent-up flood that the breath of the Lord drives along.
23059020 “The Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who repent of their sins,” declares the Lord.
23059021 “As for me, this is my covenant with them,” says the Lord. “My Spirit, who is on you, will not depart from you, and my words that I have put in your mouth will always be on your lips, on the lips of your children and on the lips of their descendants—from this time on and forever,” says the Lord.
23060001 “Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord rises upon you.
23060002 See, darkness covers the earth and thick darkness is over the peoples, but the Lord rises upon you and his glory appears over you.
23060003 Nations will come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawn.
23060004 “Lift up your eyes and look about you: All assemble and come to you; your sons come from afar, and your daughters are carried on the hip.
23060005 Then you will look and be radiant, your heart will throb and swell with joy; the wealth on the seas will be brought to you, to you the riches of the nations will come.
23060006 Herds of camels will cover your land, young camels of Midian and Ephah. And all from Sheba will come, bearing gold and incense and proclaiming the praise of the Lord.
23060007 All Kedar’s flocks will be gathered to you, the rams of Nebaioth will serve you; they will be accepted as offerings on my altar, and I will adorn my glorious temple.
23060008 “Who are these that fly along like clouds, like doves to their nests?
23060009 Surely the islands look to me; in the lead are the ships of Tarshish, bringing your children from afar, with their silver and gold, to the honor of the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, for he has endowed you with splendor.
23060010 “Foreigners will rebuild your walls, and their kings will serve you. Though in anger I struck you, in favor I will show you compassion.
23060011 Your gates will always stand open, they will never be shut, day or night, so that people may bring you the wealth of the nations— their kings led in triumphal procession.
23060012 For the nation or kingdom that will not serve you will perish; it will be utterly ruined.
23060013 “The glory of Lebanon will come to you, the juniper, the fir and the cypress together, to adorn my sanctuary; and I will glorify the place for my feet.
23060014 The children of your oppressors will come bowing before you; all who despise you will bow down at your feet and will call you the City of the Lord, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
23060015 “Although you have been forsaken and hated, with no one traveling through, I will make you the everlasting pride and the joy of all generations.
23060016 You will drink the milk of nations and be nursed at royal breasts. Then you will know that I, the Lord, am your Savior, your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
23060017 Instead of bronze I will bring you gold, and silver in place of iron. Instead of wood I will bring you bronze, and iron in place of stones. I will make peace your governor and well-being your ruler.
23060018 No longer will violence be heard in your land, nor ruin or destruction within your borders, but you will call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise.
23060019 The sun will no more be your light by day, nor will the brightness of the moon shine on you, for the Lord will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory.
23060020 Your sun will never set again, and your moon will wane no more; the Lord will be your everlasting light, and your days of sorrow will end.
23060021 Then all your people will be righteous and they will possess the land forever. They are the shoot I have planted, the work of my hands, for the display of my splendor.
23060022 The least of you will become a thousand, the smallest a mighty nation. I am the Lord; in its time I will do this swiftly.”
23061001 The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me, because the Lord has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners,
23061002 to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn,
23061003 and provide for those who grieve in Zion— to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor.
23061004 They will rebuild the ancient ruins and restore the places long devastated; they will renew the ruined cities that have been devastated for generations.
23061005 Strangers will shepherd your flocks; foreigners will work your fields and vineyards.
23061006 And you will be called priests of the Lord, you will be named ministers of our God. You will feed on the wealth of nations, and in their riches you will boast.
23061007 Instead of your shame you will receive a double portion, and instead of disgrace you will rejoice in your inheritance. And so you will inherit a double portion in your land, and everlasting joy will be yours.
23061008 “For I, the Lord, love justice; I hate robbery and wrongdoing. In my faithfulness I will reward my people and make an everlasting covenant with them.
23061009 Their descendants will be known among the nations and their offspring among the peoples. All who see them will acknowledge that they are a people the Lord has blessed.”
23061010 I delight greatly in the Lord; my soul rejoices in my God. For he has clothed me with garments of salvation and arrayed me in a robe of his righteousness, as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
23061011 For as the soil makes the sprout come up and a garden causes seeds to grow, so the Sovereign Lord will make righteousness and praise spring up before all nations.
23062001 For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent, for Jerusalem’s sake I will not remain quiet, till her vindication shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch.
23062002 The nations will see your vindication, and all kings your glory; you will be called by a new name that the mouth of the Lord will bestow.
23062003 You will be a crown of splendor in the Lord’s hand, a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
23062004 No longer will they call you Deserted, or name your land Desolate. But you will be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah ; for the Lord will take delight in you, and your land will be married.
23062005 As a young man marries a young woman, so will your Builder marry you; as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so will your God rejoice over you.
23062006 I have posted watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; they will never be silent day or night. You who call on the Lord, give yourselves no rest,
23062007 and give him no rest till he establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth.
23062008 The Lord has sworn by his right hand and by his mighty arm: “Never again will I give your grain as food for your enemies, and never again will foreigners drink the new wine for which you have toiled;
23062009 but those who harvest it will eat it and praise the Lord, and those who gather the grapes will drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.”
23062010 Pass through, pass through the gates! Prepare the way for the people. Build up, build up the highway! Remove the stones. Raise a banner for the nations.
23062011 The Lord has made proclamation to the ends of the earth: “Say to Daughter Zion, ‘See, your Savior comes! See, his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him.’ ”
23062012 They will be called the Holy People, the Redeemed of the Lord; and you will be called Sought After, the City No Longer Deserted.
23063001 Who is this coming from Edom, from Bozrah, with his garments stained crimson? Who is this, robed in splendor, striding forward in the greatness of his strength? “It is I, proclaiming victory, mighty to save.”
23063002 Why are your garments red, like those of one treading the winepress?
23063003 “I have trodden the winepress alone; from the nations no one was with me. I trampled them in my anger and trod them down in my wrath; their blood spattered my garments, and I stained all my clothing.
23063004 It was for me the day of vengeance; the year for me to redeem had come.
23063005 I looked, but there was no one to help, I was appalled that no one gave support; so my own arm achieved salvation for me, and my own wrath sustained me.
23063006 I trampled the nations in my anger; in my wrath I made them drunk and poured their blood on the ground.”
23063007 I will tell of the kindnesses of the Lord, the deeds for which he is to be praised, according to all the Lord has done for us— yes, the many good things he has done for Israel, according to his compassion and many kindnesses.
23063008 He said, “Surely they are my people, children who will be true to me”; and so he became their Savior.
23063009 In all their distress he too was distressed, and the angel of his presence saved them. In his love and mercy he redeemed them; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.
23063010 Yet they rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit. So he turned and became their enemy and he himself fought against them.
23063011 Then his people recalled the days of old, the days of Moses and his people— where is he who brought them through the sea, with the shepherd of his flock? Where is he who set his Holy Spirit among them,
23063012 who sent his glorious arm of power to be at Moses’ right hand, who divided the waters before them, to gain for himself everlasting renown,
23063013 who led them through the depths? Like a horse in open country, they did not stumble;
23063014 like cattle that go down to the plain, they were given rest by the Spirit of the Lord. This is how you guided your people to make for yourself a glorious name.
23063015 Look down from heaven and see, from your lofty throne, holy and glorious. Where are your zeal and your might? Your tenderness and compassion are withheld from us.
23063016 But you are our Father, though Abraham does not know us or Israel acknowledge us; you, Lord, are our Father, our Redeemer from of old is your name.
23063017 Why, Lord, do you make us wander from your ways and harden our hearts so we do not revere you? Return for the sake of your servants, the tribes that are your inheritance.
23063018 For a little while your people possessed your holy place, but now our enemies have trampled down your sanctuary.
23063019 We are yours from of old; but you have not ruled over them, they have not been called by your name.
23064001 Oh, that you would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains would tremble before you!
23064002 As when fire sets twigs ablaze and causes water to boil, come down to make your name known to your enemies and cause the nations to quake before you!
23064003 For when you did awesome things that we did not expect, you came down, and the mountains trembled before you.
23064004 Since ancient times no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen any God besides you, who acts on behalf of those who wait for him.
23064005 You come to the help of those who gladly do right, who remember your ways. But when we continued to sin against them, you were angry. How then can we be saved?
23064006 All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away.
23064007 No one calls on your name or strives to lay hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us and have given us over to our sins.
23064008 Yet you, Lord, are our Father. We are the clay, you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand.
23064009 Do not be angry beyond measure, Lord; do not remember our sins forever. Oh, look on us, we pray, for we are all your people.
23064010 Your sacred cities have become a wasteland; even Zion is a wasteland, Jerusalem a desolation.
23064011 Our holy and glorious temple, where our ancestors praised you, has been burned with fire, and all that we treasured lies in ruins.
23064012 After all this, Lord, will you hold yourself back? Will you keep silent and punish us beyond measure?
23065001 “I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me; I was found by those who did not seek me. To a nation that did not call on my name, I said, ‘Here am I, here am I.’
23065002 All day long I have held out my hands to an obstinate people, who walk in ways not good, pursuing their own imaginations—
23065003 a people who continually provoke me to my very face, offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on altars of brick;
23065004 who sit among the graves and spend their nights keeping secret vigil; who eat the flesh of pigs, and whose pots hold broth of impure meat;
23065005 who say, ‘Keep away; don’t come near me, for I am too sacred for you!’ Such people are smoke in my nostrils, a fire that keeps burning all day.
23065006 “See, it stands written before me: I will not keep silent but will pay back in full; I will pay it back into their laps—
23065007 both your sins and the sins of your ancestors,” says the Lord. “Because they burned sacrifices on the mountains and defied me on the hills, I will measure into their laps the full payment for their former deeds.”
23065008 This is what the Lord says: “As when juice is still found in a cluster of grapes and people say, ‘Don’t destroy it, there is still a blessing in it,’ so will I do in behalf of my servants; I will not destroy them all.
23065009 I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, and from Judah those who will possess my mountains; my chosen people will inherit them, and there will my servants live.
23065010 Sharon will become a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds, for my people who seek me.
23065011 “But as for you who forsake the Lord and forget my holy mountain, who spread a table for Fortune and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny,
23065012 I will destine you for the sword, and all of you will fall in the slaughter; for I called but you did not answer, I spoke but you did not listen. You did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me.”
23065013 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: “My servants will eat, but you will go hungry; my servants will drink, but you will go thirsty; my servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame.
23065014 My servants will sing out of the joy of their hearts, but you will cry out from anguish of heart and wail in brokenness of spirit.
23065015 You will leave your name for my chosen ones to use in their curses; the Sovereign Lord will put you to death, but to his servants he will give another name.
23065016 Whoever invokes a blessing in the land will do so by the one true God; whoever takes an oath in the land will swear by the one true God. For the past troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my eyes.
23065017 “See, I will create new heavens and a new earth. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind.
23065018 But be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create, for I will create Jerusalem to be a delight and its people a joy.
23065019 I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people; the sound of weeping and of crying will be heard in it no more.
23065020 “Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not live out his years; the one who dies at a hundred will be thought a mere child; the one who fails to reach a hundred will be considered accursed.
23065021 They will build houses and dwell in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
23065022 No longer will they build houses and others live in them, or plant and others eat. For as the days of a tree, so will be the days of my people; my chosen ones will long enjoy the work of their hands.
23065023 They will not labor in vain, nor will they bear children doomed to misfortune; for they will be a people blessed by the Lord, they and their descendants with them.
23065024 Before they call I will answer; while they are still speaking I will hear.
23065025 The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, and dust will be the serpent’s food. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain,” says the Lord.
23066001 This is what the Lord says: “Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. Where is the house you will build for me? Where will my resting place be?
23066002 Has not my hand made all these things, and so they came into being?” declares the Lord. “These are the ones I look on with favor: those who are humble and contrite in spirit, and who tremble at my word.
23066003 But whoever sacrifices a bull is like one who kills a person, and whoever offers a lamb is like one who breaks a dog’s neck; whoever makes a grain offering is like one who presents pig’s blood, and whoever burns memorial incense is like one who worships an idol. They have chosen their own ways, and they delight in their abominations;
23066004 so I also will choose harsh treatment for them and will bring on them what they dread. For when I called, no one answered, when I spoke, no one listened. They did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me.”
23066005 Hear the word of the Lord, you who tremble at his word: “Your own people who hate you, and exclude you because of my name, have said, ‘Let the Lord be glorified, that we may see your joy!’ Yet they will be put to shame.
23066006 Hear that uproar from the city, hear that noise from the temple! It is the sound of the Lord repaying his enemies all they deserve.
23066007 “Before she goes into labor, she gives birth; before the pains come upon her, she delivers a son.
23066008 Who has ever heard of such things? Who has ever seen things like this? Can a country be born in a day or a nation be brought forth in a moment? Yet no sooner is Zion in labor than she gives birth to her children.
23066009 Do I bring to the moment of birth and not give delivery?” says the Lord. “Do I close up the womb when I bring to delivery?” says your God.
23066010 “Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all you who love her; rejoice greatly with her, all you who mourn over her.
23066011 For you will nurse and be satisfied at her comforting breasts; you will drink deeply and delight in her overflowing abundance.”
23066012 For this is what the Lord says: “I will extend peace to her like a river, and the wealth of nations like a flooding stream; you will nurse and be carried on her arm and dandled on her knees.
23066013 As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you; and you will be comforted over Jerusalem.”
23066014 When you see this, your heart will rejoice and you will flourish like grass; the hand of the Lord will be made known to his servants, but his fury will be shown to his foes.
23066015 See, the Lord is coming with fire, and his chariots are like a whirlwind; he will bring down his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
23066016 For with fire and with his sword the Lord will execute judgment on all people, and many will be those slain by the Lord.
23066017 “Those who consecrate and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one who is among those who eat the flesh of pigs, rats and other unclean things—they will meet their end together with the one they follow,” declares the Lord.
23066018 “And I, because of what they have planned and done, am about to come and gather the people of all nations and languages, and they will come and see my glory.
23066019 “I will set a sign among them, and I will send some of those who survive to the nations—to Tarshish, to the Libyans and Lydians (famous as archers), to Tubal and Greece, and to the distant islands that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory. They will proclaim my glory among the nations.
23066020 And they will bring all your people, from all the nations, to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the Lord—on horses, in chariots and wagons, and on mules and camels,” says the Lord. “They will bring them, as the Israelites bring their grain offerings, to the temple of the Lord in ceremonially clean vessels.
23066021 And I will select some of them also to be priests and Levites,” says the Lord.
23066022 “As the new heavens and the new earth that I make will endure before me,” declares the Lord, “so will your name and descendants endure.
23066023 From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me,” says the Lord.
23066024 “And they will go out and look on the dead bodies of those who rebelled against me; the worms that eat them will not die, the fire that burns them will not be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind.”
24001001 The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin.
24001002 The word of the Lord came to him in the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah,
24001003 and through the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, down to the fifth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, when the people of Jerusalem went into exile.
24001004 The word of the Lord came to me, saying,
24001005 “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.”
24001006 “Alas, Sovereign Lord,” I said, “I do not know how to speak; I am too young.”
24001007 But the Lord said to me, “Do not say, ‘I am too young.’ You must go to everyone I send you to and say whatever I command you.
24001008 Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you and will rescue you,” declares the Lord.
24001009 Then the Lord reached out his hand and touched my mouth and said to me, “I have put my words in your mouth.
24001010 See, today I appoint you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant.”
24001011 The word of the Lord came to me: “What do you see, Jeremiah?” “I see the branch of an almond tree,” I replied.
24001012 The Lord said to me, “You have seen correctly, for I am watching to see that my word is fulfilled.”
24001013 The word of the Lord came to me again: “What do you see?” “I see a pot that is boiling,” I answered. “It is tilting toward us from the north.”
24001014 The Lord said to me, “From the north disaster will be poured out on all who live in the land.
24001015 I am about to summon all the peoples of the northern kingdoms,” declares the Lord. “Their kings will come and set up their thrones in the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem; they will come against all her surrounding walls and against all the towns of Judah.
24001016 I will pronounce my judgments on my people because of their wickedness in forsaking me, in burning incense to other gods and in worshiping what their hands have made.
24001017 “Get yourself ready! Stand up and say to them whatever I command you. Do not be terrified by them, or I will terrify you before them.
24001018 Today I have made you a fortified city, an iron pillar and a bronze wall to stand against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests and the people of the land.
24001019 They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you and will rescue you,” declares the Lord.
24002001 The word of the Lord came to me:
24002002 “Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem: “This is what the Lord says: “ ‘I remember the devotion of your youth, how as a bride you loved me and followed me through the wilderness, through a land not sown.
24002003 Israel was holy to the Lord, the firstfruits of his harvest; all who devoured her were held guilty, and disaster overtook them,’ ” declares the Lord.
24002004 Hear the word of the Lord, you descendants of Jacob, all you clans of Israel.
24002005 This is what the Lord says: “What fault did your ancestors find in me, that they strayed so far from me? They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves.
24002006 They did not ask, ‘Where is the Lord, who brought us up out of Egypt and led us through the barren wilderness, through a land of deserts and ravines, a land of drought and utter darkness, a land where no one travels and no one lives?’
24002007 I brought you into a fertile land to eat its fruit and rich produce. But you came and defiled my land and made my inheritance detestable.
24002008 The priests did not ask, ‘Where is the Lord?’ Those who deal with the law did not know me; the leaders rebelled against me. The prophets prophesied by Baal, following worthless idols.
24002009 “Therefore I bring charges against you again,” declares the Lord. “And I will bring charges against your children’s children.
24002010 Cross over to the coasts of Cyprus and look, send to Kedar and observe closely; see if there has ever been anything like this:
24002011 Has a nation ever changed its gods? (Yet they are not gods at all.) But my people have exchanged their glorious God for worthless idols.
24002012 Be appalled at this, you heavens, and shudder with great horror,” declares the Lord.
24002013 “My people have committed two sins: They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water.
24002014 Is Israel a servant, a slave by birth? Why then has he become plunder?
24002015 Lions have roared; they have growled at him. They have laid waste his land; his towns are burned and deserted.
24002016 Also, the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes have cracked your skull.
24002017 Have you not brought this on yourselves by forsaking the Lord your God when he led you in the way?
24002018 Now why go to Egypt to drink water from the Nile ? And why go to Assyria to drink water from the Euphrates?
24002019 Your wickedness will punish you; your backsliding will rebuke you. Consider then and realize how evil and bitter it is for you when you forsake the Lord your God and have no awe of me,” declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty.
24002020 “Long ago you broke off your yoke and tore off your bonds; you said, ‘I will not serve you!’ Indeed, on every high hill and under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute.
24002021 I had planted you like a choice vine of sound and reliable stock. How then did you turn against me into a corrupt, wild vine?
24002022 Although you wash yourself with soap and use an abundance of cleansing powder, the stain of your guilt is still before me,” declares the Sovereign Lord.
24002023 “How can you say, ‘I am not defiled; I have not run after the Baals’? See how you behaved in the valley; consider what you have done. You are a swift she-camel running here and there,
24002024 a wild donkey accustomed to the desert, sniffing the wind in her craving— in her heat who can restrain her? Any males that pursue her need not tire themselves; at mating time they will find her.
24002025 Do not run until your feet are bare and your throat is dry. But you said, ‘It’s no use! I love foreign gods, and I must go after them.’
24002026 “As a thief is disgraced when he is caught, so the people of Israel are disgraced— they, their kings and their officials, their priests and their prophets.
24002027 They say to wood, ‘You are my father,’ and to stone, ‘You gave me birth.’ They have turned their backs to me and not their faces; yet when they are in trouble, they say, ‘Come and save us!’
24002028 Where then are the gods you made for yourselves? Let them come if they can save you when you are in trouble! For you, Judah, have as many gods as you have towns.
24002029 “Why do you bring charges against me? You have all rebelled against me,” declares the Lord.
24002030 “In vain I punished your people; they did not respond to correction. Your sword has devoured your prophets like a ravenous lion.
24002031 “You of this generation, consider the word of the Lord: “Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of great darkness? Why do my people say, ‘We are free to roam; we will come to you no more’?
24002032 Does a young woman forget her jewelry, a bride her wedding ornaments? Yet my people have forgotten me, days without number.
24002033 How skilled you are at pursuing love! Even the worst of women can learn from your ways.
24002034 On your clothes is found the lifeblood of the innocent poor, though you did not catch them breaking in. Yet in spite of all this
24002035 you say, ‘I am innocent; he is not angry with me.’ But I will pass judgment on you because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’
24002036 Why do you go about so much, changing your ways? You will be disappointed by Egypt as you were by Assyria.
24002037 You will also leave that place with your hands on your head, for the Lord has rejected those you trust; you will not be helped by them.
24003001 “If a man divorces his wife and she leaves him and marries another man, should he return to her again? Would not the land be completely defiled? But you have lived as a prostitute with many lovers— would you now return to me?” declares the Lord.
24003002 “Look up to the barren heights and see. Is there any place where you have not been ravished? By the roadside you sat waiting for lovers, sat like a nomad in the desert. You have defiled the land with your prostitution and wickedness.
24003003 Therefore the showers have been withheld, and no spring rains have fallen. Yet you have the brazen look of a prostitute; you refuse to blush with shame.
24003004 Have you not just called to me: ‘My Father, my friend from my youth,
24003005 will you always be angry? Will your wrath continue forever?’ This is how you talk, but you do all the evil you can.”
24003006 During the reign of King Josiah, the Lord said to me, “Have you seen what faithless Israel has done? She has gone up on every high hill and under every spreading tree and has committed adultery there.
24003007 I thought that after she had done all this she would return to me but she did not, and her unfaithful sister Judah saw it.
24003008 I gave faithless Israel her certificate of divorce and sent her away because of all her adulteries. Yet I saw that her unfaithful sister Judah had no fear; she also went out and committed adultery.
24003009 Because Israel’s immorality mattered so little to her, she defiled the land and committed adultery with stone and wood.
24003010 In spite of all this, her unfaithful sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart, but only in pretense,” declares the Lord.
24003011 The Lord said to me, “Faithless Israel is more righteous than unfaithful Judah.
24003012 Go, proclaim this message toward the north: “ ‘Return, faithless Israel,’ declares the Lord, ‘I will frown on you no longer, for I am faithful,’ declares the Lord, ‘I will not be angry forever.
24003013 Only acknowledge your guilt— you have rebelled against the Lord your God, you have scattered your favors to foreign gods under every spreading tree, and have not obeyed me,’ ” declares the Lord.
24003014 “Return, faithless people,” declares the Lord, “for I am your husband. I will choose you—one from a town and two from a clan—and bring you to Zion.
24003015 Then I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will lead you with knowledge and understanding.
24003016 In those days, when your numbers have increased greatly in the land,” declares the Lord, “people will no longer say, ‘The ark of the covenant of the Lord.’ It will never enter their minds or be remembered; it will not be missed, nor will another one be made.
24003017 At that time they will call Jerusalem The Throne of the Lord, and all nations will gather in Jerusalem to honor the name of the Lord. No longer will they follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts.
24003018 In those days the people of Judah will join the people of Israel, and together they will come from a northern land to the land I gave your ancestors as an inheritance.
24003019 “I myself said, “ ‘How gladly would I treat you like my children and give you a pleasant land, the most beautiful inheritance of any nation.’ I thought you would call me ‘Father’ and not turn away from following me.
24003020 But like a woman unfaithful to her husband, so you, Israel, have been unfaithful to me,” declares the Lord.
24003021 A cry is heard on the barren heights, the weeping and pleading of the people of Israel, because they have perverted their ways and have forgotten the Lord their God.
24003022 “Return, faithless people; I will cure you of backsliding.” “Yes, we will come to you, for you are the Lord our God.
24003023 Surely the idolatrous commotion on the hills and mountains is a deception; surely in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel.
24003024 From our youth shameful gods have consumed the fruits of our ancestors’ labor— their flocks and herds, their sons and daughters.
24003025 Let us lie down in our shame, and let our disgrace cover us. We have sinned against the Lord our God, both we and our ancestors; from our youth till this day we have not obeyed the Lord our God.”
24004001 “If you, Israel, will return, then return to me,” declares the Lord. “If you put your detestable idols out of my sight and no longer go astray,
24004002 and if in a truthful, just and righteous way you swear, ‘As surely as the Lord lives,’ then the nations will invoke blessings by him and in him they will boast.”
24004003 This is what the Lord says to the people of Judah and to Jerusalem: “Break up your unplowed ground and do not sow among thorns.
24004004 Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, circumcise your hearts, you people of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, or my wrath will flare up and burn like fire because of the evil you have done— burn with no one to quench it.
24004005 “Announce in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem and say: ‘Sound the trumpet throughout the land!’ Cry aloud and say: ‘Gather together! Let us flee to the fortified cities!’
24004006 Raise the signal to go to Zion! Flee for safety without delay! For I am bringing disaster from the north, even terrible destruction.”
24004007 A lion has come out of his lair; a destroyer of nations has set out. He has left his place to lay waste your land. Your towns will lie in ruins without inhabitant.
24004008 So put on sackcloth, lament and wail, for the fierce anger of the Lord has not turned away from us.
24004009 “In that day,” declares the Lord, “the king and the officials will lose heart, the priests will be horrified, and the prophets will be appalled.”
24004010 Then I said, “Alas, Sovereign Lord! How completely you have deceived this people and Jerusalem by saying, ‘You will have peace,’ when the sword is at our throats!”
24004011 At that time this people and Jerusalem will be told, “A scorching wind from the barren heights in the desert blows toward my people, but not to winnow or cleanse;
24004012 a wind too strong for that comes from me. Now I pronounce my judgments against them.”
24004013 Look! He advances like the clouds, his chariots come like a whirlwind, his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! We are ruined!
24004014 Jerusalem, wash the evil from your heart and be saved. How long will you harbor wicked thoughts?
24004015 A voice is announcing from Dan, proclaiming disaster from the hills of Ephraim.
24004016 “Tell this to the nations, proclaim concerning Jerusalem: ‘A besieging army is coming from a distant land, raising a war cry against the cities of Judah.
24004017 They surround her like men guarding a field, because she has rebelled against me,’ ” declares the Lord.
24004018 “Your own conduct and actions have brought this on you. This is your punishment. How bitter it is! How it pierces to the heart!”
24004019 Oh, my anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain. Oh, the agony of my heart! My heart pounds within me, I cannot keep silent. For I have heard the sound of the trumpet; I have heard the battle cry.
24004020 Disaster follows disaster; the whole land lies in ruins. In an instant my tents are destroyed, my shelter in a moment.
24004021 How long must I see the battle standard and hear the sound of the trumpet?
24004022 “My people are fools; they do not know me. They are senseless children; they have no understanding. They are skilled in doing evil; they know not how to do good.”
24004023 I looked at the earth, and it was formless and empty; and at the heavens, and their light was gone.
24004024 I looked at the mountains, and they were quaking; all the hills were swaying.
24004025 I looked, and there were no people; every bird in the sky had flown away.
24004026 I looked, and the fruitful land was a desert; all its towns lay in ruins before the Lord, before his fierce anger.
24004027 This is what the Lord says: “The whole land will be ruined, though I will not destroy it completely.
24004028 Therefore the earth will mourn and the heavens above grow dark, because I have spoken and will not relent, I have decided and will not turn back.”
24004029 At the sound of horsemen and archers every town takes to flight. Some go into the thickets; some climb up among the rocks. All the towns are deserted; no one lives in them.
24004030 What are you doing, you devastated one? Why dress yourself in scarlet and put on jewels of gold? Why highlight your eyes with makeup? You adorn yourself in vain. Your lovers despise you; they want to kill you.
24004031 I hear a cry as of a woman in labor, a groan as of one bearing her first child— the cry of Daughter Zion gasping for breath, stretching out her hands and saying, “Alas! I am fainting; my life is given over to murderers.”
24005001 “Go up and down the streets of Jerusalem, look around and consider, search through her squares. If you can find but one person who deals honestly and seeks the truth, I will forgive this city.
24005002 Although they say, ‘As surely as the Lord lives,’ still they are swearing falsely.”
24005003 Lord, do not your eyes look for truth? You struck them, but they felt no pain; you crushed them, but they refused correction. They made their faces harder than stone and refused to repent.
24005004 I thought, “These are only the poor; they are foolish, for they do not know the way of the Lord, the requirements of their God.
24005005 So I will go to the leaders and speak to them; surely they know the way of the Lord, the requirements of their God.” But with one accord they too had broken off the yoke and torn off the bonds.
24005006 Therefore a lion from the forest will attack them, a wolf from the desert will ravage them, a leopard will lie in wait near their towns to tear to pieces any who venture out, for their rebellion is great and their backslidings many.
24005007 “Why should I forgive you? Your children have forsaken me and sworn by gods that are not gods. I supplied all their needs, yet they committed adultery and thronged to the houses of prostitutes.
24005008 They are well-fed, lusty stallions, each neighing for another man’s wife.
24005009 Should I not punish them for this?” declares the Lord. “Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this?
24005010 “Go through her vineyards and ravage them, but do not destroy them completely. Strip off her branches, for these people do not belong to the Lord.
24005011 The people of Israel and the people of Judah have been utterly unfaithful to me,” declares the Lord.
24005012 They have lied about the Lord; they said, “He will do nothing! No harm will come to us; we will never see sword or famine.
24005013 The prophets are but wind and the word is not in them; so let what they say be done to them.”
24005014 Therefore this is what the Lord God Almighty says: “Because the people have spoken these words, I will make my words in your mouth a fire and these people the wood it consumes.
24005015 People of Israel,” declares the Lord, “I am bringing a distant nation against you— an ancient and enduring nation, a people whose language you do not know, whose speech you do not understand.
24005016 Their quivers are like an open grave; all of them are mighty warriors.
24005017 They will devour your harvests and food, devour your sons and daughters; they will devour your flocks and herds, devour your vines and fig trees. With the sword they will destroy the fortified cities in which you trust.
24005018 “Yet even in those days,” declares the Lord, “I will not destroy you completely.
24005019 And when the people ask, ‘Why has the Lord our God done all this to us?’ you will tell them, ‘As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your own land, so now you will serve foreigners in a land not your own.’
24005020 “Announce this to the descendants of Jacob and proclaim it in Judah:
24005021 Hear this, you foolish and senseless people, who have eyes but do not see, who have ears but do not hear:
24005022 Should you not fear me?” declares the Lord. “Should you not tremble in my presence? I made the sand a boundary for the sea, an everlasting barrier it cannot cross. The waves may roll, but they cannot prevail; they may roar, but they cannot cross it.
24005023 But these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts; they have turned aside and gone away.
24005024 They do not say to themselves, ‘Let us fear the Lord our God, who gives autumn and spring rains in season, who assures us of the regular weeks of harvest.’
24005025 Your wrongdoings have kept these away; your sins have deprived you of good.
24005026 “Among my people are the wicked who lie in wait like men who snare birds and like those who set traps to catch people.
24005027 Like cages full of birds, their houses are full of deceit; they have become rich and powerful
24005028 and have grown fat and sleek. Their evil deeds have no limit; they do not seek justice. They do not promote the case of the fatherless; they do not defend the just cause of the poor.
24005029 Should I not punish them for this?” declares the Lord. “Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this?
24005030 “A horrible and shocking thing has happened in the land:
24005031 The prophets prophesy lies, the priests rule by their own authority, and my people love it this way. But what will you do in the end?
24006001 “Flee for safety, people of Benjamin! Flee from Jerusalem! Sound the trumpet in Tekoa! Raise the signal over Beth Hakkerem! For disaster looms out of the north, even terrible destruction.
24006002 I will destroy Daughter Zion, so beautiful and delicate.
24006003 Shepherds with their flocks will come against her; they will pitch their tents around her, each tending his own portion.”
24006004 “Prepare for battle against her! Arise, let us attack at noon! But, alas, the daylight is fading, and the shadows of evening grow long.
24006005 So arise, let us attack at night and destroy her fortresses!”
24006006 This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Cut down the trees and build siege ramps against Jerusalem. This city must be punished; it is filled with oppression.
24006007 As a well pours out its water, so she pours out her wickedness. Violence and destruction resound in her; her sickness and wounds are ever before me.
24006008 Take warning, Jerusalem, or I will turn away from you and make your land desolate so no one can live in it.”
24006009 This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Let them glean the remnant of Israel as thoroughly as a vine; pass your hand over the branches again, like one gathering grapes.”
24006010 To whom can I speak and give warning? Who will listen to me? Their ears are closed so they cannot hear. The word of the Lord is offensive to them; they find no pleasure in it.
24006011 But I am full of the wrath of the Lord, and I cannot hold it in. “Pour it out on the children in the street and on the young men gathered together; both husband and wife will be caught in it, and the old, those weighed down with years.
24006012 Their houses will be turned over to others, together with their fields and their wives, when I stretch out my hand against those who live in the land,” declares the Lord.
24006013 “From the least to the greatest, all are greedy for gain; prophets and priests alike, all practice deceit.
24006014 They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious. ‘Peace, peace,’ they say, when there is no peace.
24006015 Are they ashamed of their detestable conduct? No, they have no shame at all; they do not even know how to blush. So they will fall among the fallen; they will be brought down when I punish them,” says the Lord.
24006016 This is what the Lord says: “Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths, ask where the good way is, and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls. But you said, ‘We will not walk in it.’
24006017 I appointed watchmen over you and said, ‘Listen to the sound of the trumpet!’ But you said, ‘We will not listen.’
24006018 Therefore hear, you nations; you who are witnesses, observe what will happen to them.
24006019 Hear, you earth: I am bringing disaster on this people, the fruit of their schemes, because they have not listened to my words and have rejected my law.
24006020 What do I care about incense from Sheba or sweet calamus from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable; your sacrifices do not please me.”
24006021 Therefore this is what the Lord says: “I will put obstacles before this people. Parents and children alike will stumble over them; neighbors and friends will perish.”
24006022 This is what the Lord says: “Look, an army is coming from the land of the north; a great nation is being stirred up from the ends of the earth.
24006023 They are armed with bow and spear; they are cruel and show no mercy. They sound like the roaring sea as they ride on their horses; they come like men in battle formation to attack you, Daughter Zion.”
24006024 We have heard reports about them, and our hands hang limp. Anguish has gripped us, pain like that of a woman in labor.
24006025 Do not go out to the fields or walk on the roads, for the enemy has a sword, and there is terror on every side.
24006026 Put on sackcloth, my people, and roll in ashes; mourn with bitter wailing as for an only son, for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us.
24006027 “I have made you a tester of metals and my people the ore, that you may observe and test their ways.
24006028 They are all hardened rebels, going about to slander. They are bronze and iron; they all act corruptly.
24006029 The bellows blow fiercely to burn away the lead with fire, but the refining goes on in vain; the wicked are not purged out.
24006030 They are called rejected silver, because the Lord has rejected them.”
24007001 This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
24007002 “Stand at the gate of the Lord’s house and there proclaim this message: “ ‘Hear the word of the Lord, all you people of Judah who come through these gates to worship the Lord.
24007003 This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Reform your ways and your actions, and I will let you live in this place.
24007004 Do not trust in deceptive words and say, “This is the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord!”
24007005 If you really change your ways and your actions and deal with each other justly,
24007006 if you do not oppress the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow and do not shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not follow other gods to your own harm,
24007007 then I will let you live in this place, in the land I gave your ancestors for ever and ever.
24007008 But look, you are trusting in deceptive words that are worthless.
24007009 “ ‘Will you steal and murder, commit adultery and perjury, burn incense to Baal and follow other gods you have not known,
24007010 and then come and stand before me in this house, which bears my Name, and say, “We are safe”—safe to do all these detestable things?
24007011 Has this house, which bears my Name, become a den of robbers to you? But I have been watching! declares the Lord.
24007012 “ ‘Go now to the place in Shiloh where I first made a dwelling for my Name, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel.
24007013 While you were doing all these things, declares the Lord, I spoke to you again and again, but you did not listen; I called you, but you did not answer.
24007014 Therefore, what I did to Shiloh I will now do to the house that bears my Name, the temple you trust in, the place I gave to you and your ancestors.
24007015 I will thrust you from my presence, just as I did all your fellow Israelites, the people of Ephraim.’
24007016 “So do not pray for this people nor offer any plea or petition for them; do not plead with me, for I will not listen to you.
24007017 Do you not see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
24007018 The children gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead the dough and make cakes to offer to the Queen of Heaven. They pour out drink offerings to other gods to arouse my anger.
24007019 But am I the one they are provoking? declares the Lord. Are they not rather harming themselves, to their own shame?
24007020 “ ‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: My anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place—on man and beast, on the trees of the field and on the crops of your land—and it will burn and not be quenched.
24007021 “ ‘This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go ahead, add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and eat the meat yourselves!
24007022 For when I brought your ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I did not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices,
24007023 but I gave them this command: Obey me, and I will be your God and you will be my people. Walk in obedience to all I command you, that it may go well with you.
24007024 But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubborn inclinations of their evil hearts. They went backward and not forward.
24007025 From the time your ancestors left Egypt until now, day after day, again and again I sent you my servants the prophets.
24007026 But they did not listen to me or pay attention. They were stiff-necked and did more evil than their ancestors.’
24007027 “When you tell them all this, they will not listen to you; when you call to them, they will not answer.
24007028 Therefore say to them, ‘This is the nation that has not obeyed the Lord its God or responded to correction. Truth has perished; it has vanished from their lips.
24007029 “ ‘Cut off your hair and throw it away; take up a lament on the barren heights, for the Lord has rejected and abandoned this generation that is under his wrath.
24007030 “ ‘The people of Judah have done evil in my eyes, declares the Lord. They have set up their detestable idols in the house that bears my Name and have defiled it.
24007031 They have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to burn their sons and daughters in the fire—something I did not command, nor did it enter my mind.
24007032 So beware, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when people will no longer call it Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter, for they will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room.
24007033 Then the carcasses of this people will become food for the birds and the wild animals, and there will be no one to frighten them away.
24007034 I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, for the land will become desolate.
24008001 “ ‘At that time, declares the Lord, the bones of the kings and officials of Judah, the bones of the priests and prophets, and the bones of the people of Jerusalem will be removed from their graves.
24008002 They will be exposed to the sun and the moon and all the stars of the heavens, which they have loved and served and which they have followed and consulted and worshiped. They will not be gathered up or buried, but will be like dung lying on the ground.
24008003 Wherever I banish them, all the survivors of this evil nation will prefer death to life, declares the Lord Almighty.’
24008004 “Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord says: “ ‘When people fall down, do they not get up? When someone turns away, do they not return?
24008005 Why then have these people turned away? Why does Jerusalem always turn away? They cling to deceit; they refuse to return.
24008006 I have listened attentively, but they do not say what is right. None of them repent of their wickedness, saying, “What have I done?” Each pursues their own course like a horse charging into battle.
24008007 Even the stork in the sky knows her appointed seasons, and the dove, the swift and the thrush observe the time of their migration. But my people do not know the requirements of the Lord.
24008008 “ ‘How can you say, “We are wise, for we have the law of the Lord,” when actually the lying pen of the scribes has handled it falsely?
24008009 The wise will be put to shame; they will be dismayed and trapped. Since they have rejected the word of the Lord, what kind of wisdom do they have?
24008010 Therefore I will give their wives to other men and their fields to new owners. From the least to the greatest, all are greedy for gain; prophets and priests alike, all practice deceit.
24008011 They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious. “Peace, peace,” they say, when there is no peace.
24008012 Are they ashamed of their detestable conduct? No, they have no shame at all; they do not even know how to blush. So they will fall among the fallen; they will be brought down when they are punished, says the Lord.
24008013 “ ‘I will take away their harvest, declares the Lord. There will be no grapes on the vine. There will be no figs on the tree, and their leaves will wither. What I have given them will be taken from them. ’ ”
24008014 Why are we sitting here? Gather together! Let us flee to the fortified cities and perish there! For the Lord our God has doomed us to perish and given us poisoned water to drink, because we have sinned against him.
24008015 We hoped for peace but no good has come, for a time of healing but there is only terror.
24008016 The snorting of the enemy’s horses is heard from Dan; at the neighing of their stallions the whole land trembles. They have come to devour the land and everything in it, the city and all who live there.
24008017 “See, I will send venomous snakes among you, vipers that cannot be charmed, and they will bite you,” declares the Lord.
24008018 You who are my Comforter in sorrow, my heart is faint within me.
24008019 Listen to the cry of my people from a land far away: “Is the Lord not in Zion? Is her King no longer there?” “Why have they aroused my anger with their images, with their worthless foreign idols?”
24008020 “The harvest is past, the summer has ended, and we are not saved.”
24008021 Since my people are crushed, I am crushed; I mourn, and horror grips me.
24008022 Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is there no healing for the wound of my people?
24009001 Oh, that my head were a spring of water and my eyes a fountain of tears! I would weep day and night for the slain of my people.
24009002 Oh, that I had in the desert a lodging place for travelers, so that I might leave my people and go away from them; for they are all adulterers, a crowd of unfaithful people.
24009003 “They make ready their tongue like a bow, to shoot lies; it is not by truth that they triumph in the land. They go from one sin to another; they do not acknowledge me,” declares the Lord.
24009004 “Beware of your friends; do not trust anyone in your clan. For every one of them is a deceiver, and every friend a slanderer.
24009005 Friend deceives friend, and no one speaks the truth. They have taught their tongues to lie; they weary themselves with sinning.
24009006 You live in the midst of deception; in their deceit they refuse to acknowledge me,” declares the Lord.
24009007 Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty says: “See, I will refine and test them, for what else can I do because of the sin of my people?
24009008 Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceitfully. With their mouths they all speak cordially to their neighbors, but in their hearts they set traps for them.
24009009 Should I not punish them for this?” declares the Lord. “Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this?”
24009010 I will weep and wail for the mountains and take up a lament concerning the wilderness grasslands. They are desolate and untraveled, and the lowing of cattle is not heard. The birds have all fled and the animals are gone.
24009011 “I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals; and I will lay waste the towns of Judah so no one can live there.”
24009012 Who is wise enough to understand this? Who has been instructed by the Lord and can explain it? Why has the land been ruined and laid waste like a desert that no one can cross?
24009013 The Lord said, “It is because they have forsaken my law, which I set before them; they have not obeyed me or followed my law.
24009014 Instead, they have followed the stubbornness of their hearts; they have followed the Baals, as their ancestors taught them.”
24009015 Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “See, I will make this people eat bitter food and drink poisoned water.
24009016 I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors have known, and I will pursue them with the sword until I have made an end of them.”
24009017 This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Consider now! Call for the wailing women to come; send for the most skillful of them.
24009018 Let them come quickly and wail over us till our eyes overflow with tears and water streams from our eyelids.
24009019 The sound of wailing is heard from Zion: ‘How ruined we are! How great is our shame! We must leave our land because our houses are in ruins.’ ”
24009020 Now, you women, hear the word of the Lord; open your ears to the words of his mouth. Teach your daughters how to wail; teach one another a lament.
24009021 Death has climbed in through our windows and has entered our fortresses; it has removed the children from the streets and the young men from the public squares.
24009022 Say, “This is what the Lord declares: “ ‘Dead bodies will lie like dung on the open field, like cut grain behind the reaper, with no one to gather them.’ ”
24009023 This is what the Lord says: “Let not the wise boast of their wisdom or the strong boast of their strength or the rich boast of their riches,
24009024 but let the one who boasts boast about this: that they have the understanding to know me, that I am the Lord, who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on earth, for in these I delight,” declares the Lord.
24009025 “The days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh—
24009026 Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab and all who live in the wilderness in distant places. For all these nations are really uncircumcised, and even the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.”
24010001 Hear what the Lord says to you, people of Israel.
24010002 This is what the Lord says: “Do not learn the ways of the nations or be terrified by signs in the heavens, though the nations are terrified by them.
24010003 For the practices of the peoples are worthless; they cut a tree out of the forest, and a craftsman shapes it with his chisel.
24010004 They adorn it with silver and gold; they fasten it with hammer and nails so it will not totter.
24010005 Like a scarecrow in a cucumber field, their idols cannot speak; they must be carried because they cannot walk. Do not fear them; they can do no harm nor can they do any good.”
24010006 No one is like you, Lord; you are great, and your name is mighty in power.
24010007 Who should not fear you, King of the nations? This is your due. Among all the wise leaders of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is no one like you.
24010008 They are all senseless and foolish; they are taught by worthless wooden idols.
24010009 Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz. What the craftsman and goldsmith have made is then dressed in blue and purple— all made by skilled workers.
24010010 But the Lord is the true God; he is the living God, the eternal King. When he is angry, the earth trembles; the nations cannot endure his wrath.
24010011 “Tell them this: ‘These gods, who did not make the heavens and the earth, will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.’ ”
24010012 But God made the earth by his power; he founded the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding.
24010013 When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar; he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses.
24010014 Everyone is senseless and without knowledge; every goldsmith is shamed by his idols. The images he makes are a fraud; they have no breath in them.
24010015 They are worthless, the objects of mockery; when their judgment comes, they will perish.
24010016 He who is the Portion of Jacob is not like these, for he is the Maker of all things, including Israel, the people of his inheritance— the Lord Almighty is his name.
24010017 Gather up your belongings to leave the land, you who live under siege.
24010018 For this is what the Lord says: “At this time I will hurl out those who live in this land; I will bring distress on them so that they may be captured.”
24010019 Woe to me because of my injury! My wound is incurable! Yet I said to myself, “This is my sickness, and I must endure it.”
24010020 My tent is destroyed; all its ropes are snapped. My children are gone from me and are no more; no one is left now to pitch my tent or to set up my shelter.
24010021 The shepherds are senseless and do not inquire of the Lord; so they do not prosper and all their flock is scattered.
24010022 Listen! The report is coming— a great commotion from the land of the north! It will make the towns of Judah desolate, a haunt of jackals.
24010023 Lord, I know that people’s lives are not their own; it is not for them to direct their steps.
24010024 Discipline me, Lord, but only in due measure— not in your anger, or you will reduce me to nothing.
24010025 Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the peoples who do not call on your name. For they have devoured Jacob; they have devoured him completely and destroyed his homeland.
24011001 This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
24011002 “Listen to the terms of this covenant and tell them to the people of Judah and to those who live in Jerusalem.
24011003 Tell them that this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘Cursed is the one who does not obey the terms of this covenant—
24011004 the terms I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the iron-smelting furnace.’ I said, ‘Obey me and do everything I command you, and you will be my people, and I will be your God.
24011005 Then I will fulfill the oath I swore to your ancestors, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey’—the land you possess today.” I answered, “Amen, Lord.”
24011006 The Lord said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: ‘Listen to the terms of this covenant and follow them.
24011007 From the time I brought your ancestors up from Egypt until today, I warned them again and again, saying, “Obey me.”
24011008 But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubbornness of their evil hearts. So I brought on them all the curses of the covenant I had commanded them to follow but that they did not keep.’ ”
24011009 Then the Lord said to me, “There is a conspiracy among the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem.
24011010 They have returned to the sins of their ancestors, who refused to listen to my words. They have followed other gods to serve them. Both Israel and Judah have broken the covenant I made with their ancestors.
24011011 Therefore this is what the Lord says: ‘I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them.
24011012 The towns of Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they will not help them at all when disaster strikes.
24011013 You, Judah, have as many gods as you have towns; and the altars you have set up to burn incense to that shameful god Baal are as many as the streets of Jerusalem.’
24011014 “Do not pray for this people or offer any plea or petition for them, because I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their distress.
24011015 “What is my beloved doing in my temple as she, with many others, works out her evil schemes? Can consecrated meat avert your punishment? When you engage in your wickedness, then you rejoice. ”
24011016 The Lord called you a thriving olive tree with fruit beautiful in form. But with the roar of a mighty storm he will set it on fire, and its branches will be broken.
24011017 The Lord Almighty, who planted you, has decreed disaster for you, because the people of both Israel and Judah have done evil and aroused my anger by burning incense to Baal.
24011018 Because the Lord revealed their plot to me, I knew it, for at that time he showed me what they were doing.
24011019 I had been like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter; I did not realize that they had plotted against me, saying, “Let us destroy the tree and its fruit; let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name be remembered no more.”
24011020 But you, Lord Almighty, who judge righteously and test the heart and mind, let me see your vengeance on them, for to you I have committed my cause.
24011021 Therefore this is what the Lord says about the people of Anathoth who are threatening to kill you, saying, “Do not prophesy in the name of the Lord or you will die by our hands”—
24011022 therefore this is what the Lord Almighty says: “I will punish them. Their young men will die by the sword, their sons and daughters by famine.
24011023 Not even a remnant will be left to them, because I will bring disaster on the people of Anathoth in the year of their punishment.”
24012001 You are always righteous, Lord, when I bring a case before you. Yet I would speak with you about your justice: Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why do all the faithless live at ease?
24012002 You have planted them, and they have taken root; they grow and bear fruit. You are always on their lips but far from their hearts.
24012003 Yet you know me, Lord; you see me and test my thoughts about you. Drag them off like sheep to be butchered! Set them apart for the day of slaughter!
24012004 How long will the land lie parched and the grass in every field be withered? Because those who live in it are wicked, the animals and birds have perished. Moreover, the people are saying, “He will not see what happens to us.”
24012005 “If you have raced with men on foot and they have worn you out, how can you compete with horses? If you stumble in safe country, how will you manage in the thickets by the Jordan?
24012006 Your relatives, members of your own family— even they have betrayed you; they have raised a loud cry against you. Do not trust them, though they speak well of you.
24012007 “I will forsake my house, abandon my inheritance; I will give the one I love into the hands of her enemies.
24012008 My inheritance has become to me like a lion in the forest. She roars at me; therefore I hate her.
24012009 Has not my inheritance become to me like a speckled bird of prey that other birds of prey surround and attack? Go and gather all the wild beasts; bring them to devour.
24012010 Many shepherds will ruin my vineyard and trample down my field; they will turn my pleasant field into a desolate wasteland.
24012011 It will be made a wasteland, parched and desolate before me; the whole land will be laid waste because there is no one who cares.
24012012 Over all the barren heights in the desert destroyers will swarm, for the sword of the Lord will devour from one end of the land to the other; no one will be safe.
24012013 They will sow wheat but reap thorns; they will wear themselves out but gain nothing. They will bear the shame of their harvest because of the Lord’s fierce anger.”
24012014 This is what the Lord says: “As for all my wicked neighbors who seize the inheritance I gave my people Israel, I will uproot them from their lands and I will uproot the people of Judah from among them.
24012015 But after I uproot them, I will again have compassion and will bring each of them back to their own inheritance and their own country.
24012016 And if they learn well the ways of my people and swear by my name, saying, ‘As surely as the Lord lives’—even as they once taught my people to swear by Baal—then they will be established among my people.
24012017 But if any nation does not listen, I will completely uproot and destroy it,” declares the Lord.
24013001 This is what the Lord said to me: “Go and buy a linen belt and put it around your waist, but do not let it touch water.”
24013002 So I bought a belt, as the Lord directed, and put it around my waist.
24013003 Then the word of the Lord came to me a second time:
24013004 “Take the belt you bought and are wearing around your waist, and go now to Perath and hide it there in a crevice in the rocks.”
24013005 So I went and hid it at Perath, as the Lord told me.
24013006 Many days later the Lord said to me, “Go now to Perath and get the belt I told you to hide there.”
24013007 So I went to Perath and dug up the belt and took it from the place where I had hidden it, but now it was ruined and completely useless.
24013008 Then the word of the Lord came to me:
24013009 “This is what the Lord says: ‘In the same way I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
24013010 These wicked people, who refuse to listen to my words, who follow the stubbornness of their hearts and go after other gods to serve and worship them, will be like this belt—completely useless!
24013011 For as a belt is bound around the waist, so I bound all the people of Israel and all the people of Judah to me,’ declares the Lord, ‘to be my people for my renown and praise and honor. But they have not listened.’
24013012 “Say to them: ‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Every wineskin should be filled with wine.’ And if they say to you, ‘Don’t we know that every wineskin should be filled with wine?’
24013013 then tell them, ‘This is what the Lord says: I am going to fill with drunkenness all who live in this land, including the kings who sit on David’s throne, the priests, the prophets and all those living in Jerusalem.
24013014 I will smash them one against the other, parents and children alike, declares the Lord. I will allow no pity or mercy or compassion to keep me from destroying them.’ ”
24013015 Hear and pay attention, do not be arrogant, for the Lord has spoken.
24013016 Give glory to the Lord your God before he brings the darkness, before your feet stumble on the darkening hills. You hope for light, but he will turn it to utter darkness and change it to deep gloom.
24013017 If you do not listen, I will weep in secret because of your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly, overflowing with tears, because the Lord’s flock will be taken captive.
24013018 Say to the king and to the queen mother, “Come down from your thrones, for your glorious crowns will fall from your heads.”
24013019 The cities in the Negev will be shut up, and there will be no one to open them. All Judah will be carried into exile, carried completely away.
24013020 Look up and see those who are coming from the north. Where is the flock that was entrusted to you, the sheep of which you boasted?
24013021 What will you say when the Lord sets over you those you cultivated as your special allies? Will not pain grip you like that of a woman in labor?
24013022 And if you ask yourself, “Why has this happened to me?”— it is because of your many sins that your skirts have been torn off and your body mistreated.
24013023 Can an Ethiopian change his skin or a leopard its spots? Neither can you do good who are accustomed to doing evil.
24013024 “I will scatter you like chaff driven by the desert wind.
24013025 This is your lot, the portion I have decreed for you,” declares the Lord, “because you have forgotten me and trusted in false gods.
24013026 I will pull up your skirts over your face that your shame may be seen—
24013027 your adulteries and lustful neighings, your shameless prostitution! I have seen your detestable acts on the hills and in the fields. Woe to you, Jerusalem! How long will you be unclean?”
24014001 This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:
24014002 “Judah mourns, her cities languish; they wail for the land, and a cry goes up from Jerusalem.
24014003 The nobles send their servants for water; they go to the cisterns but find no water. They return with their jars unfilled; dismayed and despairing, they cover their heads.
24014004 The ground is cracked because there is no rain in the land; the farmers are dismayed and cover their heads.
24014005 Even the doe in the field deserts her newborn fawn because there is no grass.
24014006 Wild donkeys stand on the barren heights and pant like jackals; their eyes fail for lack of food.”
24014007 Although our sins testify against us, do something, Lord, for the sake of your name. For we have often rebelled; we have sinned against you.
24014008 You who are the hope of Israel, its Savior in times of distress, why are you like a stranger in the land, like a traveler who stays only a night?
24014009 Why are you like a man taken by surprise, like a warrior powerless to save? You are among us, Lord, and we bear your name; do not forsake us!
24014010 This is what the Lord says about this people: “They greatly love to wander; they do not restrain their feet. So the Lord does not accept them; he will now remember their wickedness and punish them for their sins.”
24014011 Then the Lord said to me, “Do not pray for the well-being of this people.
24014012 Although they fast, I will not listen to their cry; though they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them. Instead, I will destroy them with the sword, famine and plague.”
24014013 But I said, “Alas, Sovereign Lord! The prophets keep telling them, ‘You will not see the sword or suffer famine. Indeed, I will give you lasting peace in this place.’ ”
24014014 Then the Lord said to me, “The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. I have not sent them or appointed them or spoken to them. They are prophesying to you false visions, divinations, idolatries and the delusions of their own minds.
24014015 Therefore this is what the Lord says about the prophets who are prophesying in my name: I did not send them, yet they are saying, ‘No sword or famine will touch this land.’ Those same prophets will perish by sword and famine.
24014016 And the people they are prophesying to will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and sword. There will be no one to bury them, their wives, their sons and their daughters. I will pour out on them the calamity they deserve.
24014017 “Speak this word to them: “ ‘Let my eyes overflow with tears night and day without ceasing; for the Virgin Daughter, my people, has suffered a grievous wound, a crushing blow.
24014018 If I go into the country, I see those slain by the sword; if I go into the city, I see the ravages of famine. Both prophet and priest have gone to a land they know not.’ ”
24014019 Have you rejected Judah completely? Do you despise Zion? Why have you afflicted us so that we cannot be healed? We hoped for peace but no good has come, for a time of healing but there is only terror.
24014020 We acknowledge our wickedness, Lord, and the guilt of our ancestors; we have indeed sinned against you.
24014021 For the sake of your name do not despise us; do not dishonor your glorious throne. Remember your covenant with us and do not break it.
24014022 Do any of the worthless idols of the nations bring rain? Do the skies themselves send down showers? No, it is you, Lord our God. Therefore our hope is in you, for you are the one who does all this.
24015001 Then the Lord said to me: “Even if Moses and Samuel were to stand before me, my heart would not go out to this people. Send them away from my presence! Let them go!
24015002 And if they ask you, ‘Where shall we go?’ tell them, ‘This is what the Lord says: “ ‘Those destined for death, to death; those for the sword, to the sword; those for starvation, to starvation; those for captivity, to captivity.’
24015003 “I will send four kinds of destroyers against them,” declares the Lord, “the sword to kill and the dogs to drag away and the birds and the wild animals to devour and destroy.
24015004 I will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah did in Jerusalem.
24015005 “Who will have pity on you, Jerusalem? Who will mourn for you? Who will stop to ask how you are?
24015006 You have rejected me,” declares the Lord. “You keep on backsliding. So I will reach out and destroy you; I am tired of holding back.
24015007 I will winnow them with a winnowing fork at the city gates of the land. I will bring bereavement and destruction on my people, for they have not changed their ways.
24015008 I will make their widows more numerous than the sand of the sea. At midday I will bring a destroyer against the mothers of their young men; suddenly I will bring down on them anguish and terror.
24015009 The mother of seven will grow faint and breathe her last. Her sun will set while it is still day; she will be disgraced and humiliated. I will put the survivors to the sword before their enemies,” declares the Lord.
24015010 Alas, my mother, that you gave me birth, a man with whom the whole land strives and contends! I have neither lent nor borrowed, yet everyone curses me.
24015011 The Lord said, “Surely I will deliver you for a good purpose; surely I will make your enemies plead with you in times of disaster and times of distress.
24015012 “Can a man break iron— iron from the north—or bronze?
24015013 “Your wealth and your treasures I will give as plunder, without charge, because of all your sins throughout your country.
24015014 I will enslave you to your enemies in a land you do not know, for my anger will kindle a fire that will burn against you.”
24015015 Lord, you understand; remember me and care for me. Avenge me on my persecutors. You are long-suffering—do not take me away; think of how I suffer reproach for your sake.
24015016 When your words came, I ate them; they were my joy and my heart’s delight, for I bear your name, Lord God Almighty.
24015017 I never sat in the company of revelers, never made merry with them; I sat alone because your hand was on me and you had filled me with indignation.
24015018 Why is my pain unending and my wound grievous and incurable? You are to me like a deceptive brook, like a spring that fails.
24015019 Therefore this is what the Lord says: “If you repent, I will restore you that you may serve me; if you utter worthy, not worthless, words, you will be my spokesman. Let this people turn to you, but you must not turn to them.
24015020 I will make you a wall to this people, a fortified wall of bronze; they will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you to rescue and save you,” declares the Lord.
24015021 “I will save you from the hands of the wicked and deliver you from the grasp of the cruel.”
24016001 Then the word of the Lord came to me:
24016002 “You must not marry and have sons or daughters in this place.”
24016003 For this is what the Lord says about the sons and daughters born in this land and about the women who are their mothers and the men who are their fathers:
24016004 “They will die of deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried but will be like dung lying on the ground. They will perish by sword and famine, and their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals.”
24016005 For this is what the Lord says: “Do not enter a house where there is a funeral meal; do not go to mourn or show sympathy, because I have withdrawn my blessing, my love and my pity from this people,” declares the Lord.
24016006 “Both high and low will die in this land. They will not be buried or mourned, and no one will cut themselves or shave their head for the dead.
24016007 No one will offer food to comfort those who mourn for the dead—not even for a father or a mother—nor will anyone give them a drink to console them.
24016008 “And do not enter a house where there is feasting and sit down to eat and drink.
24016009 For this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Before your eyes and in your days I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in this place.
24016010 “When you tell these people all this and they ask you, ‘Why has the Lord decreed such a great disaster against us? What wrong have we done? What sin have we committed against the Lord our God?’
24016011 then say to them, ‘It is because your ancestors forsook me,’ declares the Lord, ‘and followed other gods and served and worshiped them. They forsook me and did not keep my law.
24016012 But you have behaved more wickedly than your ancestors. See how all of you are following the stubbornness of your evil hearts instead of obeying me.
24016013 So I will throw you out of this land into a land neither you nor your ancestors have known, and there you will serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.’
24016014 “However, the days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when it will no longer be said, ‘As surely as the Lord lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,’
24016015 but it will be said, ‘As surely as the Lord lives, who brought the Israelites up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them.’ For I will restore them to the land I gave their ancestors.
24016016 “But now I will send for many fishermen,” declares the Lord, “and they will catch them. After that I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill and from the crevices of the rocks.
24016017 My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from me, nor is their sin concealed from my eyes.
24016018 I will repay them double for their wickedness and their sin, because they have defiled my land with the lifeless forms of their vile images and have filled my inheritance with their detestable idols.”
24016019 Lord, my strength and my fortress, my refuge in time of distress, to you the nations will come from the ends of the earth and say, “Our ancestors possessed nothing but false gods, worthless idols that did them no good.
24016020 Do people make their own gods? Yes, but they are not gods!”
24016021 “Therefore I will teach them— this time I will teach them my power and might. Then they will know that my name is the Lord.
24017001 “Judah’s sin is engraved with an iron tool, inscribed with a flint point, on the tablets of their hearts and on the horns of their altars.
24017002 Even their children remember their altars and Asherah poles beside the spreading trees and on the high hills.
24017003 My mountain in the land and your wealth and all your treasures I will give away as plunder, together with your high places, because of sin throughout your country.
24017004 Through your own fault you will lose the inheritance I gave you. I will enslave you to your enemies in a land you do not know, for you have kindled my anger, and it will burn forever.”
24017005 This is what the Lord says: “Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who draws strength from mere flesh and whose heart turns away from the Lord.
24017006 That person will be like a bush in the wastelands; they will not see prosperity when it comes. They will dwell in the parched places of the desert, in a salt land where no one lives.
24017007 “But blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord, whose confidence is in him.
24017008 They will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit.”
24017009 The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?
24017010 “I the Lord search the heart and examine the mind, to reward each person according to their conduct, according to what their deeds deserve.”
24017011 Like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay are those who gain riches by unjust means. When their lives are half gone, their riches will desert them, and in the end they will prove to be fools.
24017012 A glorious throne, exalted from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary.
24017013 Lord, you are the hope of Israel; all who forsake you will be put to shame. Those who turn away from you will be written in the dust because they have forsaken the Lord, the spring of living water.
24017014 Heal me, Lord, and I will be healed; save me and I will be saved, for you are the one I praise.
24017015 They keep saying to me, “Where is the word of the Lord? Let it now be fulfilled!”
24017016 I have not run away from being your shepherd; you know I have not desired the day of despair. What passes my lips is open before you.
24017017 Do not be a terror to me; you are my refuge in the day of disaster.
24017018 Let my persecutors be put to shame, but keep me from shame; let them be terrified, but keep me from terror. Bring on them the day of disaster; destroy them with double destruction.
24017019 This is what the Lord said to me: “Go and stand at the Gate of the People, through which the kings of Judah go in and out; stand also at all the other gates of Jerusalem.
24017020 Say to them, ‘Hear the word of the Lord, you kings of Judah and all people of Judah and everyone living in Jerusalem who come through these gates.
24017021 This is what the Lord says: Be careful not to carry a load on the Sabbath day or bring it through the gates of Jerusalem.
24017022 Do not bring a load out of your houses or do any work on the Sabbath, but keep the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your ancestors.
24017023 Yet they did not listen or pay attention; they were stiff-necked and would not listen or respond to discipline.
24017024 But if you are careful to obey me, declares the Lord, and bring no load through the gates of this city on the Sabbath, but keep the Sabbath day holy by not doing any work on it,
24017025 then kings who sit on David’s throne will come through the gates of this city with their officials. They and their officials will come riding in chariots and on horses, accompanied by the men of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, and this city will be inhabited forever.
24017026 People will come from the towns of Judah and the villages around Jerusalem, from the territory of Benjamin and the western foothills, from the hill country and the Negev, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and incense, and bringing thank offerings to the house of the Lord.
24017027 But if you do not obey me to keep the Sabbath day holy by not carrying any load as you come through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle an unquenchable fire in the gates of Jerusalem that will consume her fortresses.’ ”
24018001 This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
24018002 “Go down to the potter’s house, and there I will give you my message.”
24018003 So I went down to the potter’s house, and I saw him working at the wheel.
24018004 But the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands; so the potter formed it into another pot, shaping it as seemed best to him.
24018005 Then the word of the Lord came to me.
24018006 He said, “Can I not do with you, Israel, as this potter does?” declares the Lord. “Like clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, Israel.
24018007 If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down and destroyed,
24018008 and if that nation I warned repents of its evil, then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned.
24018009 And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up and planted,
24018010 and if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me, then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it.
24018011 “Now therefore say to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, ‘This is what the Lord says: Look! I am preparing a disaster for you and devising a plan against you. So turn from your evil ways, each one of you, and reform your ways and your actions.’
24018012 But they will reply, ‘It’s no use. We will continue with our own plans; we will all follow the stubbornness of our evil hearts.’ ”
24018013 Therefore this is what the Lord says: “Inquire among the nations: Who has ever heard anything like this? A most horrible thing has been done by Virgin Israel.
24018014 Does the snow of Lebanon ever vanish from its rocky slopes? Do its cool waters from distant sources ever stop flowing?
24018015 Yet my people have forgotten me; they burn incense to worthless idols, which made them stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths. They made them walk in byways, on roads not built up.
24018016 Their land will be an object of horror and of lasting scorn; all who pass by will be appalled and will shake their heads.
24018017 Like a wind from the east, I will scatter them before their enemies; I will show them my back and not my face in the day of their disaster.”
24018018 They said, “Come, let’s make plans against Jeremiah; for the teaching of the law by the priest will not cease, nor will counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophets. So come, let’s attack him with our tongues and pay no attention to anything he says.”
24018019 Listen to me, Lord; hear what my accusers are saying!
24018020 Should good be repaid with evil? Yet they have dug a pit for me. Remember that I stood before you and spoke in their behalf to turn your wrath away from them.
24018021 So give their children over to famine; hand them over to the power of the sword. Let their wives be made childless and widows; let their men be put to death, their young men slain by the sword in battle.
24018022 Let a cry be heard from their houses when you suddenly bring invaders against them, for they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden snares for my feet.
24018023 But you, Lord, know all their plots to kill me. Do not forgive their crimes or blot out their sins from your sight. Let them be overthrown before you; deal with them in the time of your anger.
24019001 This is what the Lord says: “Go and buy a clay jar from a potter. Take along some of the elders of the people and of the priests
24019002 and go out to the Valley of Ben Hinnom, near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate. There proclaim the words I tell you,
24019003 and say, ‘Hear the word of the Lord, you kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem. This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Listen! I am going to bring a disaster on this place that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle.
24019004 For they have forsaken me and made this a place of foreign gods; they have burned incense in it to gods that neither they nor their ancestors nor the kings of Judah ever knew, and they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent.
24019005 They have built the high places of Baal to burn their children in the fire as offerings to Baal—something I did not command or mention, nor did it enter my mind.
24019006 So beware, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when people will no longer call this place Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.
24019007 “ ‘In this place I will ruin the plans of Judah and Jerusalem. I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies, at the hands of those who want to kill them, and I will give their carcasses as food to the birds and the wild animals.
24019008 I will devastate this city and make it an object of horror and scorn; all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff because of all its wounds.
24019009 I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters, and they will eat one another’s flesh because their enemies will press the siege so hard against them to destroy them.’
24019010 “Then break the jar while those who go with you are watching,
24019011 and say to them, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty says: I will smash this nation and this city just as this potter’s jar is smashed and cannot be repaired. They will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room.
24019012 This is what I will do to this place and to those who live here, declares the Lord. I will make this city like Topheth.
24019013 The houses in Jerusalem and those of the kings of Judah will be defiled like this place, Topheth—all the houses where they burned incense on the roofs to all the starry hosts and poured out drink offerings to other gods.’ ”
24019014 Jeremiah then returned from Topheth, where the Lord had sent him to prophesy, and stood in the court of the Lord’s temple and said to all the people,
24019015 “This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘Listen! I am going to bring on this city and all the villages around it every disaster I pronounced against them, because they were stiff-necked and would not listen to my words.’ ”
24020001 When the priest Pashhur son of Immer, the official in charge of the temple of the Lord, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things,
24020002 he had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put in the stocks at the Upper Gate of Benjamin at the Lord’s temple.
24020003 The next day, when Pashhur released him from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “The Lord’s name for you is not Pashhur, but Terror on Every Side.
24020004 For this is what the Lord says: ‘I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends; with your own eyes you will see them fall by the sword of their enemies. I will give all Judah into the hands of the king of Babylon, who will carry them away to Babylon or put them to the sword.
24020005 I will deliver all the wealth of this city into the hands of their enemies—all its products, all its valuables and all the treasures of the kings of Judah. They will take it away as plunder and carry it off to Babylon.
24020006 And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house will go into exile to Babylon. There you will die and be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied lies.’ ”
24020007 You deceived me, Lord, and I was deceived ; you overpowered me and prevailed. I am ridiculed all day long; everyone mocks me.
24020008 Whenever I speak, I cry out proclaiming violence and destruction. So the word of the Lord has brought me insult and reproach all day long.
24020009 But if I say, “I will not mention his word or speak anymore in his name,” his word is in my heart like a fire, a fire shut up in my bones. I am weary of holding it in; indeed, I cannot.
24020010 I hear many whispering, “Terror on every side! Denounce him! Let’s denounce him!” All my friends are waiting for me to slip, saying, “Perhaps he will be deceived; then we will prevail over him and take our revenge on him.”
24020011 But the Lord is with me like a mighty warrior; so my persecutors will stumble and not prevail. They will fail and be thoroughly disgraced; their dishonor will never be forgotten.
24020012 Lord Almighty, you who examine the righteous and probe the heart and mind, let me see your vengeance on them, for to you I have committed my cause.
24020013 Sing to the Lord! Give praise to the Lord! He rescues the life of the needy from the hands of the wicked.
24020014 Cursed be the day I was born! May the day my mother bore me not be blessed!
24020015 Cursed be the man who brought my father the news, who made him very glad, saying, “A child is born to you—a son!”
24020016 May that man be like the towns the Lord overthrew without pity. May he hear wailing in the morning, a battle cry at noon.
24020017 For he did not kill me in the womb, with my mother as my grave, her womb enlarged forever.
24020018 Why did I ever come out of the womb to see trouble and sorrow and to end my days in shame?
24021001 The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur son of Malkijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah. They said:
24021002 “Inquire now of the Lord for us because Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is attacking us. Perhaps the Lord will perform wonders for us as in times past so that he will withdraw from us.”
24021003 But Jeremiah answered them, “Tell Zedekiah,
24021004 ‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I am about to turn against you the weapons of war that are in your hands, which you are using to fight the king of Babylon and the Babylonians who are outside the wall besieging you. And I will gather them inside this city.
24021005 I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm in furious anger and in great wrath.
24021006 I will strike down those who live in this city—both man and beast—and they will die of a terrible plague.
24021007 After that, declares the Lord, I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials and the people in this city who survive the plague, sword and famine, into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to their enemies who want to kill them. He will put them to the sword; he will show them no mercy or pity or compassion.’
24021008 “Furthermore, tell the people, ‘This is what the Lord says: See, I am setting before you the way of life and the way of death.
24021009 Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine or plague. But whoever goes out and surrenders to the Babylonians who are besieging you will live; they will escape with their lives.
24021010 I have determined to do this city harm and not good, declares the Lord. It will be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will destroy it with fire.’
24021011 “Moreover, say to the royal house of Judah, ‘Hear the word of the Lord.
24021012 This is what the Lord says to you, house of David: “ ‘Administer justice every morning; rescue from the hand of the oppressor the one who has been robbed, or my wrath will break out and burn like fire because of the evil you have done— burn with no one to quench it.
24021013 I am against you, Jerusalem, you who live above this valley on the rocky plateau, declares the Lord— you who say, “Who can come against us? Who can enter our refuge?”
24021014 I will punish you as your deeds deserve, declares the Lord. I will kindle a fire in your forests that will consume everything around you.’ ”
24022001 This is what the Lord says: “Go down to the palace of the king of Judah and proclaim this message there:
24022002 ‘Hear the word of the Lord to you, king of Judah, you who sit on David’s throne—you, your officials and your people who come through these gates.
24022003 This is what the Lord says: Do what is just and right. Rescue from the hand of the oppressor the one who has been robbed. Do no wrong or violence to the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place.
24022004 For if you are careful to carry out these commands, then kings who sit on David’s throne will come through the gates of this palace, riding in chariots and on horses, accompanied by their officials and their people.
24022005 But if you do not obey these commands, declares the Lord, I swear by myself that this palace will become a ruin.’ ”
24022006 For this is what the Lord says about the palace of the king of Judah: “Though you are like Gilead to me, like the summit of Lebanon, I will surely make you like a wasteland, like towns not inhabited.
24022007 I will send destroyers against you, each man with his weapons, and they will cut up your fine cedar beams and throw them into the fire.
24022008 “People from many nations will pass by this city and will ask one another, ‘Why has the Lord done such a thing to this great city?’
24022009 And the answer will be: ‘Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God and have worshiped and served other gods.’ ”
24022010 Do not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss; rather, weep bitterly for him who is exiled, because he will never return nor see his native land again.
24022011 For this is what the Lord says about Shallum son of Josiah, who succeeded his father as king of Judah but has gone from this place: “He will never return.
24022012 He will die in the place where they have led him captive; he will not see this land again.”
24022013 “Woe to him who builds his palace by unrighteousness, his upper rooms by injustice, making his own people work for nothing, not paying them for their labor.
24022014 He says, ‘I will build myself a great palace with spacious upper rooms.’ So he makes large windows in it, panels it with cedar and decorates it in red.
24022015 “Does it make you a king to have more and more cedar? Did not your father have food and drink? He did what was right and just, so all went well with him.
24022016 He defended the cause of the poor and needy, and so all went well. Is that not what it means to know me?” declares the Lord.
24022017 “But your eyes and your heart are set only on dishonest gain, on shedding innocent blood and on oppression and extortion.”
24022018 Therefore this is what the Lord says about Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah: “They will not mourn for him: ‘Alas, my brother! Alas, my sister!’ They will not mourn for him: ‘Alas, my master! Alas, his splendor!’
24022019 He will have the burial of a donkey— dragged away and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem.”
24022020 “Go up to Lebanon and cry out, let your voice be heard in Bashan, cry out from Abarim, for all your allies are crushed.
24022021 I warned you when you felt secure, but you said, ‘I will not listen!’ This has been your way from your youth; you have not obeyed me.
24022022 The wind will drive all your shepherds away, and your allies will go into exile. Then you will be ashamed and disgraced because of all your wickedness.
24022023 You who live in ‘Lebanon, ’ who are nestled in cedar buildings, how you will groan when pangs come upon you, pain like that of a woman in labor!
24022024 “As surely as I live,” declares the Lord, “even if you, Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, were a signet ring on my right hand, I would still pull you off.
24022025 I will deliver you into the hands of those who want to kill you, those you fear—Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the Babylonians.
24022026 I will hurl you and the mother who gave you birth into another country, where neither of you was born, and there you both will die.
24022027 You will never come back to the land you long to return to.”
24022028 Is this man Jehoiachin a despised, broken pot, an object no one wants? Why will he and his children be hurled out, cast into a land they do not know?
24022029 O land, land, land, hear the word of the Lord!
24022030 This is what the Lord says: “Record this man as if childless, a man who will not prosper in his lifetime, for none of his offspring will prosper, none will sit on the throne of David or rule anymore in Judah.”
24023001 “Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture!” declares the Lord.
24023002 Therefore this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to the shepherds who tend my people: “Because you have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not bestowed care on them, I will bestow punishment on you for the evil you have done,” declares the Lord.
24023003 “I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them and will bring them back to their pasture, where they will be fruitful and increase in number.
24023004 I will place shepherds over them who will tend them, and they will no longer be afraid or terrified, nor will any be missing,” declares the Lord.
24023005 “The days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, a King who will reign wisely and do what is just and right in the land.
24023006 In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. This is the name by which he will be called: The Lord Our Righteous Savior.
24023007 “So then, the days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when people will no longer say, ‘As surely as the Lord lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,’
24023008 but they will say, ‘As surely as the Lord lives, who brought the descendants of Israel up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them.’ Then they will live in their own land.”
24023009 Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me; all my bones tremble. I am like a drunken man, like a strong man overcome by wine, because of the Lord and his holy words.
24023010 The land is full of adulterers; because of the curse the land lies parched and the pastures in the wilderness are withered. The prophets follow an evil course and use their power unjustly.
24023011 “Both prophet and priest are godless; even in my temple I find their wickedness,” declares the Lord.
24023012 “Therefore their path will become slippery; they will be banished to darkness and there they will fall. I will bring disaster on them in the year they are punished,” declares the Lord.
24023013 “Among the prophets of Samaria I saw this repulsive thing: They prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray.
24023014 And among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen something horrible: They commit adultery and live a lie. They strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that not one of them turns from their wickedness. They are all like Sodom to me; the people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah.”
24023015 Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty says concerning the prophets: “I will make them eat bitter food and drink poisoned water, because from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has spread throughout the land.”
24023016 This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Do not listen to what the prophets are prophesying to you; they fill you with false hopes. They speak visions from their own minds, not from the mouth of the Lord.
24023017 They keep saying to those who despise me, ‘The Lord says: You will have peace.’ And to all who follow the stubbornness of their hearts they say, ‘No harm will come to you.’
24023018 But which of them has stood in the council of the Lord to see or to hear his word? Who has listened and heard his word?
24023019 See, the storm of the Lord will burst out in wrath, a whirlwind swirling down on the heads of the wicked.
24023020 The anger of the Lord will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart. In days to come you will understand it clearly.
24023021 I did not send these prophets, yet they have run with their message; I did not speak to them, yet they have prophesied.
24023022 But if they had stood in my council, they would have proclaimed my words to my people and would have turned them from their evil ways and from their evil deeds.
24023023 “Am I only a God nearby,” declares the Lord, “and not a God far away?
24023024 Who can hide in secret places so that I cannot see them?” declares the Lord. “Do not I fill heaven and earth?” declares the Lord.
24023025 “I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my name. They say, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’
24023026 How long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who prophesy the delusions of their own minds?
24023027 They think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget my name, just as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship.
24023028 Let the prophet who has a dream recount the dream, but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain?” declares the Lord.
24023029 “Is not my word like fire,” declares the Lord, “and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces?
24023030 “Therefore,” declares the Lord, “I am against the prophets who steal from one another words supposedly from me.
24023031 Yes,” declares the Lord, “I am against the prophets who wag their own tongues and yet declare, ‘The Lord declares.’
24023032 Indeed, I am against those who prophesy false dreams,” declares the Lord. “They tell them and lead my people astray with their reckless lies, yet I did not send or appoint them. They do not benefit these people in the least,” declares the Lord.
24023033 “When these people, or a prophet or a priest, ask you, ‘What is the message from the Lord?’ say to them, ‘What message? I will forsake you, declares the Lord.’
24023034 If a prophet or a priest or anyone else claims, ‘This is a message from the Lord,’ I will punish them and their household.
24023035 This is what each of you keeps saying to your friends and other Israelites: ‘What is the Lord’s answer?’ or ‘What has the Lord spoken?’
24023036 But you must not mention ‘a message from the Lord’ again, because each one’s word becomes their own message. So you distort the words of the living God, the Lord Almighty, our God.
24023037 This is what you keep saying to a prophet: ‘What is the Lord’s answer to you?’ or ‘What has the Lord spoken?’
24023038 Although you claim, ‘This is a message from the Lord,’ this is what the Lord says: You used the words, ‘This is a message from the Lord,’ even though I told you that you must not claim, ‘This is a message from the Lord.’
24023039 Therefore, I will surely forget you and cast you out of my presence along with the city I gave to you and your ancestors.
24023040 I will bring on you everlasting disgrace—everlasting shame that will not be forgotten.”
24024001 After Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and the officials, the skilled workers and the artisans of Judah were carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Lord showed me two baskets of figs placed in front of the temple of the Lord.
24024002 One basket had very good figs, like those that ripen early; the other basket had very bad figs, so bad they could not be eaten.
24024003 Then the Lord asked me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” “Figs,” I answered. “The good ones are very good, but the bad ones are so bad they cannot be eaten.”
24024004 Then the word of the Lord came to me:
24024005 “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘Like these good figs, I regard as good the exiles from Judah, whom I sent away from this place to the land of the Babylonians.
24024006 My eyes will watch over them for their good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up and not tear them down; I will plant them and not uproot them.
24024007 I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the Lord. They will be my people, and I will be their God, for they will return to me with all their heart.
24024008 “ ‘But like the bad figs, which are so bad they cannot be eaten,’ says the Lord, ‘so will I deal with Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials and the survivors from Jerusalem, whether they remain in this land or live in Egypt.
24024009 I will make them abhorrent and an offense to all the kingdoms of the earth, a reproach and a byword, a curse and an object of ridicule, wherever I banish them.
24024010 I will send the sword, famine and plague against them until they are destroyed from the land I gave to them and their ancestors.’ ”
24025001 The word came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
24025002 So Jeremiah the prophet said to all the people of Judah and to all those living in Jerusalem:
24025003 For twenty-three years—from the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah until this very day—the word of the Lord has come to me and I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened.
24025004 And though the Lord has sent all his servants the prophets to you again and again, you have not listened or paid any attention.
24025005 They said, “Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways and your evil practices, and you can stay in the land the Lord gave to you and your ancestors for ever and ever.
24025006 Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them; do not arouse my anger with what your hands have made. Then I will not harm you.”
24025007 “But you did not listen to me,” declares the Lord, “and you have aroused my anger with what your hands have made, and you have brought harm to yourselves.”
24025008 Therefore the Lord Almighty says this: “Because you have not listened to my words,
24025009 I will summon all the peoples of the north and my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,” declares the Lord, “and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants and against all the surrounding nations. I will completely destroy them and make them an object of horror and scorn, and an everlasting ruin.
24025010 I will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom, the sound of millstones and the light of the lamp.
24025011 This whole country will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
24025012 “But when the seventy years are fulfilled, I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation, the land of the Babylonians, for their guilt,” declares the Lord, “and will make it desolate forever.
24025013 I will bring on that land all the things I have spoken against it, all that are written in this book and prophesied by Jeremiah against all the nations.
24025014 They themselves will be enslaved by many nations and great kings; I will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.”
24025015 This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, said to me: “Take from my hand this cup filled with the wine of my wrath and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it.
24025016 When they drink it, they will stagger and go mad because of the sword I will send among them.”
24025017 So I took the cup from the Lord’s hand and made all the nations to whom he sent me drink it:
24025018 Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, its kings and officials, to make them a ruin and an object of horror and scorn, a curse —as they are today;
24025019 Pharaoh king of Egypt, his attendants, his officials and all his people,
24025020 and all the foreign people there; all the kings of Uz; all the kings of the Philistines (those of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the people left at Ashdod);
24025021 Edom, Moab and Ammon;
24025022 all the kings of Tyre and Sidon; the kings of the coastlands across the sea;
24025023 Dedan, Tema, Buz and all who are in distant places ;
24025024 all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the foreign people who live in the wilderness;
24025025 all the kings of Zimri, Elam and Media;
24025026 and all the kings of the north, near and far, one after the other—all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. And after all of them, the king of Sheshak will drink it too.
24025027 “Then tell them, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Drink, get drunk and vomit, and fall to rise no more because of the sword I will send among you.’
24025028 But if they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink, tell them, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty says: You must drink it!
24025029 See, I am beginning to bring disaster on the city that bears my Name, and will you indeed go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am calling down a sword on all who live on the earth, declares the Lord Almighty.’
24025030 “Now prophesy all these words against them and say to them: “ ‘The Lord will roar from on high; he will thunder from his holy dwelling and roar mightily against his land. He will shout like those who tread the grapes, shout against all who live on the earth.
24025031 The tumult will resound to the ends of the earth, for the Lord will bring charges against the nations; he will bring judgment on all mankind and put the wicked to the sword,’ ” declares the Lord.
24025032 This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Look! Disaster is spreading from nation to nation; a mighty storm is rising from the ends of the earth.”
24025033 At that time those slain by the Lord will be everywhere—from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be mourned or gathered up or buried, but will be like dung lying on the ground.
24025034 Weep and wail, you shepherds; roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock. For your time to be slaughtered has come; you will fall like the best of the rams.
24025035 The shepherds will have nowhere to flee, the leaders of the flock no place to escape.
24025036 Hear the cry of the shepherds, the wailing of the leaders of the flock, for the Lord is destroying their pasture.
24025037 The peaceful meadows will be laid waste because of the fierce anger of the Lord.
24025038 Like a lion he will leave his lair, and their land will become desolate because of the sword of the oppressor and because of the Lord’s fierce anger.
24026001 Early in the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came from the Lord:
24026002 “This is what the Lord says: Stand in the courtyard of the Lord’s house and speak to all the people of the towns of Judah who come to worship in the house of the Lord. Tell them everything I command you; do not omit a word.
24026003 Perhaps they will listen and each will turn from their evil ways. Then I will relent and not inflict on them the disaster I was planning because of the evil they have done.
24026004 Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord says: If you do not listen to me and follow my law, which I have set before you,
24026005 and if you do not listen to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I have sent to you again and again (though you have not listened),
24026006 then I will make this house like Shiloh and this city a curse among all the nations of the earth.’ ”
24026007 The priests, the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speak these words in the house of the Lord.
24026008 But as soon as Jeremiah finished telling all the people everything the Lord had commanded him to say, the priests, the prophets and all the people seized him and said, “You must die!
24026009 Why do you prophesy in the Lord’s name that this house will be like Shiloh and this city will be desolate and deserted?” And all the people crowded around Jeremiah in the house of the Lord.
24026010 When the officials of Judah heard about these things, they went up from the royal palace to the house of the Lord and took their places at the entrance of the New Gate of the Lord’s house.
24026011 Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and all the people, “This man should be sentenced to death because he has prophesied against this city. You have heard it with your own ears!”
24026012 Then Jeremiah said to all the officials and all the people: “The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the things you have heard.
24026013 Now reform your ways and your actions and obey the Lord your God. Then the Lord will relent and not bring the disaster he has pronounced against you.
24026014 As for me, I am in your hands; do with me whatever you think is good and right.
24026015 Be assured, however, that if you put me to death, you will bring the guilt of innocent blood on yourselves and on this city and on those who live in it, for in truth the Lord has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.”
24026016 Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, “This man should not be sentenced to death! He has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God.”
24026017 Some of the elders of the land stepped forward and said to the entire assembly of people,
24026018 “Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah. He told all the people of Judah, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty says: “ ‘Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.’
24026019 “Did Hezekiah king of Judah or anyone else in Judah put him to death? Did not Hezekiah fear the Lord and seek his favor? And did not the Lord relent, so that he did not bring the disaster he pronounced against them? We are about to bring a terrible disaster on ourselves!”
24026020 (Now Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath Jearim was another man who prophesied in the name of the Lord; he prophesied the same things against this city and this land as Jeremiah did.
24026021 When King Jehoiakim and all his officers and officials heard his words, the king was determined to put him to death. But Uriah heard of it and fled in fear to Egypt.
24026022 King Jehoiakim, however, sent Elnathan son of Akbor to Egypt, along with some other men.
24026023 They brought Uriah out of Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who had him struck down with a sword and his body thrown into the burial place of the common people.)
24026024 Furthermore, Ahikam son of Shaphan supported Jeremiah, and so he was not handed over to the people to be put to death.
24027001 Early in the reign of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
24027002 This is what the Lord said to me: “Make a yoke out of straps and crossbars and put it on your neck.
24027003 Then send word to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre and Sidon through the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.
24027004 Give them a message for their masters and say, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “Tell this to your masters:
24027005 With my great power and outstretched arm I made the earth and its people and the animals that are on it, and I give it to anyone I please.
24027006 Now I will give all your countries into the hands of my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; I will make even the wild animals subject to him.
24027007 All nations will serve him and his son and his grandson until the time for his land comes; then many nations and great kings will subjugate him.
24027008 “ ‘ “If, however, any nation or kingdom will not serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon or bow its neck under his yoke, I will punish that nation with the sword, famine and plague, declares the Lord, until I destroy it by his hand.
24027009 So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your interpreters of dreams, your mediums or your sorcerers who tell you, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon.’
24027010 They prophesy lies to you that will only serve to remove you far from your lands; I will banish you and you will perish.
24027011 But if any nation will bow its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will let that nation remain in its own land to till it and to live there, declares the Lord.” ’ ”
24027012 I gave the same message to Zedekiah king of Judah. I said, “Bow your neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon; serve him and his people, and you will live.
24027013 Why will you and your people die by the sword, famine and plague with which the Lord has threatened any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
24027014 Do not listen to the words of the prophets who say to you, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they are prophesying lies to you.
24027015 ‘I have not sent them,’ declares the Lord. ‘They are prophesying lies in my name. Therefore, I will banish you and you will perish, both you and the prophets who prophesy to you.’ ”
24027016 Then I said to the priests and all these people, “This is what the Lord says: Do not listen to the prophets who say, ‘Very soon now the articles from the Lord’s house will be brought back from Babylon.’ They are prophesying lies to you.
24027017 Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon, and you will live. Why should this city become a ruin?
24027018 If they are prophets and have the word of the Lord, let them plead with the Lord Almighty that the articles remaining in the house of the Lord and in the palace of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem not be taken to Babylon.
24027019 For this is what the Lord Almighty says about the pillars, the bronze Sea, the movable stands and the other articles that are left in this city,
24027020 which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away when he carried Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem—
24027021 yes, this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says about the things that are left in the house of the Lord and in the palace of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem:
24027022 ‘They will be taken to Babylon and there they will remain until the day I come for them,’ declares the Lord. ‘Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.’ ”
24028001 In the fifth month of that same year, the fourth year, early in the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, who was from Gibeon, said to me in the house of the Lord in the presence of the priests and all the people:
24028002 “This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
24028003 Within two years I will bring back to this place all the articles of the Lord’s house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon removed from here and took to Babylon.
24028004 I will also bring back to this place Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and all the other exiles from Judah who went to Babylon,’ declares the Lord, ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’ ”
24028005 Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah before the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the Lord.
24028006 He said, “Amen! May the Lord do so! May the Lord fulfill the words you have prophesied by bringing the articles of the Lord’s house and all the exiles back to this place from Babylon.
24028007 Nevertheless, listen to what I have to say in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people:
24028008 From early times the prophets who preceded you and me have prophesied war, disaster and plague against many countries and great kingdoms.
24028009 But the prophet who prophesies peace will be recognized as one truly sent by the Lord only if his prediction comes true.”
24028010 Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it,
24028011 and he said before all the people, “This is what the Lord says: ‘In the same way I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon off the neck of all the nations within two years.’ ” At this, the prophet Jeremiah went on his way.
24028012 After the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
24028013 “Go and tell Hananiah, ‘This is what the Lord says: You have broken a wooden yoke, but in its place you will get a yoke of iron.
24028014 This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations to make them serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they will serve him. I will even give him control over the wild animals.’ ”
24028015 Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, “Listen, Hananiah! The Lord has not sent you, yet you have persuaded this nation to trust in lies.
24028016 Therefore this is what the Lord says: ‘I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. This very year you are going to die, because you have preached rebellion against the Lord.’ ”
24028017 In the seventh month of that same year, Hananiah the prophet died.
24029001 This is the text of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the surviving elders among the exiles and to the priests, the prophets and all the other people Nebuchadnezzar had carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
24029002 (This was after King Jehoiachin and the queen mother, the court officials and the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the skilled workers and the artisans had gone into exile from Jerusalem.)
24029003 He entrusted the letter to Elasah son of Shaphan and to Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon. It said:
24029004 This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says to all those I carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:
24029005 “Build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce.
24029006 Marry and have sons and daughters; find wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage, so that they too may have sons and daughters. Increase in number there; do not decrease.
24029007 Also, seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried you into exile. Pray to the Lord for it, because if it prospers, you too will prosper.”
24029008 Yes, this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “Do not let the prophets and diviners among you deceive you. Do not listen to the dreams you encourage them to have.
24029009 They are prophesying lies to you in my name. I have not sent them,” declares the Lord.
24029010 This is what the Lord says: “When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will come to you and fulfill my good promise to bring you back to this place.
24029011 For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.
24029012 Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you.
24029013 You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.
24029014 I will be found by you,” declares the Lord, “and will bring you back from captivity. I will gather you from all the nations and places where I have banished you,” declares the Lord, “and will bring you back to the place from which I carried you into exile.”
24029015 You may say, “The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,”
24029016 but this is what the Lord says about the king who sits on David’s throne and all the people who remain in this city, your fellow citizens who did not go with you into exile—
24029017 yes, this is what the Lord Almighty says: “I will send the sword, famine and plague against them and I will make them like figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten.
24029018 I will pursue them with the sword, famine and plague and will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse and an object of horror, of scorn and reproach, among all the nations where I drive them.
24029019 For they have not listened to my words,” declares the Lord, “words that I sent to them again and again by my servants the prophets. And you exiles have not listened either,” declares the Lord.
24029020 Therefore, hear the word of the Lord, all you exiles whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.
24029021 This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying lies to you in my name: “I will deliver them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will put them to death before your very eyes.
24029022 Because of them, all the exiles from Judah who are in Babylon will use this curse: ‘May the Lord treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon burned in the fire.’
24029023 For they have done outrageous things in Israel; they have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and in my name they have uttered lies—which I did not authorize. I know it and am a witness to it,” declares the Lord.
24029024 Tell Shemaiah the Nehelamite,
24029025 “This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You sent letters in your own name to all the people in Jerusalem, to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, and to all the other priests. You said to Zephaniah,
24029026 ‘The Lord has appointed you priest in place of Jehoiada to be in charge of the house of the Lord; you should put any maniac who acts like a prophet into the stocks and neck-irons.
24029027 So why have you not reprimanded Jeremiah from Anathoth, who poses as a prophet among you?
24029028 He has sent this message to us in Babylon: It will be a long time. Therefore build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce.’ ”
24029029 Zephaniah the priest, however, read the letter to Jeremiah the prophet.
24029030 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
24029031 “Send this message to all the exiles: ‘This is what the Lord says about Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, even though I did not send him, and has persuaded you to trust in lies,
24029032 this is what the Lord says: I will surely punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants. He will have no one left among this people, nor will he see the good things I will do for my people, declares the Lord, because he has preached rebellion against me.’ ”
24030001 This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
24030002 “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘Write in a book all the words I have spoken to you.
24030003 The days are coming,’ declares the Lord, ‘when I will bring my people Israel and Judah back from captivity and restore them to the land I gave their ancestors to possess,’ says the Lord.”
24030004 These are the words the Lord spoke concerning Israel and Judah:
24030005 “This is what the Lord says: “ ‘Cries of fear are heard— terror, not peace.
24030006 Ask and see: Can a man bear children? Then why do I see every strong man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor, every face turned deathly pale?
24030007 How awful that day will be! No other will be like it. It will be a time of trouble for Jacob, but he will be saved out of it.
24030008 “ ‘In that day,’ declares the Lord Almighty, ‘I will break the yoke off their necks and will tear off their bonds; no longer will foreigners enslave them.
24030009 Instead, they will serve the Lord their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them.
24030010 “ ‘So do not be afraid, Jacob my servant; do not be dismayed, Israel,’ declares the Lord. ‘I will surely save you out of a distant place, your descendants from the land of their exile. Jacob will again have peace and security, and no one will make him afraid.
24030011 I am with you and will save you,’ declares the Lord. ‘Though I completely destroy all the nations among which I scatter you, I will not completely destroy you. I will discipline you but only in due measure; I will not let you go entirely unpunished.’
24030012 “This is what the Lord says: “ ‘Your wound is incurable, your injury beyond healing.
24030013 There is no one to plead your cause, no remedy for your sore, no healing for you.
24030014 All your allies have forgotten you; they care nothing for you. I have struck you as an enemy would and punished you as would the cruel, because your guilt is so great and your sins so many.
24030015 Why do you cry out over your wound, your pain that has no cure? Because of your great guilt and many sins I have done these things to you.
24030016 “ ‘But all who devour you will be devoured; all your enemies will go into exile. Those who plunder you will be plundered; all who make spoil of you I will despoil.
24030017 But I will restore you to health and heal your wounds,’ declares the Lord, ‘because you are called an outcast, Zion for whom no one cares.’
24030018 “This is what the Lord says: “ ‘I will restore the fortunes of Jacob’s tents and have compassion on his dwellings; the city will be rebuilt on her ruins, and the palace will stand in its proper place.
24030019 From them will come songs of thanksgiving and the sound of rejoicing. I will add to their numbers, and they will not be decreased; I will bring them honor, and they will not be disdained.
24030020 Their children will be as in days of old, and their community will be established before me; I will punish all who oppress them.
24030021 Their leader will be one of their own; their ruler will arise from among them. I will bring him near and he will come close to me— for who is he who will devote himself to be close to me?’ declares the Lord.
24030022 “‘So you will be my people, and I will be your God.’ ”
24030023 See, the storm of the Lord will burst out in wrath, a driving wind swirling down on the heads of the wicked.
24030024 The fierce anger of the Lord will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart. In days to come you will understand this.
24031001 “At that time,” declares the Lord, “I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they will be my people.”
24031002 This is what the Lord says: “The people who survive the sword will find favor in the wilderness; I will come to give rest to Israel.”
24031003 The Lord appeared to us in the past, saying: “I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with unfailing kindness.
24031004 I will build you up again, and you, Virgin Israel, will be rebuilt. Again you will take up your timbrels and go out to dance with the joyful.
24031005 Again you will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria; the farmers will plant them and enjoy their fruit.
24031006 There will be a day when watchmen cry out on the hills of Ephraim, ‘Come, let us go up to Zion, to the Lord our God.’ ”
24031007 This is what the Lord says: “Sing with joy for Jacob; shout for the foremost of the nations. Make your praises heard, and say, ‘Lord, save your people, the remnant of Israel.’
24031008 See, I will bring them from the land of the north and gather them from the ends of the earth. Among them will be the blind and the lame, expectant mothers and women in labor; a great throng will return.
24031009 They will come with weeping; they will pray as I bring them back. I will lead them beside streams of water on a level path where they will not stumble, because I am Israel’s father, and Ephraim is my firstborn son.
24031010 “Hear the word of the Lord, you nations; proclaim it in distant coastlands: ‘He who scattered Israel will gather them and will watch over his flock like a shepherd.’
24031011 For the Lord will deliver Jacob and redeem them from the hand of those stronger than they.
24031012 They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion; they will rejoice in the bounty of the Lord— the grain, the new wine and the olive oil, the young of the flocks and herds. They will be like a well-watered garden, and they will sorrow no more.
24031013 Then young women will dance and be glad, young men and old as well. I will turn their mourning into gladness; I will give them comfort and joy instead of sorrow.
24031014 I will satisfy the priests with abundance, and my people will be filled with my bounty,” declares the Lord.
24031015 This is what the Lord says: “A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.”
24031016 This is what the Lord says: “Restrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears, for your work will be rewarded,” declares the Lord. “They will return from the land of the enemy.
24031017 So there is hope for your descendants,” declares the Lord. “Your children will return to their own land.
24031018 “I have surely heard Ephraim’s moaning: ‘You disciplined me like an unruly calf, and I have been disciplined. Restore me, and I will return, because you are the Lord my God.
24031019 After I strayed, I repented; after I came to understand, I beat my breast. I was ashamed and humiliated because I bore the disgrace of my youth.’
24031020 Is not Ephraim my dear son, the child in whom I delight? Though I often speak against him, I still remember him. Therefore my heart yearns for him; I have great compassion for him,” declares the Lord.
24031021 “Set up road signs; put up guideposts. Take note of the highway, the road that you take. Return, Virgin Israel, return to your towns.
24031022 How long will you wander, unfaithful Daughter Israel? The Lord will create a new thing on earth— the woman will return to the man.”
24031023 This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “When I bring them back from captivity, the people in the land of Judah and in its towns will once again use these words: ‘The Lord bless you, you prosperous city, you sacred mountain.’
24031024 People will live together in Judah and all its towns—farmers and those who move about with their flocks.
24031025 I will refresh the weary and satisfy the faint.”
24031026 At this I awoke and looked around. My sleep had been pleasant to me.
24031027 “The days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will plant the kingdoms of Israel and Judah with the offspring of people and of animals.
24031028 Just as I watched over them to uproot and tear down, and to overthrow, destroy and bring disaster, so I will watch over them to build and to plant,” declares the Lord.
24031029 “In those days people will no longer say, ‘The parents have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.’
24031030 Instead, everyone will die for their own sin; whoever eats sour grapes—their own teeth will be set on edge.
24031031 “The days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah.
24031032 It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they broke my covenant, though I was a husband to them, ” declares the Lord.
24031033 “This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time,” declares the Lord. “I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.
24031034 No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, ‘Know the Lord,’ because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,” declares the Lord. “For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.”
24031035 This is what the Lord says, he who appoints the sun to shine by day, who decrees the moon and stars to shine by night, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar— the Lord Almighty is his name:
24031036 “Only if these decrees vanish from my sight,” declares the Lord, “will Israel ever cease being a nation before me.”
24031037 This is what the Lord says: “Only if the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth below be searched out will I reject all the descendants of Israel because of all they have done,” declares the Lord.
24031038 “The days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when this city will be rebuilt for me from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.
24031039 The measuring line will stretch from there straight to the hill of Gareb and then turn to Goah.
24031040 The whole valley where dead bodies and ashes are thrown, and all the terraces out to the Kidron Valley on the east as far as the corner of the Horse Gate, will be holy to the Lord. The city will never again be uprooted or demolished.”
24032001 This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
24032002 The army of the king of Babylon was then besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace of Judah.
24032003 Now Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him there, saying, “Why do you prophesy as you do? You say, ‘This is what the Lord says: I am about to give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.
24032004 Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape the Babylonians but will certainly be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and will speak with him face to face and see him with his own eyes.
24032005 He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will remain until I deal with him, declares the Lord. If you fight against the Babylonians, you will not succeed.’ ”
24032006 Jeremiah said, “The word of the Lord came to me:
24032007 Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle is going to come to you and say, ‘Buy my field at Anathoth, because as nearest relative it is your right and duty to buy it.’
24032008 “Then, just as the Lord had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard and said, ‘Buy my field at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. Since it is your right to redeem it and possess it, buy it for yourself.’ “I knew that this was the word of the Lord;
24032009 so I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel and weighed out for him seventeen shekels of silver.
24032010 I signed and sealed the deed, had it witnessed, and weighed out the silver on the scales.
24032011 I took the deed of purchase—the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions, as well as the unsealed copy—
24032012 and I gave this deed to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and of the witnesses who had signed the deed and of all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard.
24032013 “In their presence I gave Baruch these instructions:
24032014 ‘This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Take these documents, both the sealed and unsealed copies of the deed of purchase, and put them in a clay jar so they will last a long time.
24032015 For this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Houses, fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.’
24032016 “After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to the Lord:
24032017 “Ah, Sovereign Lord, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too hard for you.
24032018 You show love to thousands but bring the punishment for the parents’ sins into the laps of their children after them. Great and mighty God, whose name is the Lord Almighty,
24032019 great are your purposes and mighty are your deeds. Your eyes are open to the ways of all mankind; you reward each person according to their conduct and as their deeds deserve.
24032020 You performed signs and wonders in Egypt and have continued them to this day, in Israel and among all mankind, and have gained the renown that is still yours.
24032021 You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror.
24032022 You gave them this land you had sworn to give their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey.
24032023 They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey you or follow your law; they did not do what you commanded them to do. So you brought all this disaster on them.
24032024 “See how the siege ramps are built up to take the city. Because of the sword, famine and plague, the city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians who are attacking it. What you said has happened, as you now see.
24032025 And though the city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians, you, Sovereign Lord, say to me, ‘Buy the field with silver and have the transaction witnessed.’ ”
24032026 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
24032027 “I am the Lord, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?
24032028 Therefore this is what the Lord says: I am about to give this city into the hands of the Babylonians and to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who will capture it.
24032029 The Babylonians who are attacking this city will come in and set it on fire; they will burn it down, along with the houses where the people aroused my anger by burning incense on the roofs to Baal and by pouring out drink offerings to other gods.
24032030 “The people of Israel and Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight from their youth; indeed, the people of Israel have done nothing but arouse my anger with what their hands have made, declares the Lord.
24032031 From the day it was built until now, this city has so aroused my anger and wrath that I must remove it from my sight.
24032032 The people of Israel and Judah have provoked me by all the evil they have done—they, their kings and officials, their priests and prophets, the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem.
24032033 They turned their backs to me and not their faces; though I taught them again and again, they would not listen or respond to discipline.
24032034 They set up their vile images in the house that bears my Name and defiled it.
24032035 They built high places for Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molek, though I never commanded—nor did it enter my mind—that they should do such a detestable thing and so make Judah sin.
24032036 “You are saying about this city, ‘By the sword, famine and plague it will be given into the hands of the king of Babylon’; but this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says:
24032037 I will surely gather them from all the lands where I banish them in my furious anger and great wrath; I will bring them back to this place and let them live in safety.
24032038 They will be my people, and I will be their God.
24032039 I will give them singleness of heart and action, so that they will always fear me and that all will then go well for them and for their children after them.
24032040 I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never stop doing good to them, and I will inspire them to fear me, so that they will never turn away from me.
24032041 I will rejoice in doing them good and will assuredly plant them in this land with all my heart and soul.
24032042 “This is what the Lord says: As I have brought all this great calamity on this people, so I will give them all the prosperity I have promised them.
24032043 Once more fields will be bought in this land of which you say, ‘It is a desolate waste, without people or animals, for it has been given into the hands of the Babylonians.’
24032044 Fields will be bought for silver, and deeds will be signed, sealed and witnessed in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah and in the towns of the hill country, of the western foothills and of the Negev, because I will restore their fortunes, declares the Lord.”
24033001 While Jeremiah was still confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of the Lord came to him a second time:
24033002 “This is what the Lord says, he who made the earth, the Lord who formed it and established it—the Lord is his name:
24033003 ‘Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know.’
24033004 For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says about the houses in this city and the royal palaces of Judah that have been torn down to be used against the siege ramps and the sword
24033005 in the fight with the Babylonians : ‘They will be filled with the dead bodies of the people I will slay in my anger and wrath. I will hide my face from this city because of all its wickedness.
24033006 “ ‘Nevertheless, I will bring health and healing to it; I will heal my people and will let them enjoy abundant peace and security.
24033007 I will bring Judah and Israel back from captivity and will rebuild them as they were before.
24033008 I will cleanse them from all the sin they have committed against me and will forgive all their sins of rebellion against me.
24033009 Then this city will bring me renown, joy, praise and honor before all nations on earth that hear of all the good things I do for it; and they will be in awe and will tremble at the abundant prosperity and peace I provide for it.’
24033010 “This is what the Lord says: ‘You say about this place, “It is a desolate waste, without people or animals.” Yet in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are deserted, inhabited by neither people nor animals, there will be heard once more
24033011 the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom, and the voices of those who bring thank offerings to the house of the Lord, saying, “Give thanks to the Lord Almighty, for the Lord is good; his love endures forever.” For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were before,’ says the Lord.
24033012 “This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘In this place, desolate and without people or animals—in all its towns there will again be pastures for shepherds to rest their flocks.
24033013 In the towns of the hill country, of the western foothills and of the Negev, in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah, flocks will again pass under the hand of the one who counts them,’ says the Lord.
24033014 “ ‘The days are coming,’ declares the Lord, ‘when I will fulfill the good promise I made to the people of Israel and Judah.
24033015 “ ‘In those days and at that time I will make a righteous Branch sprout from David’s line; he will do what is just and right in the land.
24033016 In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety. This is the name by which it will be called: The Lord Our Righteous Savior.’
24033017 For this is what the Lord says: ‘David will never fail to have a man to sit on the throne of Israel,
24033018 nor will the Levitical priests ever fail to have a man to stand before me continually to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings and to present sacrifices.’ ”
24033019 The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
24033020 “This is what the Lord says: ‘If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night, so that day and night no longer come at their appointed time,
24033021 then my covenant with David my servant—and my covenant with the Levites who are priests ministering before me—can be broken and David will no longer have a descendant to reign on his throne.
24033022 I will make the descendants of David my servant and the Levites who minister before me as countless as the stars in the sky and as measureless as the sand on the seashore.’ ”
24033023 The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
24033024 “Have you not noticed that these people are saying, ‘The Lord has rejected the two kingdoms he chose’? So they despise my people and no longer regard them as a nation.
24033025 This is what the Lord says: ‘If I have not made my covenant with day and night and established the laws of heaven and earth,
24033026 then I will reject the descendants of Jacob and David my servant and will not choose one of his sons to rule over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes and have compassion on them.’ ”
24034001 While Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms and peoples in the empire he ruled were fighting against Jerusalem and all its surrounding towns, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
24034002 “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Go to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him, ‘This is what the Lord says: I am about to give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down.
24034003 You will not escape from his grasp but will surely be captured and given into his hands. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes, and he will speak with you face to face. And you will go to Babylon.
24034004 “ ‘Yet hear the Lord’s promise to you, Zedekiah king of Judah. This is what the Lord says concerning you: You will not die by the sword;
24034005 you will die peacefully. As people made a funeral fire in honor of your predecessors, the kings who ruled before you, so they will make a fire in your honor and lament, “Alas, master!” I myself make this promise, declares the Lord.’ ”
24034006 Then Jeremiah the prophet told all this to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem,
24034007 while the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah that were still holding out—Lachish and Azekah. These were the only fortified cities left in Judah.
24034008 The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for the slaves.
24034009 Everyone was to free their Hebrew slaves, both male and female; no one was to hold a fellow Hebrew in bondage.
24034010 So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage. They agreed, and set them free.
24034011 But afterward they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again.
24034012 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
24034013 “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. I said,
24034014 ‘Every seventh year each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you. After they have served you six years, you must let them go free.’ Your ancestors, however, did not listen to me or pay attention to me.
24034015 Recently you repented and did what is right in my sight: Each of you proclaimed freedom to your own people. You even made a covenant before me in the house that bears my Name.
24034016 But now you have turned around and profaned my name; each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished. You have forced them to become your slaves again.
24034017 “Therefore this is what the Lord says: You have not obeyed me; you have not proclaimed freedom to your own people. So I now proclaim ‘freedom’ for you, declares the Lord—‘freedom’ to fall by the sword, plague and famine. I will make you abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth.
24034018 Those who have violated my covenant and have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant they made before me, I will treat like the calf they cut in two and then walked between its pieces.
24034019 The leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests and all the people of the land who walked between the pieces of the calf,
24034020 I will deliver into the hands of their enemies who want to kill them. Their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals.
24034021 “I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials into the hands of their enemies who want to kill them, to the army of the king of Babylon, which has withdrawn from you.
24034022 I am going to give the order, declares the Lord, and I will bring them back to this city. They will fight against it, take it and burn it down. And I will lay waste the towns of Judah so no one can live there.”
24035001 This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord during the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:
24035002 “Go to the Rekabite family and invite them to come to one of the side rooms of the house of the Lord and give them wine to drink.”
24035003 So I went to get Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons—the whole family of the Rekabites.
24035004 I brought them into the house of the Lord, into the room of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah the man of God. It was next to the room of the officials, which was over that of Maaseiah son of Shallum the doorkeeper.
24035005 Then I set bowls full of wine and some cups before the Rekabites and said to them, “Drink some wine.”
24035006 But they replied, “We do not drink wine, because our forefather Jehonadab son of Rekab gave us this command: ‘Neither you nor your descendants must ever drink wine.
24035007 Also you must never build houses, sow seed or plant vineyards; you must never have any of these things, but must always live in tents. Then you will live a long time in the land where you are nomads.’
24035008 We have obeyed everything our forefather Jehonadab son of Rekab commanded us. Neither we nor our wives nor our sons and daughters have ever drunk wine
24035009 or built houses to live in or had vineyards, fields or crops.
24035010 We have lived in tents and have fully obeyed everything our forefather Jehonadab commanded us.
24035011 But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded this land, we said, ‘Come, we must go to Jerusalem to escape the Babylonian and Aramean armies.’ So we have remained in Jerusalem.”
24035012 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying:
24035013 “This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go and tell the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, ‘Will you not learn a lesson and obey my words?’ declares the Lord.
24035014 ‘Jehonadab son of Rekab ordered his descendants not to drink wine and this command has been kept. To this day they do not drink wine, because they obey their forefather’s command. But I have spoken to you again and again, yet you have not obeyed me.
24035015 Again and again I sent all my servants the prophets to you. They said, “Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and reform your actions; do not follow other gods to serve them. Then you will live in the land I have given to you and your ancestors.” But you have not paid attention or listened to me.
24035016 The descendants of Jehonadab son of Rekab have carried out the command their forefather gave them, but these people have not obeyed me.’
24035017 “Therefore this is what the Lord God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘Listen! I am going to bring on Judah and on everyone living in Jerusalem every disaster I pronounced against them. I spoke to them, but they did not listen; I called to them, but they did not answer.’ ”
24035018 Then Jeremiah said to the family of the Rekabites, “This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘You have obeyed the command of your forefather Jehonadab and have followed all his instructions and have done everything he ordered.’
24035019 Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘Jehonadab son of Rekab will never fail to have a descendant to serve me.’ ”
24036001 In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
24036002 “Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah and all the other nations from the time I began speaking to you in the reign of Josiah till now.
24036003 Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about every disaster I plan to inflict on them, they will each turn from their wicked ways; then I will forgive their wickedness and their sin.”
24036004 So Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and while Jeremiah dictated all the words the Lord had spoken to him, Baruch wrote them on the scroll.
24036005 Then Jeremiah told Baruch, “I am restricted; I am not allowed to go to the Lord’s temple.
24036006 So you go to the house of the Lord on a day of fasting and read to the people from the scroll the words of the Lord that you wrote as I dictated. Read them to all the people of Judah who come in from their towns.
24036007 Perhaps they will bring their petition before the Lord and will each turn from their wicked ways, for the anger and wrath pronounced against this people by the Lord are great.”
24036008 Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do; at the Lord’s temple he read the words of the Lord from the scroll.
24036009 In the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, a time of fasting before the Lord was proclaimed for all the people in Jerusalem and those who had come from the towns of Judah.
24036010 From the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple, Baruch read to all the people at the Lord’s temple the words of Jeremiah from the scroll.
24036011 When Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the Lord from the scroll,
24036012 he went down to the secretary’s room in the royal palace, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Akbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials.
24036013 After Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read to the people from the scroll,
24036014 all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, “Bring the scroll from which you have read to the people and come.” So Baruch son of Neriah went to them with the scroll in his hand.
24036015 They said to him, “Sit down, please, and read it to us.” So Baruch read it to them.
24036016 When they heard all these words, they looked at each other in fear and said to Baruch, “We must report all these words to the king.”
24036017 Then they asked Baruch, “Tell us, how did you come to write all this? Did Jeremiah dictate it?”
24036018 “Yes,” Baruch replied, “he dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them in ink on the scroll.”
24036019 Then the officials said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah, go and hide. Don’t let anyone know where you are.”
24036020 After they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary, they went to the king in the courtyard and reported everything to him.
24036021 The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and Jehudi brought it from the room of Elishama the secretary and read it to the king and all the officials standing beside him.
24036022 It was the ninth month and the king was sitting in the winter apartment, with a fire burning in the firepot in front of him.
24036023 Whenever Jehudi had read three or four columns of the scroll, the king cut them off with a scribe’s knife and threw them into the firepot, until the entire scroll was burned in the fire.
24036024 The king and all his attendants who heard all these words showed no fear, nor did they tear their clothes.
24036025 Even though Elnathan, Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.
24036026 Instead, the king commanded Jerahmeel, a son of the king, Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the Lord had hidden them.
24036027 After the king burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah’s dictation, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
24036028 “Take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned up.
24036029 Also tell Jehoiakim king of Judah, ‘This is what the Lord says: You burned that scroll and said, “Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon would certainly come and destroy this land and wipe from it both man and beast?”
24036030 Therefore this is what the Lord says about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on the throne of David; his body will be thrown out and exposed to the heat by day and the frost by night.
24036031 I will punish him and his children and his attendants for their wickedness; I will bring on them and those living in Jerusalem and the people of Judah every disaster I pronounced against them, because they have not listened.’ ”
24036032 So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on it all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them.
24037001 Zedekiah son of Josiah was made king of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; he reigned in place of Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim.
24037002 Neither he nor his attendants nor the people of the land paid any attention to the words the Lord had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet.
24037003 King Zedekiah, however, sent Jehukal son of Shelemiah with the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah the prophet with this message: “Please pray to the Lord our God for us.”
24037004 Now Jeremiah was free to come and go among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison.
24037005 Pharaoh’s army had marched out of Egypt, and when the Babylonians who were besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.
24037006 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet:
24037007 “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of me, ‘Pharaoh’s army, which has marched out to support you, will go back to its own land, to Egypt.
24037008 Then the Babylonians will return and attack this city; they will capture it and burn it down.’
24037009 “This is what the Lord says: Do not deceive yourselves, thinking, ‘The Babylonians will surely leave us.’ They will not!
24037010 Even if you were to defeat the entire Babylonian army that is attacking you and only wounded men were left in their tents, they would come out and burn this city down.”
24037011 After the Babylonian army had withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army,
24037012 Jeremiah started to leave the city to go to the territory of Benjamin to get his share of the property among the people there.
24037013 But when he reached the Benjamin Gate, the captain of the guard, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, arrested him and said, “You are deserting to the Babylonians!”
24037014 “That’s not true!” Jeremiah said. “I am not deserting to the Babylonians.” But Irijah would not listen to him; instead, he arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.
24037015 They were angry with Jeremiah and had him beaten and imprisoned in the house of Jonathan the secretary, which they had made into a prison.
24037016 Jeremiah was put into a vaulted cell in a dungeon, where he remained a long time.
24037017 Then King Zedekiah sent for him and had him brought to the palace, where he asked him privately, “Is there any word from the Lord?” “Yes,” Jeremiah replied, “you will be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.”
24037018 Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What crime have I committed against you or your attendants or this people, that you have put me in prison?
24037019 Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, ‘The king of Babylon will not attack you or this land’?
24037020 But now, my lord the king, please listen. Let me bring my petition before you: Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, or I will die there.”
24037021 King Zedekiah then gave orders for Jeremiah to be placed in the courtyard of the guard and given a loaf of bread from the street of the bakers each day until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
24038001 Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehukal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malkijah heard what Jeremiah was telling all the people when he said,
24038002 “This is what the Lord says: ‘Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine or plague, but whoever goes over to the Babylonians will live. They will escape with their lives; they will live.’
24038003 And this is what the Lord says: ‘This city will certainly be given into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon, who will capture it.’ ”
24038004 Then the officials said to the king, “This man should be put to death. He is discouraging the soldiers who are left in this city, as well as all the people, by the things he is saying to them. This man is not seeking the good of these people but their ruin.”
24038005 “He is in your hands,” King Zedekiah answered. “The king can do nothing to oppose you.”
24038006 So they took Jeremiah and put him into the cistern of Malkijah, the king’s son, which was in the courtyard of the guard. They lowered Jeremiah by ropes into the cistern; it had no water in it, only mud, and Jeremiah sank down into the mud.
24038007 But Ebed-Melek, a Cushite, an official in the royal palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. While the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate,
24038008 Ebed-Melek went out of the palace and said to him,
24038009 “My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all they have done to Jeremiah the prophet. They have thrown him into a cistern, where he will starve to death when there is no longer any bread in the city.”
24038010 Then the king commanded Ebed-Melek the Cushite, “Take thirty men from here with you and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.”
24038011 So Ebed-Melek took the men with him and went to a room under the treasury in the palace. He took some old rags and worn-out clothes from there and let them down with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.
24038012 Ebed-Melek the Cushite said to Jeremiah, “Put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your arms to pad the ropes.” Jeremiah did so,
24038013 and they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
24038014 Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and had him brought to the third entrance to the temple of the Lord. “I am going to ask you something,” the king said to Jeremiah. “Do not hide anything from me.”
24038015 Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I give you an answer, will you not kill me? Even if I did give you counsel, you would not listen to me.”
24038016 But King Zedekiah swore this oath secretly to Jeremiah: “As surely as the Lord lives, who has given us breath, I will neither kill you nor hand you over to those who want to kill you.”
24038017 Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “This is what the Lord God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down; you and your family will live.
24038018 But if you will not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, this city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians and they will burn it down; you yourself will not escape from them.’ ”
24038019 King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have gone over to the Babylonians, for the Babylonians may hand me over to them and they will mistreat me.”
24038020 “They will not hand you over,” Jeremiah replied. “Obey the Lord by doing what I tell you. Then it will go well with you, and your life will be spared.
24038021 But if you refuse to surrender, this is what the Lord has revealed to me:
24038022 All the women left in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon. Those women will say to you: “ ‘They misled you and overcame you— those trusted friends of yours. Your feet are sunk in the mud; your friends have deserted you.’
24038023 “All your wives and children will be brought out to the Babylonians. You yourself will not escape from their hands but will be captured by the king of Babylon; and this city will be burned down.”
24038024 Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Do not let anyone know about this conversation, or you may die.
24038025 If the officials hear that I talked with you, and they come to you and say, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us or we will kill you,’
24038026 then tell them, ‘I was pleading with the king not to send me back to Jonathan’s house to die there.’ ”
24038027 All the officials did come to Jeremiah and question him, and he told them everything the king had ordered him to say. So they said no more to him, for no one had heard his conversation with the king.
24038028 And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard until the day Jerusalem was captured. This is how Jerusalem was taken:
24039001 In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army and laid siege to it.
24039002 And on the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah’s eleventh year, the city wall was broken through.
24039003 Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came and took seats in the Middle Gate: Nergal-Sharezer of Samgar, Nebo-Sarsekim a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer a high official and all the other officials of the king of Babylon.
24039004 When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled; they left the city at night by way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls, and headed toward the Arabah.
24039005 But the Babylonian army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They captured him and took him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence on him.
24039006 There at Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes and also killed all the nobles of Judah.
24039007 Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him with bronze shackles to take him to Babylon.
24039008 The Babylonians set fire to the royal palace and the houses of the people and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
24039009 Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard carried into exile to Babylon the people who remained in the city, along with those who had gone over to him, and the rest of the people.
24039010 But Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard left behind in the land of Judah some of the poor people, who owned nothing; and at that time he gave them vineyards and fields.
24039011 Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had given these orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard:
24039012 “Take him and look after him; don’t harm him but do for him whatever he asks.”
24039013 So Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard, Nebushazban a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer a high official and all the other officers of the king of Babylon
24039014 sent and had Jeremiah taken out of the courtyard of the guard. They turned him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him back to his home. So he remained among his own people.
24039015 While Jeremiah had been confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of the Lord came to him:
24039016 “Go and tell Ebed-Melek the Cushite, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am about to fulfill my words against this city—words concerning disaster, not prosperity. At that time they will be fulfilled before your eyes.
24039017 But I will rescue you on that day, declares the Lord; you will not be given into the hands of those you fear.
24039018 I will save you; you will not fall by the sword but will escape with your life, because you trust in me, declares the Lord.’ ”
24040001 The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord after Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had released him at Ramah. He had found Jeremiah bound in chains among all the captives from Jerusalem and Judah who were being carried into exile to Babylon.
24040002 When the commander of the guard found Jeremiah, he said to him, “The Lord your God decreed this disaster for this place.
24040003 And now the Lord has brought it about; he has done just as he said he would. All this happened because you people sinned against the Lord and did not obey him.
24040004 But today I am freeing you from the chains on your wrists. Come with me to Babylon, if you like, and I will look after you; but if you do not want to, then don’t come. Look, the whole country lies before you; go wherever you please.”
24040005 However, before Jeremiah turned to go, Nebuzaradan added, “Go back to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the towns of Judah, and live with him among the people, or go anywhere else you please.” Then the commander gave him provisions and a present and let him go.
24040006 So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and stayed with him among the people who were left behind in the land.
24040007 When all the army officers and their men who were still in the open country heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor over the land and had put him in charge of the men, women and children who were the poorest in the land and who had not been carried into exile to Babylon,
24040008 they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maakathite, and their men.
24040009 Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, took an oath to reassure them and their men. “Do not be afraid to serve the Babylonians, ” he said. “Settle down in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you.
24040010 I myself will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians who come to us, but you are to harvest the wine, summer fruit and olive oil, and put them in your storage jars, and live in the towns you have taken over.”
24040011 When all the Jews in Moab, Ammon, Edom and all the other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, as governor over them,
24040012 they all came back to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, from all the countries where they had been scattered. And they harvested an abundance of wine and summer fruit.
24040013 Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers still in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
24040014 and said to him, “Don’t you know that Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did not believe them.
24040015 Then Johanan son of Kareah said privately to Gedaliah in Mizpah, “Let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life and cause all the Jews who are gathered around you to be scattered and the remnant of Judah to perish?”
24040016 But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, “Don’t do such a thing! What you are saying about Ishmael is not true.”
24041001 In the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was of royal blood and had been one of the king’s officers, came with ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. While they were eating together there,
24041002 Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, killing the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land.
24041003 Ishmael also killed all the men of Judah who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Babylonian soldiers who were there.
24041004 The day after Gedaliah’s assassination, before anyone knew about it,
24041005 eighty men who had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes and cut themselves came from Shechem, Shiloh and Samaria, bringing grain offerings and incense with them to the house of the Lord.
24041006 Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he met them, he said, “Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam.”
24041007 When they went into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern.
24041008 But ten of them said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us! We have wheat and barley, olive oil and honey, hidden in a field.” So he let them alone and did not kill them with the others.
24041009 Now the cistern where he threw all the bodies of the men he had killed along with Gedaliah was the one King Asa had made as part of his defense against Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the dead.
24041010 Ishmael made captives of all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah—the king’s daughters along with all the others who were left there, over whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites.
24041011 When Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him heard about all the crimes Ishmael son of Nethaniah had committed,
24041012 they took all their men and went to fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They caught up with him near the great pool in Gibeon.
24041013 When all the people Ishmael had with him saw Johanan son of Kareah and the army officers who were with him, they were glad.
24041014 All the people Ishmael had taken captive at Mizpah turned and went over to Johanan son of Kareah.
24041015 But Ishmael son of Nethaniah and eight of his men escaped from Johanan and fled to the Ammonites.
24041016 Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him led away all the people of Mizpah who had survived, whom Johanan had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after Ishmael had assassinated Gedaliah son of Ahikam—the soldiers, women, children and court officials he had recovered from Gibeon.
24041017 And they went on, stopping at Geruth Kimham near Bethlehem on their way to Egypt
24041018 to escape the Babylonians. They were afraid of them because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land.
24042001 Then all the army officers, including Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest approached
24042002 Jeremiah the prophet and said to him, “Please hear our petition and pray to the Lord your God for this entire remnant. For as you now see, though we were once many, now only a few are left.
24042003 Pray that the Lord your God will tell us where we should go and what we should do.”
24042004 “I have heard you,” replied Jeremiah the prophet. “I will certainly pray to the Lord your God as you have requested; I will tell you everything the Lord says and will keep nothing back from you.”
24042005 Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the Lord be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act in accordance with everything the Lord your God sends you to tell us.
24042006 Whether it is favorable or unfavorable, we will obey the Lord our God, to whom we are sending you, so that it will go well with us, for we will obey the Lord our God.”
24042007 Ten days later the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah.
24042008 So he called together Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him and all the people from the least to the greatest.
24042009 He said to them, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition, says:
24042010 ‘If you stay in this land, I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not uproot you, for I have relented concerning the disaster I have inflicted on you.
24042011 Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you now fear. Do not be afraid of him, declares the Lord, for I am with you and will save you and deliver you from his hands.
24042012 I will show you compassion so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your land.’
24042013 “However, if you say, ‘We will not stay in this land,’ and so disobey the Lord your God,
24042014 and if you say, ‘No, we will go and live in Egypt, where we will not see war or hear the trumpet or be hungry for bread,’
24042015 then hear the word of the Lord, you remnant of Judah. This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you are determined to go to Egypt and you do go to settle there,
24042016 then the sword you fear will overtake you there, and the famine you dread will follow you into Egypt, and there you will die.
24042017 Indeed, all who are determined to go to Egypt to settle there will die by the sword, famine and plague; not one of them will survive or escape the disaster I will bring on them.’
24042018 This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘As my anger and wrath have been poured out on those who lived in Jerusalem, so will my wrath be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. You will be a curse and an object of horror, a curse and an object of reproach; you will never see this place again.’
24042019 “Remnant of Judah, the Lord has told you, ‘Do not go to Egypt.’ Be sure of this: I warn you today
24042020 that you made a fatal mistake when you sent me to the Lord your God and said, ‘Pray to the Lord our God for us; tell us everything he says and we will do it.’
24042021 I have told you today, but you still have not obeyed the Lord your God in all he sent me to tell you.
24042022 So now, be sure of this: You will die by the sword, famine and plague in the place where you want to go to settle.”
24043001 When Jeremiah had finished telling the people all the words of the Lord their God—everything the Lord had sent him to tell them—
24043002 Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, “You are lying! The Lord our God has not sent you to say, ‘You must not go to Egypt to settle there.’
24043003 But Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the Babylonians, so they may kill us or carry us into exile to Babylon.”
24043004 So Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers and all the people disobeyed the Lord’s command to stay in the land of Judah.
24043005 Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers led away all the remnant of Judah who had come back to live in the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been scattered.
24043006 They also led away all those whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan—the men, the women, the children and the king’s daughters. And they took Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah along with them.
24043007 So they entered Egypt in disobedience to the Lord and went as far as Tahpanhes.
24043008 In Tahpanhes the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
24043009 “While the Jews are watching, take some large stones with you and bury them in clay in the brick pavement at the entrance to Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes.
24043010 Then say to them, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I will set his throne over these stones I have buried here; he will spread his royal canopy above them.
24043011 He will come and attack Egypt, bringing death to those destined for death, captivity to those destined for captivity, and the sword to those destined for the sword.
24043012 He will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt; he will burn their temples and take their gods captive. As a shepherd picks his garment clean of lice, so he will pick Egypt clean and depart.
24043013 There in the temple of the sun in Egypt he will demolish the sacred pillars and will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt.’ ”
24044001 This word came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in Lower Egypt—in Migdol, Tahpanhes and Memphis—and in Upper Egypt:
24044002 “This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You saw the great disaster I brought on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah. Today they lie deserted and in ruins
24044003 because of the evil they have done. They aroused my anger by burning incense to and worshiping other gods that neither they nor you nor your ancestors ever knew.
24044004 Again and again I sent my servants the prophets, who said, ‘Do not do this detestable thing that I hate!’
24044005 But they did not listen or pay attention; they did not turn from their wickedness or stop burning incense to other gods.
24044006 Therefore, my fierce anger was poured out; it raged against the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem and made them the desolate ruins they are today.
24044007 “Now this is what the Lord God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Why bring such great disaster on yourselves by cutting off from Judah the men and women, the children and infants, and so leave yourselves without a remnant?
24044008 Why arouse my anger with what your hands have made, burning incense to other gods in Egypt, where you have come to live? You will destroy yourselves and make yourselves a curse and an object of reproach among all the nations on earth.
24044009 Have you forgotten the wickedness committed by your ancestors and by the kings and queens of Judah and the wickedness committed by you and your wives in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem?
24044010 To this day they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence, nor have they followed my law and the decrees I set before you and your ancestors.
24044011 “Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am determined to bring disaster on you and to destroy all Judah.
24044012 I will take away the remnant of Judah who were determined to go to Egypt to settle there. They will all perish in Egypt; they will fall by the sword or die from famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by sword or famine. They will become a curse and an object of horror, a curse and an object of reproach.
24044013 I will punish those who live in Egypt with the sword, famine and plague, as I punished Jerusalem.
24044014 None of the remnant of Judah who have gone to live in Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah, to which they long to return and live; none will return except a few fugitives.”
24044015 Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, along with all the women who were present—a large assembly—and all the people living in Lower and Upper Egypt, said to Jeremiah,
24044016 “We will not listen to the message you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord!
24044017 We will certainly do everything we said we would: We will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and will pour out drink offerings to her just as we and our ancestors, our kings and our officials did in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. At that time we had plenty of food and were well off and suffered no harm.
24044018 But ever since we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have had nothing and have been perishing by sword and famine.”
24044019 The women added, “When we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, did not our husbands know that we were making cakes impressed with her image and pouring out drink offerings to her?”
24044020 Then Jeremiah said to all the people, both men and women, who were answering him,
24044021 “Did not the Lord remember and call to mind the incense burned in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem by you and your ancestors, your kings and your officials and the people of the land?
24044022 When the Lord could no longer endure your wicked actions and the detestable things you did, your land became a curse and a desolate waste without inhabitants, as it is today.
24044023 Because you have burned incense and have sinned against the Lord and have not obeyed him or followed his law or his decrees or his stipulations, this disaster has come upon you, as you now see.”
24044024 Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including the women, “Hear the word of the Lord, all you people of Judah in Egypt.
24044025 This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You and your wives have done what you said you would do when you promised, ‘We will certainly carry out the vows we made to burn incense and pour out drink offerings to the Queen of Heaven.’ “Go ahead then, do what you promised! Keep your vows!
24044026 But hear the word of the Lord, all you Jews living in Egypt: ‘I swear by my great name,’ says the Lord, ‘that no one from Judah living anywhere in Egypt will ever again invoke my name or swear, “As surely as the Sovereign Lord lives.”
24044027 For I am watching over them for harm, not for good; the Jews in Egypt will perish by sword and famine until they are all destroyed.
24044028 Those who escape the sword and return to the land of Judah from Egypt will be very few. Then the whole remnant of Judah who came to live in Egypt will know whose word will stand—mine or theirs.
24044029 “ ‘This will be the sign to you that I will punish you in this place,’ declares the Lord, ‘so that you will know that my threats of harm against you will surely stand.’
24044030 This is what the Lord says: ‘I am going to deliver Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hands of his enemies who want to kill him, just as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the enemy who wanted to kill him.’ ”
24045001 When Baruch son of Neriah wrote on a scroll the words Jeremiah the prophet dictated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, Jeremiah said this to Baruch:
24045002 “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch:
24045003 You said, ‘Woe to me! The Lord has added sorrow to my pain; I am worn out with groaning and find no rest.’
24045004 But the Lord has told me to say to you, ‘This is what the Lord says: I will overthrow what I have built and uproot what I have planted, throughout the earth.
24045005 Should you then seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them. For I will bring disaster on all people, declares the Lord, but wherever you go I will let you escape with your life.’ ”
24046001 This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations:
24046002 Concerning Egypt: This is the message against the army of Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt, which was defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates River by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:
24046003 “Prepare your shields, both large and small, and march out for battle!
24046004 Harness the horses, mount the steeds! Take your positions with helmets on! Polish your spears, put on your armor!
24046005 What do I see? They are terrified, they are retreating, their warriors are defeated. They flee in haste without looking back, and there is terror on every side,” declares the Lord.
24046006 “The swift cannot flee nor the strong escape. In the north by the River Euphrates they stumble and fall.
24046007 “Who is this that rises like the Nile, like rivers of surging waters?
24046008 Egypt rises like the Nile, like rivers of surging waters. She says, ‘I will rise and cover the earth; I will destroy cities and their people.’
24046009 Charge, you horses! Drive furiously, you charioteers! March on, you warriors—men of Cush and Put who carry shields, men of Lydia who draw the bow.
24046010 But that day belongs to the Lord, the Lord Almighty— a day of vengeance, for vengeance on his foes. The sword will devour till it is satisfied, till it has quenched its thirst with blood. For the Lord, the Lord Almighty, will offer sacrifice in the land of the north by the River Euphrates.
24046011 “Go up to Gilead and get balm, Virgin Daughter Egypt. But you try many medicines in vain; there is no healing for you.
24046012 The nations will hear of your shame; your cries will fill the earth. One warrior will stumble over another; both will fall down together.”
24046013 This is the message the Lord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to attack Egypt:
24046014 “Announce this in Egypt, and proclaim it in Migdol; proclaim it also in Memphis and Tahpanhes: ‘Take your positions and get ready, for the sword devours those around you.’
24046015 Why will your warriors be laid low? They cannot stand, for the Lord will push them down.
24046016 They will stumble repeatedly; they will fall over each other. They will say, ‘Get up, let us go back to our own people and our native lands, away from the sword of the oppressor.’
24046017 There they will exclaim, ‘Pharaoh king of Egypt is only a loud noise; he has missed his opportunity.’
24046018 “As surely as I live,” declares the King, whose name is the Lord Almighty, “one will come who is like Tabor among the mountains, like Carmel by the sea.
24046019 Pack your belongings for exile, you who live in Egypt, for Memphis will be laid waste and lie in ruins without inhabitant.
24046020 “Egypt is a beautiful heifer, but a gadfly is coming against her from the north.
24046021 The mercenaries in her ranks are like fattened calves. They too will turn and flee together, they will not stand their ground, for the day of disaster is coming upon them, the time for them to be punished.
24046022 Egypt will hiss like a fleeing serpent as the enemy advances in force; they will come against her with axes, like men who cut down trees.
24046023 They will chop down her forest,” declares the Lord, “dense though it be. They are more numerous than locusts, they cannot be counted.
24046024 Daughter Egypt will be put to shame, given into the hands of the people of the north.”
24046025 The Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “I am about to bring punishment on Amon god of Thebes, on Pharaoh, on Egypt and her gods and her kings, and on those who rely on Pharaoh.
24046026 I will give them into the hands of those who want to kill them—Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers. Later, however, Egypt will be inhabited as in times past,” declares the Lord.
24046027 “Do not be afraid, Jacob my servant; do not be dismayed, Israel. I will surely save you out of a distant place, your descendants from the land of their exile. Jacob will again have peace and security, and no one will make him afraid.
24046028 Do not be afraid, Jacob my servant, for I am with you,” declares the Lord. “Though I completely destroy all the nations among which I scatter you, I will not completely destroy you. I will discipline you but only in due measure; I will not let you go entirely unpunished.”
24047001 This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines before Pharaoh attacked Gaza:
24047002 This is what the Lord says: “See how the waters are rising in the north; they will become an overflowing torrent. They will overflow the land and everything in it, the towns and those who live in them. The people will cry out; all who dwell in the land will wail
24047003 at the sound of the hooves of galloping steeds, at the noise of enemy chariots and the rumble of their wheels. Parents will not turn to help their children; their hands will hang limp.
24047004 For the day has come to destroy all the Philistines and to remove all survivors who could help Tyre and Sidon. The Lord is about to destroy the Philistines, the remnant from the coasts of Caphtor.
24047005 Gaza will shave her head in mourning; Ashkelon will be silenced. You remnant on the plain, how long will you cut yourselves?
24047006 “ ‘Alas, sword of the Lord, how long till you rest? Return to your sheath; cease and be still.’
24047007 But how can it rest when the Lord has commanded it, when he has ordered it to attack Ashkelon and the coast?”
24048001 Concerning Moab: This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “Woe to Nebo, for it will be ruined. Kiriathaim will be disgraced and captured; the stronghold will be disgraced and shattered.
24048002 Moab will be praised no more; in Heshbon people will plot her downfall: ‘Come, let us put an end to that nation.’ You, the people of Madmen, will also be silenced; the sword will pursue you.
24048003 Cries of anguish arise from Horonaim, cries of great havoc and destruction.
24048004 Moab will be broken; her little ones will cry out.
24048005 They go up the hill to Luhith, weeping bitterly as they go; on the road down to Horonaim anguished cries over the destruction are heard.
24048006 Flee! Run for your lives; become like a bush in the desert.
24048007 Since you trust in your deeds and riches, you too will be taken captive, and Chemosh will go into exile, together with his priests and officials.
24048008 The destroyer will come against every town, and not a town will escape. The valley will be ruined and the plateau destroyed, because the Lord has spoken.
24048009 Put salt on Moab, for she will be laid waste ; her towns will become desolate, with no one to live in them.
24048010 “A curse on anyone who is lax in doing the Lord’s work! A curse on anyone who keeps their sword from bloodshed!
24048011 “Moab has been at rest from youth, like wine left on its dregs, not poured from one jar to another— she has not gone into exile. So she tastes as she did, and her aroma is unchanged.
24048012 But days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will send men who pour from pitchers, and they will pour her out; they will empty her pitchers and smash her jars.
24048013 Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, as Israel was ashamed when they trusted in Bethel.
24048014 “How can you say, ‘We are warriors, men valiant in battle’?
24048015 Moab will be destroyed and her towns invaded; her finest young men will go down in the slaughter,” declares the King, whose name is the Lord Almighty.
24048016 “The fall of Moab is at hand; her calamity will come quickly.
24048017 Mourn for her, all who live around her, all who know her fame; say, ‘How broken is the mighty scepter, how broken the glorious staff!’
24048018 “Come down from your glory and sit on the parched ground, you inhabitants of Daughter Dibon, for the one who destroys Moab will come up against you and ruin your fortified cities.
24048019 Stand by the road and watch, you who live in Aroer. Ask the man fleeing and the woman escaping, ask them, ‘What has happened?’
24048020 Moab is disgraced, for she is shattered. Wail and cry out! Announce by the Arnon that Moab is destroyed.
24048021 Judgment has come to the plateau— to Holon, Jahzah and Mephaath,
24048022 to Dibon, Nebo and Beth Diblathaim,
24048023 to Kiriathaim, Beth Gamul and Beth Meon,
24048024 to Kerioth and Bozrah— to all the towns of Moab, far and near.
24048025 Moab’s horn is cut off; her arm is broken,” declares the Lord.
24048026 “Make her drunk, for she has defied the Lord. Let Moab wallow in her vomit; let her be an object of ridicule.
24048027 Was not Israel the object of your ridicule? Was she caught among thieves, that you shake your head in scorn whenever you speak of her?
24048028 Abandon your towns and dwell among the rocks, you who live in Moab. Be like a dove that makes its nest at the mouth of a cave.
24048029 “We have heard of Moab’s pride— how great is her arrogance!— of her insolence, her pride, her conceit and the haughtiness of her heart.
24048030 I know her insolence but it is futile,” declares the Lord, “and her boasts accomplish nothing.
24048031 Therefore I wail over Moab, for all Moab I cry out, I moan for the people of Kir Hareseth.
24048032 I weep for you, as Jazer weeps, you vines of Sibmah. Your branches spread as far as the sea ; they reached as far as Jazer. The destroyer has fallen on your ripened fruit and grapes.
24048033 Joy and gladness are gone from the orchards and fields of Moab. I have stopped the flow of wine from the presses; no one treads them with shouts of joy. Although there are shouts, they are not shouts of joy.
24048034 “The sound of their cry rises from Heshbon to Elealeh and Jahaz, from Zoar as far as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah, for even the waters of Nimrim are dried up.
24048035 In Moab I will put an end to those who make offerings on the high places and burn incense to their gods,” declares the Lord.
24048036 “So my heart laments for Moab like the music of a pipe; it laments like a pipe for the people of Kir Hareseth. The wealth they acquired is gone.
24048037 Every head is shaved and every beard cut off; every hand is slashed and every waist is covered with sackcloth.
24048038 On all the roofs in Moab and in the public squares there is nothing but mourning, for I have broken Moab like a jar that no one wants,” declares the Lord.
24048039 “How shattered she is! How they wail! How Moab turns her back in shame! Moab has become an object of ridicule, an object of horror to all those around her.”
24048040 This is what the Lord says: “Look! An eagle is swooping down, spreading its wings over Moab.
24048041 Kerioth will be captured and the strongholds taken. In that day the hearts of Moab’s warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor.
24048042 Moab will be destroyed as a nation because she defied the Lord.
24048043 Terror and pit and snare await you, you people of Moab,” declares the Lord.
24048044 “Whoever flees from the terror will fall into a pit, whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in a snare; for I will bring on Moab the year of her punishment,” declares the Lord.
24048045 “In the shadow of Heshbon the fugitives stand helpless, for a fire has gone out from Heshbon, a blaze from the midst of Sihon; it burns the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of the noisy boasters.
24048046 Woe to you, Moab! The people of Chemosh are destroyed; your sons are taken into exile and your daughters into captivity.
24048047 “Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab in days to come,” declares the Lord. Here ends the judgment on Moab.
24049001 Concerning the Ammonites: This is what the Lord says: “Has Israel no sons? Has Israel no heir? Why then has Molek taken possession of Gad? Why do his people live in its towns?
24049002 But the days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will sound the battle cry against Rabbah of the Ammonites; it will become a mound of ruins, and its surrounding villages will be set on fire. Then Israel will drive out those who drove her out,” says the Lord.
24049003 “Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is destroyed! Cry out, you inhabitants of Rabbah! Put on sackcloth and mourn; rush here and there inside the walls, for Molek will go into exile, together with his priests and officials.
24049004 Why do you boast of your valleys, boast of your valleys so fruitful? Unfaithful Daughter Ammon, you trust in your riches and say, ‘Who will attack me?’
24049005 I will bring terror on you from all those around you,” declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty. “Every one of you will be driven away, and no one will gather the fugitives.
24049006 “Yet afterward, I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites,” declares the Lord.
24049007 Concerning Edom: This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Is there no longer wisdom in Teman? Has counsel perished from the prudent? Has their wisdom decayed?
24049008 Turn and flee, hide in deep caves, you who live in Dedan, for I will bring disaster on Esau at the time when I punish him.
24049009 If grape pickers came to you, would they not leave a few grapes? If thieves came during the night, would they not steal only as much as they wanted?
24049010 But I will strip Esau bare; I will uncover his hiding places, so that he cannot conceal himself. His armed men are destroyed, also his allies and neighbors, so there is no one to say,
24049011 ‘Leave your fatherless children; I will keep them alive. Your widows too can depend on me.’ ”
24049012 This is what the Lord says: “If those who do not deserve to drink the cup must drink it, why should you go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, but must drink it.
24049013 I swear by myself,” declares the Lord, “that Bozrah will become a ruin and a curse, an object of horror and reproach; and all its towns will be in ruins forever.”
24049014 I have heard a message from the Lord; an envoy was sent to the nations to say, “Assemble yourselves to attack it! Rise up for battle!”
24049015 “Now I will make you small among the nations, despised by mankind.
24049016 The terror you inspire and the pride of your heart have deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rocks, who occupy the heights of the hill. Though you build your nest as high as the eagle’s, from there I will bring you down,” declares the Lord.
24049017 “Edom will become an object of horror; all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff because of all its wounds.
24049018 As Sodom and Gomorrah were overthrown, along with their neighboring towns,” says the Lord, “so no one will live there; no people will dwell in it.
24049019 “Like a lion coming up from Jordan’s thickets to a rich pastureland, I will chase Edom from its land in an instant. Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? Who is like me and who can challenge me? And what shepherd can stand against me?”
24049020 Therefore, hear what the Lord has planned against Edom, what he has purposed against those who live in Teman: The young of the flock will be dragged away; their pasture will be appalled at their fate.
24049021 At the sound of their fall the earth will tremble; their cry will resound to the Red Sea.
24049022 Look! An eagle will soar and swoop down, spreading its wings over Bozrah. In that day the hearts of Edom’s warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor.
24049023 Concerning Damascus: “Hamath and Arpad are dismayed, for they have heard bad news. They are disheartened, troubled like the restless sea.
24049024 Damascus has become feeble, she has turned to flee and panic has gripped her; anguish and pain have seized her, pain like that of a woman in labor.
24049025 Why has the city of renown not been abandoned, the town in which I delight?
24049026 Surely, her young men will fall in the streets; all her soldiers will be silenced in that day,” declares the Lord Almighty.
24049027 “I will set fire to the walls of Damascus; it will consume the fortresses of Ben-Hadad.”
24049028 Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked: This is what the Lord says: “Arise, and attack Kedar and destroy the people of the East.
24049029 Their tents and their flocks will be taken; their shelters will be carried off with all their goods and camels. People will shout to them, ‘Terror on every side!’
24049030 “Flee quickly away! Stay in deep caves, you who live in Hazor,” declares the Lord. “Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has plotted against you; he has devised a plan against you.
24049031 “Arise and attack a nation at ease, which lives in confidence,” declares the Lord, “a nation that has neither gates nor bars; its people live far from danger.
24049032 Their camels will become plunder, and their large herds will be spoils of war. I will scatter to the winds those who are in distant places and will bring disaster on them from every side,” declares the Lord.
24049033 “Hazor will become a haunt of jackals, a desolate place forever. No one will live there; no people will dwell in it.”
24049034 This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, early in the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah:
24049035 This is what the Lord Almighty says: “See, I will break the bow of Elam, the mainstay of their might.
24049036 I will bring against Elam the four winds from the four quarters of heaven; I will scatter them to the four winds, and there will not be a nation where Elam’s exiles do not go.
24049037 I will shatter Elam before their foes, before those who want to kill them; I will bring disaster on them, even my fierce anger,” declares the Lord. “I will pursue them with the sword until I have made an end of them.
24049038 I will set my throne in Elam and destroy her king and officials,” declares the Lord.
24049039 “Yet I will restore the fortunes of Elam in days to come,” declares the Lord.
24050001 This is the word the Lord spoke through Jeremiah the prophet concerning Babylon and the land of the Babylonians :
24050002 “Announce and proclaim among the nations, lift up a banner and proclaim it; keep nothing back, but say, ‘Babylon will be captured; Bel will be put to shame, Marduk filled with terror. Her images will be put to shame and her idols filled with terror.’
24050003 A nation from the north will attack her and lay waste her land. No one will live in it; both people and animals will flee away.
24050004 “In those days, at that time,” declares the Lord, “the people of Israel and the people of Judah together will go in tears to seek the Lord their God.
24050005 They will ask the way to Zion and turn their faces toward it. They will come and bind themselves to the Lord in an everlasting covenant that will not be forgotten.
24050006 “My people have been lost sheep; their shepherds have led them astray and caused them to roam on the mountains. They wandered over mountain and hill and forgot their own resting place.
24050007 Whoever found them devoured them; their enemies said, ‘We are not guilty, for they sinned against the Lord, their verdant pasture, the Lord, the hope of their ancestors.’
24050008 “Flee out of Babylon; leave the land of the Babylonians, and be like the goats that lead the flock.
24050009 For I will stir up and bring against Babylon an alliance of great nations from the land of the north. They will take up their positions against her, and from the north she will be captured. Their arrows will be like skilled warriors who do not return empty-handed.
24050010 So Babylonia will be plundered; all who plunder her will have their fill,” declares the Lord.
24050011 “Because you rejoice and are glad, you who pillage my inheritance, because you frolic like a heifer threshing grain and neigh like stallions,
24050012 your mother will be greatly ashamed; she who gave you birth will be disgraced. She will be the least of the nations— a wilderness, a dry land, a desert.
24050013 Because of the Lord’s anger she will not be inhabited but will be completely desolate. All who pass Babylon will be appalled; they will scoff because of all her wounds.
24050014 “Take up your positions around Babylon, all you who draw the bow. Shoot at her! Spare no arrows, for she has sinned against the Lord.
24050015 Shout against her on every side! She surrenders, her towers fall, her walls are torn down. Since this is the vengeance of the Lord, take vengeance on her; do to her as she has done to others.
24050016 Cut off from Babylon the sower, and the reaper with his sickle at harvest. Because of the sword of the oppressor let everyone return to their own people, let everyone flee to their own land.
24050017 “Israel is a scattered flock that lions have chased away. The first to devour them was the king of Assyria; the last to crush their bones was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.”
24050018 Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “I will punish the king of Babylon and his land as I punished the king of Assyria.
24050019 But I will bring Israel back to their own pasture, and they will graze on Carmel and Bashan; their appetite will be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead.
24050020 In those days, at that time,” declares the Lord, “search will be made for Israel’s guilt, but there will be none, and for the sins of Judah, but none will be found, for I will forgive the remnant I spare.
24050021 “Attack the land of Merathaim and those who live in Pekod. Pursue, kill and completely destroy them,” declares the Lord. “Do everything I have commanded you.
24050022 The noise of battle is in the land, the noise of great destruction!
24050023 How broken and shattered is the hammer of the whole earth! How desolate is Babylon among the nations!
24050024 I set a trap for you, Babylon, and you were caught before you knew it; you were found and captured because you opposed the Lord.
24050025 The Lord has opened his arsenal and brought out the weapons of his wrath, for the Sovereign Lord Almighty has work to do in the land of the Babylonians.
24050026 Come against her from afar. Break open her granaries; pile her up like heaps of grain. Completely destroy her and leave her no remnant.
24050027 Kill all her young bulls; let them go down to the slaughter! Woe to them! For their day has come, the time for them to be punished.
24050028 Listen to the fugitives and refugees from Babylon declaring in Zion how the Lord our God has taken vengeance, vengeance for his temple.
24050029 “Summon archers against Babylon, all those who draw the bow. Encamp all around her; let no one escape. Repay her for her deeds; do to her as she has done. For she has defied the Lord, the Holy One of Israel.
24050030 Therefore, her young men will fall in the streets; all her soldiers will be silenced in that day,” declares the Lord.
24050031 “See, I am against you, you arrogant one,” declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty, “for your day has come, the time for you to be punished.
24050032 The arrogant one will stumble and fall and no one will help her up; I will kindle a fire in her towns that will consume all who are around her.”
24050033 This is what the Lord Almighty says: “The people of Israel are oppressed, and the people of Judah as well. All their captors hold them fast, refusing to let them go.
24050034 Yet their Redeemer is strong; the Lord Almighty is his name. He will vigorously defend their cause so that he may bring rest to their land, but unrest to those who live in Babylon.
24050035 “A sword against the Babylonians!” declares the Lord— “against those who live in Babylon and against her officials and wise men!
24050036 A sword against her false prophets! They will become fools. A sword against her warriors! They will be filled with terror.
24050037 A sword against her horses and chariots and all the foreigners in her ranks! They will become weaklings. A sword against her treasures! They will be plundered.
24050038 A drought on her waters! They will dry up. For it is a land of idols, idols that will go mad with terror.
24050039 “So desert creatures and hyenas will live there, and there the owl will dwell. It will never again be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation.
24050040 As I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah along with their neighboring towns,” declares the Lord, “so no one will live there; no people will dwell in it.
24050041 “Look! An army is coming from the north; a great nation and many kings are being stirred up from the ends of the earth.
24050042 They are armed with bows and spears; they are cruel and without mercy. They sound like the roaring sea as they ride on their horses; they come like men in battle formation to attack you, Daughter Babylon.
24050043 The king of Babylon has heard reports about them, and his hands hang limp. Anguish has gripped him, pain like that of a woman in labor.
24050044 Like a lion coming up from Jordan’s thickets to a rich pastureland, I will chase Babylon from its land in an instant. Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? Who is like me and who can challenge me? And what shepherd can stand against me?”
24050045 Therefore, hear what the Lord has planned against Babylon, what he has purposed against the land of the Babylonians: The young of the flock will be dragged away; their pasture will be appalled at their fate.
24050046 At the sound of Babylon’s capture the earth will tremble; its cry will resound among the nations.
24051001 This is what the Lord says: “See, I will stir up the spirit of a destroyer against Babylon and the people of Leb Kamai.
24051002 I will send foreigners to Babylon to winnow her and to devastate her land; they will oppose her on every side in the day of her disaster.
24051003 Let not the archer string his bow, nor let him put on his armor. Do not spare her young men; completely destroy her army.
24051004 They will fall down slain in Babylon, fatally wounded in her streets.
24051005 For Israel and Judah have not been forsaken by their God, the Lord Almighty, though their land is full of guilt before the Holy One of Israel.
24051006 “Flee from Babylon! Run for your lives! Do not be destroyed because of her sins. It is time for the Lord’s vengeance; he will repay her what she deserves.
24051007 Babylon was a gold cup in the Lord’s hand; she made the whole earth drunk. The nations drank her wine; therefore they have now gone mad.
24051008 Babylon will suddenly fall and be broken. Wail over her! Get balm for her pain; perhaps she can be healed.
24051009 “ ‘We would have healed Babylon, but she cannot be healed; let us leave her and each go to our own land, for her judgment reaches to the skies, it rises as high as the heavens.’
24051010 “ ‘The Lord has vindicated us; come, let us tell in Zion what the Lord our God has done.’
24051011 “Sharpen the arrows, take up the shields! The Lord has stirred up the kings of the Medes, because his purpose is to destroy Babylon. The Lord will take vengeance, vengeance for his temple.
24051012 Lift up a banner against the walls of Babylon! Reinforce the guard, station the watchmen, prepare an ambush! The Lord will carry out his purpose, his decree against the people of Babylon.
24051013 You who live by many waters and are rich in treasures, your end has come, the time for you to be destroyed.
24051014 The Lord Almighty has sworn by himself: I will surely fill you with troops, as with a swarm of locusts, and they will shout in triumph over you.
24051015 “He made the earth by his power; he founded the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding.
24051016 When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar; he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses.
24051017 “Everyone is senseless and without knowledge; every goldsmith is shamed by his idols. The images he makes are a fraud; they have no breath in them.
24051018 They are worthless, the objects of mockery; when their judgment comes, they will perish.
24051019 He who is the Portion of Jacob is not like these, for he is the Maker of all things, including the people of his inheritance— the Lord Almighty is his name.
24051020 “You are my war club, my weapon for battle— with you I shatter nations, with you I destroy kingdoms,
24051021 with you I shatter horse and rider, with you I shatter chariot and driver,
24051022 with you I shatter man and woman, with you I shatter old man and youth, with you I shatter young man and young woman,
24051023 with you I shatter shepherd and flock, with you I shatter farmer and oxen, with you I shatter governors and officials.
24051024 “Before your eyes I will repay Babylon and all who live in Babylonia for all the wrong they have done in Zion,” declares the Lord.
24051025 “I am against you, you destroying mountain, you who destroy the whole earth,” declares the Lord. “I will stretch out my hand against you, roll you off the cliffs, and make you a burned-out mountain.
24051026 No rock will be taken from you for a cornerstone, nor any stone for a foundation, for you will be desolate forever,” declares the Lord.
24051027 “Lift up a banner in the land! Blow the trumpet among the nations! Prepare the nations for battle against her; summon against her these kingdoms: Ararat, Minni and Ashkenaz. Appoint a commander against her; send up horses like a swarm of locusts.
24051028 Prepare the nations for battle against her— the kings of the Medes, their governors and all their officials, and all the countries they rule.
24051029 The land trembles and writhes, for the Lord’s purposes against Babylon stand— to lay waste the land of Babylon so that no one will live there.
24051030 Babylon’s warriors have stopped fighting; they remain in their strongholds. Their strength is exhausted; they have become weaklings. Her dwellings are set on fire; the bars of her gates are broken.
24051031 One courier follows another and messenger follows messenger to announce to the king of Babylon that his entire city is captured,
24051032 the river crossings seized, the marshes set on fire, and the soldiers terrified.”
24051033 This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “Daughter Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time it is trampled; the time to harvest her will soon come.”
24051034 “Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devoured us, he has thrown us into confusion, he has made us an empty jar. Like a serpent he has swallowed us and filled his stomach with our delicacies, and then has spewed us out.
24051035 May the violence done to our flesh be on Babylon,” say the inhabitants of Zion. “May our blood be on those who live in Babylonia,” says Jerusalem.
24051036 Therefore this is what the Lord says: “See, I will defend your cause and avenge you; I will dry up her sea and make her springs dry.
24051037 Babylon will be a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals, an object of horror and scorn, a place where no one lives.
24051038 Her people all roar like young lions, they growl like lion cubs.
24051039 But while they are aroused, I will set out a feast for them and make them drunk, so that they shout with laughter— then sleep forever and not awake,” declares the Lord.
24051040 “I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams and goats.
24051041 “How Sheshak will be captured, the boast of the whole earth seized! How desolate Babylon will be among the nations!
24051042 The sea will rise over Babylon; its roaring waves will cover her.
24051043 Her towns will be desolate, a dry and desert land, a land where no one lives, through which no one travels.
24051044 I will punish Bel in Babylon and make him spew out what he has swallowed. The nations will no longer stream to him. And the wall of Babylon will fall.
24051045 “Come out of her, my people! Run for your lives! Run from the fierce anger of the Lord.
24051046 Do not lose heart or be afraid when rumors are heard in the land; one rumor comes this year, another the next, rumors of violence in the land and of ruler against ruler.
24051047 For the time will surely come when I will punish the idols of Babylon; her whole land will be disgraced and her slain will all lie fallen within her.
24051048 Then heaven and earth and all that is in them will shout for joy over Babylon, for out of the north destroyers will attack her,” declares the Lord.
24051049 “Babylon must fall because of Israel’s slain, just as the slain in all the earth have fallen because of Babylon.
24051050 You who have escaped the sword, leave and do not linger! Remember the Lord in a distant land, and call to mind Jerusalem.”
24051051 “We are disgraced, for we have been insulted and shame covers our faces, because foreigners have entered the holy places of the Lord’s house.”
24051052 “But days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will punish her idols, and throughout her land the wounded will groan.
24051053 Even if Babylon ascends to the heavens and fortifies her lofty stronghold, I will send destroyers against her,” declares the Lord.
24051054 “The sound of a cry comes from Babylon, the sound of great destruction from the land of the Babylonians.
24051055 The Lord will destroy Babylon; he will silence her noisy din. Waves of enemies will rage like great waters; the roar of their voices will resound.
24051056 A destroyer will come against Babylon; her warriors will be captured, and their bows will be broken. For the Lord is a God of retribution; he will repay in full.
24051057 I will make her officials and wise men drunk, her governors, officers and warriors as well; they will sleep forever and not awake,” declares the King, whose name is the Lord Almighty.
24051058 This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Babylon’s thick wall will be leveled and her high gates set on fire; the peoples exhaust themselves for nothing, the nations’ labor is only fuel for the flames.”
24051059 This is the message Jeremiah the prophet gave to the staff officer Seraiah son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went to Babylon with Zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth year of his reign.
24051060 Jeremiah had written on a scroll about all the disasters that would come upon Babylon—all that had been recorded concerning Babylon.
24051061 He said to Seraiah, “When you get to Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud.
24051062 Then say, ‘Lord, you have said you will destroy this place, so that neither people nor animals will live in it; it will be desolate forever.’
24051063 When you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates.
24051064 Then say, ‘So will Babylon sink to rise no more because of the disaster I will bring on her. And her people will fall.’ ” The words of Jeremiah end here.
24052001 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.
24052002 He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, just as Jehoiakim had done.
24052003 It was because of the Lord’s anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah, and in the end he thrust them from his presence. Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
24052004 So in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. They encamped outside the city and built siege works all around it.
24052005 The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
24052006 By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city had become so severe that there was no food for the people to eat.
24052007 Then the city wall was broken through, and the whole army fled. They left the city at night through the gate between the two walls near the king’s garden, though the Babylonians were surrounding the city. They fled toward the Arabah,
24052008 but the Babylonian army pursued King Zedekiah and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his soldiers were separated from him and scattered,
24052009 and he was captured. He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence on him.
24052010 There at Riblah the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; he also killed all the officials of Judah.
24052011 Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon, where he put him in prison till the day of his death.
24052012 On the tenth day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard, who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.
24052013 He set fire to the temple of the Lord, the royal palace and all the houses of Jerusalem. Every important building he burned down.
24052014 The whole Babylonian army, under the commander of the imperial guard, broke down all the walls around Jerusalem.
24052015 Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard carried into exile some of the poorest people and those who remained in the city, along with the rest of the craftsmen and those who had deserted to the king of Babylon.
24052016 But Nebuzaradan left behind the rest of the poorest people of the land to work the vineyards and fields.
24052017 The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the movable stands and the bronze Sea that were at the temple of the Lord and they carried all the bronze to Babylon.
24052018 They also took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and all the bronze articles used in the temple service.
24052019 The commander of the imperial guard took away the basins, censers, sprinkling bowls, pots, lampstands, dishes and bowls used for drink offerings—all that were made of pure gold or silver.
24052020 The bronze from the two pillars, the Sea and the twelve bronze bulls under it, and the movable stands, which King Solomon had made for the temple of the Lord, was more than could be weighed.
24052021 Each pillar was eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference ; each was four fingers thick, and hollow.
24052022 The bronze capital on top of one pillar was five cubits high and was decorated with a network and pomegranates of bronze all around. The other pillar, with its pomegranates, was similar.
24052023 There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; the total number of pomegranates above the surrounding network was a hundred.
24052024 The commander of the guard took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank and the three doorkeepers.
24052025 Of those still in the city, he took the officer in charge of the fighting men, and seven royal advisers. He also took the secretary who was chief officer in charge of conscripting the people of the land, sixty of whom were found in the city.
24052026 Nebuzaradan the commander took them all and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
24052027 There at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king had them executed. So Judah went into captivity, away from her land.
24052028 This is the number of the people Nebuchadnezzar carried into exile: in the seventh year, 3,023 Jews;
24052029 in Nebuchadnezzar’s eighteenth year, 832 people from Jerusalem;
24052030 in his twenty-third year, 745 Jews taken into exile by Nebuzaradan the commander of the imperial guard. There were 4,600 people in all.
24052031 In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the year Awel-Marduk became king of Babylon, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, he released Jehoiachin king of Judah and freed him from prison.
24052032 He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.
24052033 So Jehoiachin put aside his prison clothes and for the rest of his life ate regularly at the king’s table.
24052034 Day by day the king of Babylon gave Jehoiachin a regular allowance as long as he lived, till the day of his death.
25001001 How deserted lies the city, once so full of people! How like a widow is she, who once was great among the nations! She who was queen among the provinces has now become a slave.
25001002 Bitterly she weeps at night, tears are on her cheeks. Among all her lovers there is no one to comfort her. All her friends have betrayed her; they have become her enemies.
25001003 After affliction and harsh labor, Judah has gone into exile. She dwells among the nations; she finds no resting place. All who pursue her have overtaken her in the midst of her distress.
25001004 The roads to Zion mourn, for no one comes to her appointed festivals. All her gateways are desolate, her priests groan, her young women grieve, and she is in bitter anguish.
25001005 Her foes have become her masters; her enemies are at ease. The Lord has brought her grief because of her many sins. Her children have gone into exile, captive before the foe.
25001006 All the splendor has departed from Daughter Zion. Her princes are like deer that find no pasture; in weakness they have fled before the pursuer.
25001007 In the days of her affliction and wandering Jerusalem remembers all the treasures that were hers in days of old. When her people fell into enemy hands, there was no one to help her. Her enemies looked at her and laughed at her destruction.
25001008 Jerusalem has sinned greatly and so has become unclean. All who honored her despise her, for they have all seen her naked; she herself groans and turns away.
25001009 Her filthiness clung to her skirts; she did not consider her future. Her fall was astounding; there was none to comfort her. “Look, Lord, on my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed.”
25001010 The enemy laid hands on all her treasures; she saw pagan nations enter her sanctuary— those you had forbidden to enter your assembly.
25001011 All her people groan as they search for bread; they barter their treasures for food to keep themselves alive. “Look, Lord, and consider, for I am despised.”
25001012 “Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look around and see. Is any suffering like my suffering that was inflicted on me, that the Lord brought on me in the day of his fierce anger?
25001013 “From on high he sent fire, sent it down into my bones. He spread a net for my feet and turned me back. He made me desolate, faint all the day long.
25001014 “My sins have been bound into a yoke ; by his hands they were woven together. They have been hung on my neck, and the Lord has sapped my strength. He has given me into the hands of those I cannot withstand.
25001015 “The Lord has rejected all the warriors in my midst; he has summoned an army against me to crush my young men. In his winepress the Lord has trampled Virgin Daughter Judah.
25001016 “This is why I weep and my eyes overflow with tears. No one is near to comfort me, no one to restore my spirit. My children are destitute because the enemy has prevailed.”
25001017 Zion stretches out her hands, but there is no one to comfort her. The Lord has decreed for Jacob that his neighbors become his foes; Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them.
25001018 “The Lord is righteous, yet I rebelled against his command. Listen, all you peoples; look on my suffering. My young men and young women have gone into exile.
25001019 “I called to my allies but they betrayed me. My priests and my elders perished in the city while they searched for food to keep themselves alive.
25001020 “See, Lord, how distressed I am! I am in torment within, and in my heart I am disturbed, for I have been most rebellious. Outside, the sword bereaves; inside, there is only death.
25001021 “People have heard my groaning, but there is no one to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my distress; they rejoice at what you have done. May you bring the day you have announced so they may become like me.
25001022 “Let all their wickedness come before you; deal with them as you have dealt with me because of all my sins. My groans are many and my heart is faint.”
25002001 How the Lord has covered Daughter Zion with the cloud of his anger ! He has hurled down the splendor of Israel from heaven to earth; he has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.
25002002 Without pity the Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob; in his wrath he has torn down the strongholds of Daughter Judah. He has brought her kingdom and its princes down to the ground in dishonor.
25002003 In fierce anger he has cut off every horn of Israel. He has withdrawn his right hand at the approach of the enemy. He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire that consumes everything around it.
25002004 Like an enemy he has strung his bow; his right hand is ready. Like a foe he has slain all who were pleasing to the eye; he has poured out his wrath like fire on the tent of Daughter Zion.
25002005 The Lord is like an enemy; he has swallowed up Israel. He has swallowed up all her palaces and destroyed her strongholds. He has multiplied mourning and lamentation for Daughter Judah.
25002006 He has laid waste his dwelling like a garden; he has destroyed his place of meeting. The Lord has made Zion forget her appointed festivals and her Sabbaths; in his fierce anger he has spurned both king and priest.
25002007 The Lord has rejected his altar and abandoned his sanctuary. He has given the walls of her palaces into the hands of the enemy; they have raised a shout in the house of the Lord as on the day of an appointed festival.
25002008 The Lord determined to tear down the wall around Daughter Zion. He stretched out a measuring line and did not withhold his hand from destroying. He made ramparts and walls lament; together they wasted away.
25002009 Her gates have sunk into the ground; their bars he has broken and destroyed. Her king and her princes are exiled among the nations, the law is no more, and her prophets no longer find visions from the Lord.
25002010 The elders of Daughter Zion sit on the ground in silence; they have sprinkled dust on their heads and put on sackcloth. The young women of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground.
25002011 My eyes fail from weeping, I am in torment within; my heart is poured out on the ground because my people are destroyed, because children and infants faint in the streets of the city.
25002012 They say to their mothers, “Where is bread and wine?” as they faint like the wounded in the streets of the city, as their lives ebb away in their mothers’ arms.
25002013 What can I say for you? With what can I compare you, Daughter Jerusalem? To what can I liken you, that I may comfort you, Virgin Daughter Zion? Your wound is as deep as the sea. Who can heal you?
25002014 The visions of your prophets were false and worthless; they did not expose your sin to ward off your captivity. The prophecies they gave you were false and misleading.
25002015 All who pass your way clap their hands at you; they scoff and shake their heads at Daughter Jerusalem: “Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?”
25002016 All your enemies open their mouths wide against you; they scoff and gnash their teeth and say, “We have swallowed her up. This is the day we have waited for; we have lived to see it.”
25002017 The Lord has done what he planned; he has fulfilled his word, which he decreed long ago. He has overthrown you without pity, he has let the enemy gloat over you, he has exalted the horn of your foes.
25002018 The hearts of the people cry out to the Lord. You walls of Daughter Zion, let your tears flow like a river day and night; give yourself no relief, your eyes no rest.
25002019 Arise, cry out in the night, as the watches of the night begin; pour out your heart like water in the presence of the Lord. Lift up your hands to him for the lives of your children, who faint from hunger at every street corner.
25002020 “Look, Lord, and consider: Whom have you ever treated like this? Should women eat their offspring, the children they have cared for? Should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?
25002021 “Young and old lie together in the dust of the streets; my young men and young women have fallen by the sword. You have slain them in the day of your anger; you have slaughtered them without pity.
25002022 “As you summon to a feast day, so you summoned against me terrors on every side. In the day of the Lord’s anger no one escaped or survived; those I cared for and reared my enemy has destroyed.”
25003001 I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of the Lord’s wrath.
25003002 He has driven me away and made me walk in darkness rather than light;
25003003 indeed, he has turned his hand against me again and again, all day long.
25003004 He has made my skin and my flesh grow old and has broken my bones.
25003005 He has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.
25003006 He has made me dwell in darkness like those long dead.
25003007 He has walled me in so I cannot escape; he has weighed me down with chains.
25003008 Even when I call out or cry for help, he shuts out my prayer.
25003009 He has barred my way with blocks of stone; he has made my paths crooked.
25003010 Like a bear lying in wait, like a lion in hiding,
25003011 he dragged me from the path and mangled me and left me without help.
25003012 He drew his bow and made me the target for his arrows.
25003013 He pierced my heart with arrows from his quiver.
25003014 I became the laughingstock of all my people; they mock me in song all day long.
25003015 He has filled me with bitter herbs and given me gall to drink.
25003016 He has broken my teeth with gravel; he has trampled me in the dust.
25003017 I have been deprived of peace; I have forgotten what prosperity is.
25003018 So I say, “My splendor is gone and all that I had hoped from the Lord.”
25003019 I remember my affliction and my wandering, the bitterness and the gall.
25003020 I well remember them, and my soul is downcast within me.
25003021 Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope:
25003022 Because of the Lord’s great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail.
25003023 They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.
25003024 I say to myself, “The Lord is my portion; therefore I will wait for him.”
25003025 The Lord is good to those whose hope is in him, to the one who seeks him;
25003026 it is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord.
25003027 It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young.
25003028 Let him sit alone in silence, for the Lord has laid it on him.
25003029 Let him bury his face in the dust— there may yet be hope.
25003030 Let him offer his cheek to one who would strike him, and let him be filled with disgrace.
25003031 For no one is cast off by the Lord forever.
25003032 Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his unfailing love.
25003033 For he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to anyone.
25003034 To crush underfoot all prisoners in the land,
25003035 to deny people their rights before the Most High,
25003036 to deprive them of justice— would not the Lord see such things?
25003037 Who can speak and have it happen if the Lord has not decreed it?
25003038 Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that both calamities and good things come?
25003039 Why should the living complain when punished for their sins?
25003040 Let us examine our ways and test them, and let us return to the Lord.
25003041 Let us lift up our hearts and our hands to God in heaven, and say:
25003042 “We have sinned and rebelled and you have not forgiven.
25003043 “You have covered yourself with anger and pursued us; you have slain without pity.
25003044 You have covered yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can get through.
25003045 You have made us scum and refuse among the nations.
25003046 “All our enemies have opened their mouths wide against us.
25003047 We have suffered terror and pitfalls, ruin and destruction.”
25003048 Streams of tears flow from my eyes because my people are destroyed.
25003049 My eyes will flow unceasingly, without relief,
25003050 until the Lord looks down from heaven and sees.
25003051 What I see brings grief to my soul because of all the women of my city.
25003052 Those who were my enemies without cause hunted me like a bird.
25003053 They tried to end my life in a pit and threw stones at me;
25003054 the waters closed over my head, and I thought I was about to perish.
25003055 I called on your name, Lord, from the depths of the pit.
25003056 You heard my plea: “Do not close your ears to my cry for relief.”
25003057 You came near when I called you, and you said, “Do not fear.”
25003058 You, Lord, took up my case; you redeemed my life.
25003059 Lord, you have seen the wrong done to me. Uphold my cause!
25003060 You have seen the depth of their vengeance, all their plots against me.
25003061 Lord, you have heard their insults, all their plots against me—
25003062 what my enemies whisper and mutter against me all day long.
25003063 Look at them! Sitting or standing, they mock me in their songs.
25003064 Pay them back what they deserve, Lord, for what their hands have done.
25003065 Put a veil over their hearts, and may your curse be on them!
25003066 Pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the heavens of the Lord.
25004001 How the gold has lost its luster, the fine gold become dull! The sacred gems are scattered at every street corner.
25004002 How the precious children of Zion, once worth their weight in gold, are now considered as pots of clay, the work of a potter’s hands!
25004003 Even jackals offer their breasts to nurse their young, but my people have become heartless like ostriches in the desert.
25004004 Because of thirst the infant’s tongue sticks to the roof of its mouth; the children beg for bread, but no one gives it to them.
25004005 Those who once ate delicacies are destitute in the streets. Those brought up in royal purple now lie on ash heaps.
25004006 The punishment of my people is greater than that of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment without a hand turned to help her.
25004007 Their princes were brighter than snow and whiter than milk, their bodies more ruddy than rubies, their appearance like lapis lazuli.
25004008 But now they are blacker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled on their bones; it has become as dry as a stick.
25004009 Those killed by the sword are better off than those who die of famine; racked with hunger, they waste away for lack of food from the field.
25004010 With their own hands compassionate women have cooked their own children, who became their food when my people were destroyed.
25004011 The Lord has given full vent to his wrath; he has poured out his fierce anger. He kindled a fire in Zion that consumed her foundations.
25004012 The kings of the earth did not believe, nor did any of the peoples of the world, that enemies and foes could enter the gates of Jerusalem.
25004013 But it happened because of the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed within her the blood of the righteous.
25004014 Now they grope through the streets as if they were blind. They are so defiled with blood that no one dares to touch their garments.
25004015 “Go away! You are unclean!” people cry to them. “Away! Away! Don’t touch us!” When they flee and wander about, people among the nations say, “They can stay here no longer.”
25004016 The Lord himself has scattered them; he no longer watches over them. The priests are shown no honor, the elders no favor.
25004017 Moreover, our eyes failed, looking in vain for help; from our towers we watched for a nation that could not save us.
25004018 People stalked us at every step, so we could not walk in our streets. Our end was near, our days were numbered, for our end had come.
25004019 Our pursuers were swifter than eagles in the sky; they chased us over the mountains and lay in wait for us in the desert.
25004020 The Lord’s anointed, our very life breath, was caught in their traps. We thought that under his shadow we would live among the nations.
25004021 Rejoice and be glad, Daughter Edom, you who live in the land of Uz. But to you also the cup will be passed; you will be drunk and stripped naked.
25004022 Your punishment will end, Daughter Zion; he will not prolong your exile. But he will punish your sin, Daughter Edom, and expose your wickedness.
25005001 Remember, Lord, what has happened to us; look, and see our disgrace.
25005002 Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our homes to foreigners.
25005003 We have become fatherless, our mothers are widows.
25005004 We must buy the water we drink; our wood can be had only at a price.
25005005 Those who pursue us are at our heels; we are weary and find no rest.
25005006 We submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread.
25005007 Our ancestors sinned and are no more, and we bear their punishment.
25005008 Slaves rule over us, and there is no one to free us from their hands.
25005009 We get our bread at the risk of our lives because of the sword in the desert.
25005010 Our skin is hot as an oven, feverish from hunger.
25005011 Women have been violated in Zion, and virgins in the towns of Judah.
25005012 Princes have been hung up by their hands; elders are shown no respect.
25005013 Young men toil at the millstones; boys stagger under loads of wood.
25005014 The elders are gone from the city gate; the young men have stopped their music.
25005015 Joy is gone from our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning.
25005016 The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned!
25005017 Because of this our hearts are faint, because of these things our eyes grow dim
25005018 for Mount Zion, which lies desolate, with jackals prowling over it.
25005019 You, Lord, reign forever; your throne endures from generation to generation.
25005020 Why do you always forget us? Why do you forsake us so long?
25005021 Restore us to yourself, Lord, that we may return; renew our days as of old
25005022 unless you have utterly rejected us and are angry with us beyond measure.
26001001 In my thirtieth year, in the fourth month on the fifth day, while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.
26001002 On the fifth of the month—it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin—
26001003 the word of the Lord came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, by the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians. There the hand of the Lord was on him.
26001004 I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north—an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal,
26001005 and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was human,
26001006 but each of them had four faces and four wings.
26001007 Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze.
26001008 Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four of them had faces and wings,
26001009 and the wings of one touched the wings of another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.
26001010 Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a human being, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle.
26001011 Such were their faces. They each had two wings spreading out upward, each wing touching that of the creature on either side; and each had two other wings covering its body.
26001012 Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went.
26001013 The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it.
26001014 The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.
26001015 As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.
26001016 This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like topaz, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel.
26001017 As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not change direction as the creatures went.
26001018 Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.
26001019 When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose.
26001020 Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
26001021 When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
26001022 Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked something like a vault, sparkling like crystal, and awesome.
26001023 Under the vault their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body.
26001024 When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty, like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.
26001025 Then there came a voice from above the vault over their heads as they stood with lowered wings.
26001026 Above the vault over their heads was what looked like a throne of lapis lazuli, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man.
26001027 I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him.
26001028 Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.
26002001 He said to me, “Son of man, stand up on your feet and I will speak to you.”
26002002 As he spoke, the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet, and I heard him speaking to me.
26002003 He said: “Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me; they and their ancestors have been in revolt against me to this very day.
26002004 The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and stubborn. Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says.’
26002005 And whether they listen or fail to listen—for they are a rebellious people—they will know that a prophet has been among them.
26002006 And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns are all around you and you live among scorpions. Do not be afraid of what they say or be terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people.
26002007 You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or fail to listen, for they are rebellious.
26002008 But you, son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not rebel like that rebellious people; open your mouth and eat what I give you.”
26002009 Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll,
26002010 which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe.
26003001 And he said to me, “Son of man, eat what is before you, eat this scroll; then go and speak to the people of Israel.”
26003002 So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat.
26003003 Then he said to me, “Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving you and fill your stomach with it.” So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.
26003004 He then said to me: “Son of man, go now to the people of Israel and speak my words to them.
26003005 You are not being sent to a people of obscure speech and strange language, but to the people of Israel—
26003006 not to many peoples of obscure speech and strange language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you.
26003007 But the people of Israel are not willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to me, for all the Israelites are hardened and obstinate.
26003008 But I will make you as unyielding and hardened as they are.
26003009 I will make your forehead like the hardest stone, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people.”
26003010 And he said to me, “Son of man, listen carefully and take to heart all the words I speak to you.
26003011 Go now to your people in exile and speak to them. Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says,’ whether they listen or fail to listen.”
26003012 Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a loud rumbling sound as the glory of the Lord rose from the place where it was standing.
26003013 It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound.
26003014 The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of the Lord on me.
26003015 I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Aviv near the Kebar River. And there, where they were living, I sat among them for seven days—deeply distressed.
26003016 At the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me:
26003017 “Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me.
26003018 When I say to a wicked person, ‘You will surely die,’ and you do not warn them or speak out to dissuade them from their evil ways in order to save their life, that wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood.
26003019 But if you do warn the wicked person and they do not turn from their wickedness or from their evil ways, they will die for their sin; but you will have saved yourself.
26003020 “Again, when a righteous person turns from their righteousness and does evil, and I put a stumbling block before them, they will die. Since you did not warn them, they will die for their sin. The righteous things that person did will not be remembered, and I will hold you accountable for their blood.
26003021 But if you do warn the righteous person not to sin and they do not sin, they will surely live because they took warning, and you will have saved yourself.”
26003022 The hand of the Lord was on me there, and he said to me, “Get up and go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you.”
26003023 So I got up and went out to the plain. And the glory of the Lord was standing there, like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown.
26003024 Then the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet. He spoke to me and said: “Go, shut yourself inside your house.
26003025 And you, son of man, they will tie with ropes; you will be bound so that you cannot go out among the people.
26003026 I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious people.
26003027 But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you shall say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says.’ Whoever will listen let them listen, and whoever will refuse let them refuse; for they are a rebellious people.
26004001 “Now, son of man, take a block of clay, put it in front of you and draw the city of Jerusalem on it.
26004002 Then lay siege to it: Erect siege works against it, build a ramp up to it, set up camps against it and put battering rams around it.
26004003 Then take an iron pan, place it as an iron wall between you and the city and turn your face toward it. It will be under siege, and you shall besiege it. This will be a sign to the people of Israel.
26004004 “Then lie on your left side and put the sin of the people of Israel upon yourself. You are to bear their sin for the number of days you lie on your side.
26004005 I have assigned you the same number of days as the years of their sin. So for 390 days you will bear the sin of the people of Israel.
26004006 “After you have finished this, lie down again, this time on your right side, and bear the sin of the people of Judah. I have assigned you 40 days, a day for each year.
26004007 Turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem and with bared arm prophesy against her.
26004008 I will tie you up with ropes so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have finished the days of your siege.
26004009 “Take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and spelt; put them in a storage jar and use them to make bread for yourself. You are to eat it during the 390 days you lie on your side.
26004010 Weigh out twenty shekels of food to eat each day and eat it at set times.
26004011 Also measure out a sixth of a hin of water and drink it at set times.
26004012 Eat the food as you would a loaf of barley bread; bake it in the sight of the people, using human excrement for fuel.”
26004013 The Lord said, “In this way the people of Israel will eat defiled food among the nations where I will drive them.”
26004014 Then I said, “Not so, Sovereign Lord! I have never defiled myself. From my youth until now I have never eaten anything found dead or torn by wild animals. No impure meat has ever entered my mouth.”
26004015 “Very well,” he said, “I will let you bake your bread over cow dung instead of human excrement.”
26004016 He then said to me: “Son of man, I am about to cut off the food supply in Jerusalem. The people will eat rationed food in anxiety and drink rationed water in despair,
26004017 for food and water will be scarce. They will be appalled at the sight of each other and will waste away because of their sin.
26005001 “Now, son of man, take a sharp sword and use it as a barber’s razor to shave your head and your beard. Then take a set of scales and divide up the hair.
26005002 When the days of your siege come to an end, burn a third of the hair inside the city. Take a third and strike it with the sword all around the city. And scatter a third to the wind. For I will pursue them with drawn sword.
26005003 But take a few hairs and tuck them away in the folds of your garment.
26005004 Again, take a few of these and throw them into the fire and burn them up. A fire will spread from there to all Israel.
26005005 “This is what the Sovereign Lord says: This is Jerusalem, which I have set in the center of the nations, with countries all around her.
26005006 Yet in her wickedness she has rebelled against my laws and decrees more than the nations and countries around her. She has rejected my laws and has not followed my decrees.
26005007 “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: You have been more unruly than the nations around you and have not followed my decrees or kept my laws. You have not even conformed to the standards of the nations around you.
26005008 “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I myself am against you, Jerusalem, and I will inflict punishment on you in the sight of the nations.
26005009 Because of all your detestable idols, I will do to you what I have never done before and will never do again.
26005010 Therefore in your midst parents will eat their children, and children will eat their parents. I will inflict punishment on you and will scatter all your survivors to the winds.
26005011 Therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your vile images and detestable practices, I myself will shave you; I will not look on you with pity or spare you.
26005012 A third of your people will die of the plague or perish by famine inside you; a third will fall by the sword outside your walls; and a third I will scatter to the winds and pursue with drawn sword.
26005013 “Then my anger will cease and my wrath against them will subside, and I will be avenged. And when I have spent my wrath on them, they will know that I the Lord have spoken in my zeal.
26005014 “I will make you a ruin and a reproach among the nations around you, in the sight of all who pass by.
26005015 You will be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and an object of horror to the nations around you when I inflict punishment on you in anger and in wrath and with stinging rebuke. I the Lord have spoken.
26005016 When I shoot at you with my deadly and destructive arrows of famine, I will shoot to destroy you. I will bring more and more famine upon you and cut off your supply of food.
26005017 I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will leave you childless. Plague and bloodshed will sweep through you, and I will bring the sword against you. I the Lord have spoken.”
26006001 The word of the Lord came to me:
26006002 “Son of man, set your face against the mountains of Israel; prophesy against them
26006003 and say: ‘You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign Lord. This is what the Sovereign Lord says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys: I am about to bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places.
26006004 Your altars will be demolished and your incense altars will be smashed; and I will slay your people in front of your idols.
26006005 I will lay the dead bodies of the Israelites in front of their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars.
26006006 Wherever you live, the towns will be laid waste and the high places demolished, so that your altars will be laid waste and devastated, your idols smashed and ruined, your incense altars broken down, and what you have made wiped out.
26006007 Your people will fall slain among you, and you will know that I am the Lord.
26006008 “ ‘But I will spare some, for some of you will escape the sword when you are scattered among the lands and nations.
26006009 Then in the nations where they have been carried captive, those who escape will remember me—how I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts, which have turned away from me, and by their eyes, which have lusted after their idols. They will loathe themselves for the evil they have done and for all their detestable practices.
26006010 And they will know that I am the Lord; I did not threaten in vain to bring this calamity on them.
26006011 “ ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Strike your hands together and stamp your feet and cry out “Alas!” because of all the wicked and detestable practices of the people of Israel, for they will fall by the sword, famine and plague.
26006012 One who is far away will die of the plague, and one who is near will fall by the sword, and anyone who survives and is spared will die of famine. So will I pour out my wrath on them.
26006013 And they will know that I am the Lord, when their people lie slain among their idols around their altars, on every high hill and on all the mountaintops, under every spreading tree and every leafy oak—places where they offered fragrant incense to all their idols.
26006014 And I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land a desolate waste from the desert to Diblah —wherever they live. Then they will know that I am the Lord.’ ”
26007001 The word of the Lord came to me:
26007002 “Son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord says to the land of Israel: “ ‘The end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land!
26007003 The end is now upon you, and I will unleash my anger against you. I will judge you according to your conduct and repay you for all your detestable practices.
26007004 I will not look on you with pity; I will not spare you. I will surely repay you for your conduct and for the detestable practices among you. “ ‘Then you will know that I am the Lord.’
26007005 “This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “ ‘Disaster! Unheard-of disaster! See, it comes!
26007006 The end has come! The end has come! It has roused itself against you. See, it comes!
26007007 Doom has come upon you, upon you who dwell in the land. The time has come! The day is near! There is panic, not joy, on the mountains.
26007008 I am about to pour out my wrath on you and spend my anger against you. I will judge you according to your conduct and repay you for all your detestable practices.
26007009 I will not look on you with pity; I will not spare you. I will repay you for your conduct and for the detestable practices among you. “ ‘Then you will know that it is I the Lord who strikes you.
26007010 “ ‘See, the day! See, it comes! Doom has burst forth, the rod has budded, arrogance has blossomed!
26007011 Violence has arisen, a rod to punish the wicked. None of the people will be left, none of that crowd— none of their wealth, nothing of value.
26007012 The time has come! The day has arrived! Let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller grieve, for my wrath is on the whole crowd.
26007013 The seller will not recover the property that was sold— as long as both buyer and seller live. For the vision concerning the whole crowd will not be reversed. Because of their sins, not one of them will preserve their life.
26007014 “ ‘They have blown the trumpet, they have made all things ready, but no one will go into battle, for my wrath is on the whole crowd.
26007015 Outside is the sword; inside are plague and famine. Those in the country will die by the sword; those in the city will be devoured by famine and plague.
26007016 The fugitives who escape will flee to the mountains. Like doves of the valleys, they will all moan, each for their own sins.
26007017 Every hand will go limp; every leg will be wet with urine.
26007018 They will put on sackcloth and be clothed with terror. Every face will be covered with shame, and every head will be shaved.
26007019 “ ‘They will throw their silver into the streets, and their gold will be treated as a thing unclean. Their silver and gold will not be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord’s wrath. It will not satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs, for it has caused them to stumble into sin.
26007020 They took pride in their beautiful jewelry and used it to make their detestable idols. They made it into vile images; therefore I will make it a thing unclean for them.
26007021 I will give their wealth as plunder to foreigners and as loot to the wicked of the earth, who will defile it.
26007022 I will turn my face away from the people, and robbers will desecrate the place I treasure. They will enter it and will defile it.
26007023 “ ‘Prepare chains! For the land is full of bloodshed, and the city is full of violence.
26007024 I will bring the most wicked of nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the mighty, and their sanctuaries will be desecrated.
26007025 When terror comes, they will seek peace in vain.
26007026 Calamity upon calamity will come, and rumor upon rumor. They will go searching for a vision from the prophet, priestly instruction in the law will cease, the counsel of the elders will come to an end.
26007027 The king will mourn, the prince will be clothed with despair, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. I will deal with them according to their conduct, and by their own standards I will judge them. “ ‘Then they will know that I am the Lord.’ ”
26008001 In the sixth year, in the sixth month on the fifth day, while I was sitting in my house and the elders of Judah were sitting before me, the hand of the Sovereign Lord came on me there.
26008002 I looked, and I saw a figure like that of a man. From what appeared to be his waist down he was like fire, and from there up his appearance was as bright as glowing metal.
26008003 He stretched out what looked like a hand and took me by the hair of my head. The Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and in visions of God he took me to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court, where the idol that provokes to jealousy stood.
26008004 And there before me was the glory of the God of Israel, as in the vision I had seen in the plain.
26008005 Then he said to me, “Son of man, look toward the north.” So I looked, and in the entrance north of the gate of the altar I saw this idol of jealousy.
26008006 And he said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing—the utterly detestable things the Israelites are doing here, things that will drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see things that are even more detestable.”
26008007 Then he brought me to the entrance to the court. I looked, and I saw a hole in the wall.
26008008 He said to me, “Son of man, now dig into the wall.” So I dug into the wall and saw a doorway there.
26008009 And he said to me, “Go in and see the wicked and detestable things they are doing here.”
26008010 So I went in and looked, and I saw portrayed all over the walls all kinds of crawling things and unclean animals and all the idols of Israel.
26008011 In front of them stood seventy elders of Israel, and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan was standing among them. Each had a censer in his hand, and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising.
26008012 He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of Israel are doing in the darkness, each at the shrine of his own idol? They say, ‘The Lord does not see us; the Lord has forsaken the land.’ ”
26008013 Again, he said, “You will see them doing things that are even more detestable.”
26008014 Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the Lord, and I saw women sitting there, mourning the god Tammuz.
26008015 He said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? You will see things that are even more detestable than this.”
26008016 He then brought me into the inner court of the house of the Lord, and there at the entrance to the temple, between the portico and the altar, were about twenty-five men. With their backs toward the temple of the Lord and their faces toward the east, they were bowing down to the sun in the east.
26008017 He said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a trivial matter for the people of Judah to do the detestable things they are doing here? Must they also fill the land with violence and continually arouse my anger? Look at them putting the branch to their nose!
26008018 Therefore I will deal with them in anger; I will not look on them with pity or spare them. Although they shout in my ears, I will not listen to them.”
26009001 Then I heard him call out in a loud voice, “Bring near those who are appointed to execute judgment on the city, each with a weapon in his hand.”
26009002 And I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with a deadly weapon in his hand. With them was a man clothed in linen who had a writing kit at his side. They came in and stood beside the bronze altar.
26009003 Now the glory of the God of Israel went up from above the cherubim, where it had been, and moved to the threshold of the temple. Then the Lord called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side
26009004 and said to him, “Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it.”
26009005 As I listened, he said to the others, “Follow him through the city and kill, without showing pity or compassion.
26009006 Slaughter the old men, the young men and women, the mothers and children, but do not touch anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.” So they began with the old men who were in front of the temple.
26009007 Then he said to them, “Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go!” So they went out and began killing throughout the city.
26009008 While they were killing and I was left alone, I fell facedown, crying out, “Alas, Sovereign Lord! Are you going to destroy the entire remnant of Israel in this outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?”
26009009 He answered me, “The sin of the people of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great; the land is full of bloodshed and the city is full of injustice. They say, ‘The Lord has forsaken the land; the Lord does not see.’
26009010 So I will not look on them with pity or spare them, but I will bring down on their own heads what they have done.”
26009011 Then the man in linen with the writing kit at his side brought back word, saying, “I have done as you commanded.”
26010001 I looked, and I saw the likeness of a throne of lapis lazuli above the vault that was over the heads of the cherubim.
26010002 The Lord said to the man clothed in linen, “Go in among the wheels beneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city.” And as I watched, he went in.
26010003 Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court.
26010004 Then the glory of the Lord rose from above the cherubim and moved to the threshold of the temple. The cloud filled the temple, and the court was full of the radiance of the glory of the Lord.
26010005 The sound of the wings of the cherubim could be heard as far away as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.
26010006 When the Lord commanded the man in linen, “Take fire from among the wheels, from among the cherubim,” the man went in and stood beside a wheel.
26010007 Then one of the cherubim reached out his hand to the fire that was among them. He took up some of it and put it into the hands of the man in linen, who took it and went out.
26010008 (Under the wings of the cherubim could be seen what looked like human hands.)
26010009 I looked, and I saw beside the cherubim four wheels, one beside each of the cherubim; the wheels sparkled like topaz.
26010010 As for their appearance, the four of them looked alike; each was like a wheel intersecting a wheel.
26010011 As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the cherubim faced; the wheels did not turn about as the cherubim went. The cherubim went in whatever direction the head faced, without turning as they went.
26010012 Their entire bodies, including their backs, their hands and their wings, were completely full of eyes, as were their four wheels.
26010013 I heard the wheels being called “the whirling wheels.”
26010014 Each of the cherubim had four faces: One face was that of a cherub, the second the face of a human being, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
26010015 Then the cherubim rose upward. These were the living creatures I had seen by the Kebar River.
26010016 When the cherubim moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the cherubim spread their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels did not leave their side.
26010017 When the cherubim stood still, they also stood still; and when the cherubim rose, they rose with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in them.
26010018 Then the glory of the Lord departed from over the threshold of the temple and stopped above the cherubim.
26010019 While I watched, the cherubim spread their wings and rose from the ground, and as they went, the wheels went with them. They stopped at the entrance of the east gate of the Lord’s house, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.
26010020 These were the living creatures I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the Kebar River, and I realized that they were cherubim.
26010021 Each had four faces and four wings, and under their wings was what looked like human hands.
26010022 Their faces had the same appearance as those I had seen by the Kebar River. Each one went straight ahead.
26011001 Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the gate of the house of the Lord that faces east. There at the entrance of the gate were twenty-five men, and I saw among them Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people.
26011002 The Lord said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who are plotting evil and giving wicked advice in this city.
26011003 They say, ‘Haven’t our houses been recently rebuilt? This city is a pot, and we are the meat in it.’
26011004 Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, son of man.”
26011005 Then the Spirit of the Lord came on me, and he told me to say: “This is what the Lord says: That is what you are saying, you leaders in Israel, but I know what is going through your mind.
26011006 You have killed many people in this city and filled its streets with the dead.
26011007 “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: The bodies you have thrown there are the meat and this city is the pot, but I will drive you out of it.
26011008 You fear the sword, and the sword is what I will bring against you, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26011009 I will drive you out of the city and deliver you into the hands of foreigners and inflict punishment on you.
26011010 You will fall by the sword, and I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26011011 This city will not be a pot for you, nor will you be the meat in it; I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel.
26011012 And you will know that I am the Lord, for you have not followed my decrees or kept my laws but have conformed to the standards of the nations around you.”
26011013 Now as I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown and cried out in a loud voice, “Alas, Sovereign Lord! Will you completely destroy the remnant of Israel?”
26011014 The word of the Lord came to me:
26011015 “Son of man, the people of Jerusalem have said of your fellow exiles and all the other Israelites, ‘They are far away from the Lord; this land was given to us as our possession.’
26011016 “Therefore say: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Although I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.’
26011017 “Therefore say: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will gather you from the nations and bring you back from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you back the land of Israel again.’
26011018 “They will return to it and remove all its vile images and detestable idols.
26011019 I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them; I will remove from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh.
26011020 Then they will follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. They will be my people, and I will be their God.
26011021 But as for those whose hearts are devoted to their vile images and detestable idols, I will bring down on their own heads what they have done, declares the Sovereign Lord.”
26011022 Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, spread their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.
26011023 The glory of the Lord went up from within the city and stopped above the mountain east of it.
26011024 The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the exiles in Babylonia in the vision given by the Spirit of God. Then the vision I had seen went up from me,
26011025 and I told the exiles everything the Lord had shown me.
26012001 The word of the Lord came to me:
26012002 “Son of man, you are living among a rebellious people. They have eyes to see but do not see and ears to hear but do not hear, for they are a rebellious people.
26012003 “Therefore, son of man, pack your belongings for exile and in the daytime, as they watch, set out and go from where you are to another place. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious people.
26012004 During the daytime, while they watch, bring out your belongings packed for exile. Then in the evening, while they are watching, go out like those who go into exile.
26012005 While they watch, dig through the wall and take your belongings out through it.
26012006 Put them on your shoulder as they are watching and carry them out at dusk. Cover your face so that you cannot see the land, for I have made you a sign to the Israelites.”
26012007 So I did as I was commanded. During the day I brought out my things packed for exile. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands. I took my belongings out at dusk, carrying them on my shoulders while they watched.
26012008 In the morning the word of the Lord came to me:
26012009 “Son of man, did not the Israelites, that rebellious people, ask you, ‘What are you doing?’
26012010 “Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: This prophecy concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the Israelites who are there.’
26012011 Say to them, ‘I am a sign to you.’ “As I have done, so it will be done to them. They will go into exile as captives.
26012012 “The prince among them will put his things on his shoulder at dusk and leave, and a hole will be dug in the wall for him to go through. He will cover his face so that he cannot see the land.
26012013 I will spread my net for him, and he will be caught in my snare; I will bring him to Babylonia, the land of the Chaldeans, but he will not see it, and there he will die.
26012014 I will scatter to the winds all those around him—his staff and all his troops—and I will pursue them with drawn sword.
26012015 “They will know that I am the Lord, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries.
26012016 But I will spare a few of them from the sword, famine and plague, so that in the nations where they go they may acknowledge all their detestable practices. Then they will know that I am the Lord.”
26012017 The word of the Lord came to me:
26012018 “Son of man, tremble as you eat your food, and shudder in fear as you drink your water.
26012019 Say to the people of the land: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says about those living in Jerusalem and in the land of Israel: They will eat their food in anxiety and drink their water in despair, for their land will be stripped of everything in it because of the violence of all who live there.
26012020 The inhabited towns will be laid waste and the land will be desolate. Then you will know that I am the Lord.’ ”
26012021 The word of the Lord came to me:
26012022 “Son of man, what is this proverb you have in the land of Israel: ‘The days go by and every vision comes to nothing’?
26012023 Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am going to put an end to this proverb, and they will no longer quote it in Israel.’ Say to them, ‘The days are near when every vision will be fulfilled.
26012024 For there will be no more false visions or flattering divinations among the people of Israel.
26012025 But I the Lord will speak what I will, and it shall be fulfilled without delay. For in your days, you rebellious people, I will fulfill whatever I say, declares the Sovereign Lord.’ ”
26012026 The word of the Lord came to me:
26012027 “Son of man, the Israelites are saying, ‘The vision he sees is for many years from now, and he prophesies about the distant future.’
26012028 “Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: None of my words will be delayed any longer; whatever I say will be fulfilled, declares the Sovereign Lord.’ ”
26013001 The word of the Lord came to me:
26013002 “Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are now prophesying. Say to those who prophesy out of their own imagination: ‘Hear the word of the Lord!
26013003 This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing!
26013004 Your prophets, Israel, are like jackals among ruins.
26013005 You have not gone up to the breaches in the wall to repair it for the people of Israel so that it will stand firm in the battle on the day of the Lord.
26013006 Their visions are false and their divinations a lie. Even though the Lord has not sent them, they say, “The Lord declares,” and expect him to fulfill their words.
26013007 Have you not seen false visions and uttered lying divinations when you say, “The Lord declares,” though I have not spoken?
26013008 “ ‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because of your false words and lying visions, I am against you, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26013009 My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations. They will not belong to the council of my people or be listed in the records of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign Lord.
26013010 “ ‘Because they lead my people astray, saying, “Peace,” when there is no peace, and because, when a flimsy wall is built, they cover it with whitewash,
26013011 therefore tell those who cover it with whitewash that it is going to fall. Rain will come in torrents, and I will send hailstones hurtling down, and violent winds will burst forth.
26013012 When the wall collapses, will people not ask you, “Where is the whitewash you covered it with?”
26013013 “ ‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: In my wrath I will unleash a violent wind, and in my anger hailstones and torrents of rain will fall with destructive fury.
26013014 I will tear down the wall you have covered with whitewash and will level it to the ground so that its foundation will be laid bare. When it falls, you will be destroyed in it; and you will know that I am the Lord.
26013015 So I will pour out my wrath against the wall and against those who covered it with whitewash. I will say to you, “The wall is gone and so are those who whitewashed it,
26013016 those prophets of Israel who prophesied to Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for her when there was no peace, declares the Sovereign Lord.” ’
26013017 “Now, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who prophesy out of their own imagination. Prophesy against them
26013018 and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Woe to the women who sew magic charms on all their wrists and make veils of various lengths for their heads in order to ensnare people. Will you ensnare the lives of my people but preserve your own?
26013019 You have profaned me among my people for a few handfuls of barley and scraps of bread. By lying to my people, who listen to lies, you have killed those who should not have died and have spared those who should not live.
26013020 “ ‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against your magic charms with which you ensnare people like birds and I will tear them from your arms; I will set free the people that you ensnare like birds.
26013021 I will tear off your veils and save my people from your hands, and they will no longer fall prey to your power. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26013022 Because you disheartened the righteous with your lies, when I had brought them no grief, and because you encouraged the wicked not to turn from their evil ways and so save their lives,
26013023 therefore you will no longer see false visions or practice divination. I will save my people from your hands. And then you will know that I am the Lord.’ ”
26014001 Some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat down in front of me.
26014002 Then the word of the Lord came to me:
26014003 “Son of man, these men have set up idols in their hearts and put wicked stumbling blocks before their faces. Should I let them inquire of me at all?
26014004 Therefore speak to them and tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: When any of the Israelites set up idols in their hearts and put a wicked stumbling block before their faces and then go to a prophet, I the Lord will answer them myself in keeping with their great idolatry.
26014005 I will do this to recapture the hearts of the people of Israel, who have all deserted me for their idols.’
26014006 “Therefore say to the people of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Repent! Turn from your idols and renounce all your detestable practices!
26014007 “ ‘When any of the Israelites or any foreigner residing in Israel separate themselves from me and set up idols in their hearts and put a wicked stumbling block before their faces and then go to a prophet to inquire of me, I the Lord will answer them myself.
26014008 I will set my face against them and make them an example and a byword. I will remove them from my people. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26014009 “ ‘And if the prophet is enticed to utter a prophecy, I the Lord have enticed that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and destroy him from among my people Israel.
26014010 They will bear their guilt—the prophet will be as guilty as the one who consults him.
26014011 Then the people of Israel will no longer stray from me, nor will they defile themselves anymore with all their sins. They will be my people, and I will be their God, declares the Sovereign Lord.’ ”
26014012 The word of the Lord came to me:
26014013 “Son of man, if a country sins against me by being unfaithful and I stretch out my hand against it to cut off its food supply and send famine upon it and kill its people and their animals,
26014014 even if these three men—Noah, Daniel and Job—were in it, they could save only themselves by their righteousness, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26014015 “Or if I send wild beasts through that country and they leave it childless and it becomes desolate so that no one can pass through it because of the beasts,
26014016 as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, even if these three men were in it, they could not save their own sons or daughters. They alone would be saved, but the land would be desolate.
26014017 “Or if I bring a sword against that country and say, ‘Let the sword pass throughout the land,’ and I kill its people and their animals,
26014018 as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, even if these three men were in it, they could not save their own sons or daughters. They alone would be saved.
26014019 “Or if I send a plague into that land and pour out my wrath on it through bloodshed, killing its people and their animals,
26014020 as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, even if Noah, Daniel and Job were in it, they could save neither son nor daughter. They would save only themselves by their righteousness.
26014021 “For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: How much worse will it be when I send against Jerusalem my four dreadful judgments—sword and famine and wild beasts and plague—to kill its men and their animals!
26014022 Yet there will be some survivors—sons and daughters who will be brought out of it. They will come to you, and when you see their conduct and their actions, you will be consoled regarding the disaster I have brought on Jerusalem—every disaster I have brought on it.
26014023 You will be consoled when you see their conduct and their actions, for you will know that I have done nothing in it without cause, declares the Sovereign Lord.”
26015001 The word of the Lord came to me:
26015002 “Son of man, how is the wood of a vine different from that of a branch from any of the trees in the forest?
26015003 Is wood ever taken from it to make anything useful? Do they make pegs from it to hang things on?
26015004 And after it is thrown on the fire as fuel and the fire burns both ends and chars the middle, is it then useful for anything?
26015005 If it was not useful for anything when it was whole, how much less can it be made into something useful when the fire has burned it and it is charred?
26015006 “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: As I have given the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest as fuel for the fire, so will I treat the people living in Jerusalem.
26015007 I will set my face against them. Although they have come out of the fire, the fire will yet consume them. And when I set my face against them, you will know that I am the Lord.
26015008 I will make the land desolate because they have been unfaithful, declares the Sovereign Lord.”
26016001 The word of the Lord came to me:
26016002 “Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her detestable practices
26016003 and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says to Jerusalem: Your ancestry and birth were in the land of the Canaanites; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.
26016004 On the day you were born your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water to make you clean, nor were you rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloths.
26016005 No one looked on you with pity or had compassion enough to do any of these things for you. Rather, you were thrown out into the open field, for on the day you were born you were despised.
26016006 “ ‘Then I passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood, and as you lay there in your blood I said to you, “Live!”
26016007 I made you grow like a plant of the field. You grew and developed and entered puberty. Your breasts had formed and your hair had grown, yet you were stark naked.
26016008 “ ‘Later I passed by, and when I looked at you and saw that you were old enough for love, I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your naked body. I gave you my solemn oath and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Sovereign Lord, and you became mine.
26016009 “ ‘I bathed you with water and washed the blood from you and put ointments on you.
26016010 I clothed you with an embroidered dress and put sandals of fine leather on you. I dressed you in fine linen and covered you with costly garments.
26016011 I adorned you with jewelry: I put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck,
26016012 and I put a ring on your nose, earrings on your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.
26016013 So you were adorned with gold and silver; your clothes were of fine linen and costly fabric and embroidered cloth. Your food was honey, olive oil and the finest flour. You became very beautiful and rose to be a queen.
26016014 And your fame spread among the nations on account of your beauty, because the splendor I had given you made your beauty perfect, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26016015 “ ‘But you trusted in your beauty and used your fame to become a prostitute. You lavished your favors on anyone who passed by and your beauty became his.
26016016 You took some of your garments to make gaudy high places, where you carried on your prostitution. You went to him, and he possessed your beauty.
26016017 You also took the fine jewelry I gave you, the jewelry made of my gold and silver, and you made for yourself male idols and engaged in prostitution with them.
26016018 And you took your embroidered clothes to put on them, and you offered my oil and incense before them.
26016019 Also the food I provided for you—the flour, olive oil and honey I gave you to eat—you offered as fragrant incense before them. That is what happened, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26016020 “ ‘And you took your sons and daughters whom you bore to me and sacrificed them as food to the idols. Was your prostitution not enough?
26016021 You slaughtered my children and sacrificed them to the idols.
26016022 In all your detestable practices and your prostitution you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, kicking about in your blood.
26016023 “ ‘Woe! Woe to you, declares the Sovereign Lord. In addition to all your other wickedness,
26016024 you built a mound for yourself and made a lofty shrine in every public square.
26016025 At every street corner you built your lofty shrines and degraded your beauty, spreading your legs with increasing promiscuity to anyone who passed by.
26016026 You engaged in prostitution with the Egyptians, your neighbors with large genitals, and aroused my anger with your increasing promiscuity.
26016027 So I stretched out my hand against you and reduced your territory; I gave you over to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were shocked by your lewd conduct.
26016028 You engaged in prostitution with the Assyrians too, because you were insatiable; and even after that, you still were not satisfied.
26016029 Then you increased your promiscuity to include Babylonia, a land of merchants, but even with this you were not satisfied.
26016030 “ ‘I am filled with fury against you, declares the Sovereign Lord, when you do all these things, acting like a brazen prostitute!
26016031 When you built your mounds at every street corner and made your lofty shrines in every public square, you were unlike a prostitute, because you scorned payment.
26016032 “ ‘You adulterous wife! You prefer strangers to your own husband!
26016033 All prostitutes receive gifts, but you give gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from everywhere for your illicit favors.
26016034 So in your prostitution you are the opposite of others; no one runs after you for your favors. You are the very opposite, for you give payment and none is given to you.
26016035 “ ‘Therefore, you prostitute, hear the word of the Lord!
26016036 This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because you poured out your lust and exposed your naked body in your promiscuity with your lovers, and because of all your detestable idols, and because you gave them your children’s blood,
26016037 therefore I am going to gather all your lovers, with whom you found pleasure, those you loved as well as those you hated. I will gather them against you from all around and will strip you in front of them, and they will see you stark naked.
26016038 I will sentence you to the punishment of women who commit adultery and who shed blood; I will bring on you the blood vengeance of my wrath and jealous anger.
26016039 Then I will deliver you into the hands of your lovers, and they will tear down your mounds and destroy your lofty shrines. They will strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry and leave you stark naked.
26016040 They will bring a mob against you, who will stone you and hack you to pieces with their swords.
26016041 They will burn down your houses and inflict punishment on you in the sight of many women. I will put a stop to your prostitution, and you will no longer pay your lovers.
26016042 Then my wrath against you will subside and my jealous anger will turn away from you; I will be calm and no longer angry.
26016043 “ ‘Because you did not remember the days of your youth but enraged me with all these things, I will surely bring down on your head what you have done, declares the Sovereign Lord. Did you not add lewdness to all your other detestable practices?
26016044 “ ‘Everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb about you: “Like mother, like daughter.”
26016045 You are a true daughter of your mother, who despised her husband and her children; and you are a true sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.
26016046 Your older sister was Samaria, who lived to the north of you with her daughters; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you with her daughters, was Sodom.
26016047 You not only followed their ways and copied their detestable practices, but in all your ways you soon became more depraved than they.
26016048 As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you and your daughters have done.
26016049 “ ‘Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.
26016050 They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen.
26016051 Samaria did not commit half the sins you did. You have done more detestable things than they, and have made your sisters seem righteous by all these things you have done.
26016052 Bear your disgrace, for you have furnished some justification for your sisters. Because your sins were more vile than theirs, they appear more righteous than you. So then, be ashamed and bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous.
26016053 “ ‘However, I will restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and of Samaria and her daughters, and your fortunes along with them,
26016054 so that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you have done in giving them comfort.
26016055 And your sisters, Sodom with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters, will return to what they were before; and you and your daughters will return to what you were before.
26016056 You would not even mention your sister Sodom in the day of your pride,
26016057 before your wickedness was uncovered. Even so, you are now scorned by the daughters of Edom and all her neighbors and the daughters of the Philistines—all those around you who despise you.
26016058 You will bear the consequences of your lewdness and your detestable practices, declares the Lord.
26016059 “ ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will deal with you as you deserve, because you have despised my oath by breaking the covenant.
26016060 Yet I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you.
26016061 Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both those who are older than you and those who are younger. I will give them to you as daughters, but not on the basis of my covenant with you.
26016062 So I will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am the Lord.
26016063 Then, when I make atonement for you for all you have done, you will remember and be ashamed and never again open your mouth because of your humiliation, declares the Sovereign Lord.’ ”
26017001 The word of the Lord came to me:
26017002 “Son of man, set forth an allegory and tell it to the Israelites as a parable.
26017003 Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: A great eagle with powerful wings, long feathers and full plumage of varied colors came to Lebanon. Taking hold of the top of a cedar,
26017004 he broke off its topmost shoot and carried it away to a land of merchants, where he planted it in a city of traders.
26017005 “ ‘He took one of the seedlings of the land and put it in fertile soil. He planted it like a willow by abundant water,
26017006 and it sprouted and became a low, spreading vine. Its branches turned toward him, but its roots remained under it. So it became a vine and produced branches and put out leafy boughs.
26017007 “ ‘But there was another great eagle with powerful wings and full plumage. The vine now sent out its roots toward him from the plot where it was planted and stretched out its branches to him for water.
26017008 It had been planted in good soil by abundant water so that it would produce branches, bear fruit and become a splendid vine.’
26017009 “Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Will it thrive? Will it not be uprooted and stripped of its fruit so that it withers? All its new growth will wither. It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it up by the roots.
26017010 It has been planted, but will it thrive? Will it not wither completely when the east wind strikes it—wither away in the plot where it grew?’ ”
26017011 Then the word of the Lord came to me:
26017012 “Say to this rebellious people, ‘Do you not know what these things mean?’ Say to them: ‘The king of Babylon went to Jerusalem and carried off her king and her nobles, bringing them back with him to Babylon.
26017013 Then he took a member of the royal family and made a treaty with him, putting him under oath. He also carried away the leading men of the land,
26017014 so that the kingdom would be brought low, unable to rise again, surviving only by keeping his treaty.
26017015 But the king rebelled against him by sending his envoys to Egypt to get horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Will he who does such things escape? Will he break the treaty and yet escape?
26017016 “ ‘As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, he shall die in Babylon, in the land of the king who put him on the throne, whose oath he despised and whose treaty he broke.
26017017 Pharaoh with his mighty army and great horde will be of no help to him in war, when ramps are built and siege works erected to destroy many lives.
26017018 He despised the oath by breaking the covenant. Because he had given his hand in pledge and yet did all these things, he shall not escape.
26017019 “ ‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: As surely as I live, I will repay him for despising my oath and breaking my covenant.
26017020 I will spread my net for him, and he will be caught in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon and execute judgment on him there because he was unfaithful to me.
26017021 All his choice troops will fall by the sword, and the survivors will be scattered to the winds. Then you will know that I the Lord have spoken.
26017022 “ ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I myself will take a shoot from the very top of a cedar and plant it; I will break off a tender sprig from its topmost shoots and plant it on a high and lofty mountain.
26017023 On the mountain heights of Israel I will plant it; it will produce branches and bear fruit and become a splendid cedar. Birds of every kind will nest in it; they will find shelter in the shade of its branches.
26017024 All the trees of the forest will know that I the Lord bring down the tall tree and make the low tree grow tall. I dry up the green tree and make the dry tree flourish. “ ‘I the Lord have spoken, and I will do it.’ ”
26018001 The word of the Lord came to me:
26018002 “What do you people mean by quoting this proverb about the land of Israel: “ ‘The parents eat sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge’?
26018003 “As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, you will no longer quote this proverb in Israel.
26018004 For everyone belongs to me, the parent as well as the child—both alike belong to me. The one who sins is the one who will die.
26018005 “Suppose there is a righteous man who does what is just and right.
26018006 He does not eat at the mountain shrines or look to the idols of Israel. He does not defile his neighbor’s wife or have sexual relations with a woman during her period.
26018007 He does not oppress anyone, but returns what he took in pledge for a loan. He does not commit robbery but gives his food to the hungry and provides clothing for the naked.
26018008 He does not lend to them at interest or take a profit from them. He withholds his hand from doing wrong and judges fairly between two parties.
26018009 He follows my decrees and faithfully keeps my laws. That man is righteous; he will surely live, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26018010 “Suppose he has a violent son, who sheds blood or does any of these other things
26018011 (though the father has done none of them): “He eats at the mountain shrines. He defiles his neighbor’s wife.
26018012 He oppresses the poor and needy. He commits robbery. He does not return what he took in pledge. He looks to the idols. He does detestable things.
26018013 He lends at interest and takes a profit. Will such a man live? He will not! Because he has done all these detestable things, he is to be put to death; his blood will be on his own head.
26018014 “But suppose this son has a son who sees all the sins his father commits, and though he sees them, he does not do such things:
26018015 “He does not eat at the mountain shrines or look to the idols of Israel. He does not defile his neighbor’s wife.
26018016 He does not oppress anyone or require a pledge for a loan. He does not commit robbery but gives his food to the hungry and provides clothing for the naked.
26018017 He withholds his hand from mistreating the poor and takes no interest or profit from them. He keeps my laws and follows my decrees. He will not die for his father’s sin; he will surely live.
26018018 But his father will die for his own sin, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother and did what was wrong among his people.
26018019 “Yet you ask, ‘Why does the son not share the guilt of his father?’ Since the son has done what is just and right and has been careful to keep all my decrees, he will surely live.
26018020 The one who sins is the one who will die. The child will not share the guilt of the parent, nor will the parent share the guilt of the child. The righteousness of the righteous will be credited to them, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against them.
26018021 “But if a wicked person turns away from all the sins they have committed and keeps all my decrees and does what is just and right, that person will surely live; they will not die.
26018022 None of the offenses they have committed will be remembered against them. Because of the righteous things they have done, they will live.
26018023 Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign Lord. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live?
26018024 “But if a righteous person turns from their righteousness and commits sin and does the same detestable things the wicked person does, will they live? None of the righteous things that person has done will be remembered. Because of the unfaithfulness they are guilty of and because of the sins they have committed, they will die.
26018025 “Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ Hear, you Israelites: Is my way unjust? Is it not your ways that are unjust?
26018026 If a righteous person turns from their righteousness and commits sin, they will die for it; because of the sin they have committed they will die.
26018027 But if a wicked person turns away from the wickedness they have committed and does what is just and right, they will save their life.
26018028 Because they consider all the offenses they have committed and turn away from them, that person will surely live; they will not die.
26018029 Yet the Israelites say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ Are my ways unjust, people of Israel? Is it not your ways that are unjust?
26018030 “Therefore, you Israelites, I will judge each of you according to your own ways, declares the Sovereign Lord. Repent! Turn away from all your offenses; then sin will not be your downfall.
26018031 Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committed, and get a new heart and a new spirit. Why will you die, people of Israel?
26018032 For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord. Repent and live!
26019001 “Take up a lament concerning the princes of Israel
26019002 and say: “ ‘What a lioness was your mother among the lions! She lay down among them and reared her cubs.
26019003 She brought up one of her cubs, and he became a strong lion. He learned to tear the prey and he became a man-eater.
26019004 The nations heard about him, and he was trapped in their pit. They led him with hooks to the land of Egypt.
26019005 “ ‘When she saw her hope unfulfilled, her expectation gone, she took another of her cubs and made him a strong lion.
26019006 He prowled among the lions, for he was now a strong lion. He learned to tear the prey and he became a man-eater.
26019007 He broke down their strongholds and devastated their towns. The land and all who were in it were terrified by his roaring.
26019008 Then the nations came against him, those from regions round about. They spread their net for him, and he was trapped in their pit.
26019009 With hooks they pulled him into a cage and brought him to the king of Babylon. They put him in prison, so his roar was heard no longer on the mountains of Israel.
26019010 “ ‘Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard planted by the water; it was fruitful and full of branches because of abundant water.
26019011 Its branches were strong, fit for a ruler’s scepter. It towered high above the thick foliage, conspicuous for its height and for its many branches.
26019012 But it was uprooted in fury and thrown to the ground. The east wind made it shrivel, it was stripped of its fruit; its strong branches withered and fire consumed them.
26019013 Now it is planted in the desert, in a dry and thirsty land.
26019014 Fire spread from one of its main branches and consumed its fruit. No strong branch is left on it fit for a ruler’s scepter.’ “This is a lament and is to be used as a lament.”
26020001 In the seventh year, in the fifth month on the tenth day, some of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the Lord, and they sat down in front of me.
26020002 Then the word of the Lord came to me:
26020003 “Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Have you come to inquire of me? As surely as I live, I will not let you inquire of me, declares the Sovereign Lord.’
26020004 “Will you judge them? Will you judge them, son of man? Then confront them with the detestable practices of their ancestors
26020005 and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: On the day I chose Israel, I swore with uplifted hand to the descendants of Jacob and revealed myself to them in Egypt. With uplifted hand I said to them, “I am the Lord your God.”
26020006 On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of Egypt into a land I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful of all lands.
26020007 And I said to them, “Each of you, get rid of the vile images you have set your eyes on, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.”
26020008 “ ‘But they rebelled against me and would not listen to me; they did not get rid of the vile images they had set their eyes on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and spend my anger against them in Egypt.
26020009 But for the sake of my name, I brought them out of Egypt. I did it to keep my name from being profaned in the eyes of the nations among whom they lived and in whose sight I had revealed myself to the Israelites.
26020010 Therefore I led them out of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.
26020011 I gave them my decrees and made known to them my laws, by which the person who obeys them will live.
26020012 Also I gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between us, so they would know that I the Lord made them holy.
26020013 “ ‘Yet the people of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They did not follow my decrees but rejected my laws—by which the person who obeys them will live—and they utterly desecrated my Sabbaths. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and destroy them in the wilderness.
26020014 But for the sake of my name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.
26020015 Also with uplifted hand I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land I had given them—a land flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful of all lands—
26020016 because they rejected my laws and did not follow my decrees and desecrated my Sabbaths. For their hearts were devoted to their idols.
26020017 Yet I looked on them with pity and did not destroy them or put an end to them in the wilderness.
26020018 I said to their children in the wilderness, “Do not follow the statutes of your parents or keep their laws or defile yourselves with their idols.
26020019 I am the Lord your God; follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.
26020020 Keep my Sabbaths holy, that they may be a sign between us. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God.”
26020021 “ ‘But the children rebelled against me: They did not follow my decrees, they were not careful to keep my laws, of which I said, “The person who obeys them will live by them,” and they desecrated my Sabbaths. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and spend my anger against them in the wilderness.
26020022 But I withheld my hand, and for the sake of my name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.
26020023 Also with uplifted hand I swore to them in the wilderness that I would disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries,
26020024 because they had not obeyed my laws but had rejected my decrees and desecrated my Sabbaths, and their eyes lusted after their parents’ idols.
26020025 So I gave them other statutes that were not good and laws through which they could not live;
26020026 I defiled them through their gifts—the sacrifice of every firstborn—that I might fill them with horror so they would know that I am the Lord.’
26020027 “Therefore, son of man, speak to the people of Israel and say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: In this also your ancestors blasphemed me by being unfaithful to me:
26020028 When I brought them into the land I had sworn to give them and they saw any high hill or any leafy tree, there they offered their sacrifices, made offerings that aroused my anger, presented their fragrant incense and poured out their drink offerings.
26020029 Then I said to them: What is this high place you go to?’ ” (It is called Bamah to this day.)
26020030 “Therefore say to the Israelites: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Will you defile yourselves the way your ancestors did and lust after their vile images?
26020031 When you offer your gifts—the sacrifice of your children in the fire—you continue to defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. Am I to let you inquire of me, you Israelites? As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I will not let you inquire of me.
26020032 “ ‘You say, “We want to be like the nations, like the peoples of the world, who serve wood and stone.” But what you have in mind will never happen.
26020033 As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I will reign over you with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with outpoured wrath.
26020034 I will bring you from the nations and gather you from the countries where you have been scattered—with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with outpoured wrath.
26020035 I will bring you into the wilderness of the nations and there, face to face, I will execute judgment upon you.
26020036 As I judged your ancestors in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will judge you, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26020037 I will take note of you as you pass under my rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.
26020038 I will purge you of those who revolt and rebel against me. Although I will bring them out of the land where they are living, yet they will not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26020039 “ ‘As for you, people of Israel, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Go and serve your idols, every one of you! But afterward you will surely listen to me and no longer profane my holy name with your gifts and idols.
26020040 For on my holy mountain, the high mountain of Israel, declares the Sovereign Lord, there in the land all the people of Israel will serve me, and there I will accept them. There I will require your offerings and your choice gifts, along with all your holy sacrifices.
26020041 I will accept you as fragrant incense when I bring you out from the nations and gather you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will be proved holy through you in the sight of the nations.
26020042 Then you will know that I am the Lord, when I bring you into the land of Israel, the land I had sworn with uplifted hand to give to your ancestors.
26020043 There you will remember your conduct and all the actions by which you have defiled yourselves, and you will loathe yourselves for all the evil you have done.
26020044 You will know that I am the Lord, when I deal with you for my name’s sake and not according to your evil ways and your corrupt practices, you people of Israel, declares the Sovereign Lord.’ ”
26020045 The word of the Lord came to me:
26020046 “Son of man, set your face toward the south; preach against the south and prophesy against the forest of the southland.
26020047 Say to the southern forest: ‘Hear the word of the Lord. This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am about to set fire to you, and it will consume all your trees, both green and dry. The blazing flame will not be quenched, and every face from south to north will be scorched by it.
26020048 Everyone will see that I the Lord have kindled it; it will not be quenched.’ ”
26020049 Then I said, “Sovereign Lord, they are saying of me, ‘Isn’t he just telling parables?’ ”
26021001 The word of the Lord came to me:
26021002 “Son of man, set your face against Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuary. Prophesy against the land of Israel
26021003 and say to her: ‘This is what the Lord says: I am against you. I will draw my sword from its sheath and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked.
26021004 Because I am going to cut off the righteous and the wicked, my sword will be unsheathed against everyone from south to north.
26021005 Then all people will know that I the Lord have drawn my sword from its sheath; it will not return again.’
26021006 “Therefore groan, son of man! Groan before them with broken heart and bitter grief.
26021007 And when they ask you, ‘Why are you groaning?’ you shall say, ‘Because of the news that is coming. Every heart will melt with fear and every hand go limp; every spirit will become faint and every leg will be wet with urine.’ It is coming! It will surely take place, declares the Sovereign Lord.”
26021008 The word of the Lord came to me:
26021009 “Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Lord says: “ ‘A sword, a sword, sharpened and polished—
26021010 sharpened for the slaughter, polished to flash like lightning! “ ‘Shall we rejoice in the scepter of my royal son? The sword despises every such stick.
26021011 “ ‘The sword is appointed to be polished, to be grasped with the hand; it is sharpened and polished, made ready for the hand of the slayer.
26021012 Cry out and wail, son of man, for it is against my people; it is against all the princes of Israel. They are thrown to the sword along with my people. Therefore beat your breast.
26021013 “ ‘Testing will surely come. And what if even the scepter, which the sword despises, does not continue? declares the Sovereign Lord.’
26021014 “So then, son of man, prophesy and strike your hands together. Let the sword strike twice, even three times. It is a sword for slaughter— a sword for great slaughter, closing in on them from every side.
26021015 So that hearts may melt with fear and the fallen be many, I have stationed the sword for slaughter at all their gates. Look! It is forged to strike like lightning, it is grasped for slaughter.
26021016 Slash to the right, you sword, then to the left, wherever your blade is turned.
26021017 I too will strike my hands together, and my wrath will subside. I the Lord have spoken.”
26021018 The word of the Lord came to me:
26021019 “Son of man, mark out two roads for the sword of the king of Babylon to take, both starting from the same country. Make a signpost where the road branches off to the city.
26021020 Mark out one road for the sword to come against Rabbah of the Ammonites and another against Judah and fortified Jerusalem.
26021021 For the king of Babylon will stop at the fork in the road, at the junction of the two roads, to seek an omen: He will cast lots with arrows, he will consult his idols, he will examine the liver.
26021022 Into his right hand will come the lot for Jerusalem, where he is to set up battering rams, to give the command to slaughter, to sound the battle cry, to set battering rams against the gates, to build a ramp and to erect siege works.
26021023 It will seem like a false omen to those who have sworn allegiance to him, but he will remind them of their guilt and take them captive.
26021024 “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: ‘Because you people have brought to mind your guilt by your open rebellion, revealing your sins in all that you do—because you have done this, you will be taken captive.
26021025 “ ‘You profane and wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come, whose time of punishment has reached its climax,
26021026 this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Take off the turban, remove the crown. It will not be as it was: The lowly will be exalted and the exalted will be brought low.
26021027 A ruin! A ruin! I will make it a ruin! The crown will not be restored until he to whom it rightfully belongs shall come; to him I will give it.’
26021028 “And you, son of man, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says about the Ammonites and their insults: “ ‘A sword, a sword, drawn for the slaughter, polished to consume and to flash like lightning!
26021029 Despite false visions concerning you and lying divinations about you, it will be laid on the necks of the wicked who are to be slain, whose day has come, whose time of punishment has reached its climax.
26021030 “ ‘Let the sword return to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your ancestry, I will judge you.
26021031 I will pour out my wrath on you and breathe out my fiery anger against you; I will deliver you into the hands of brutal men, men skilled in destruction.
26021032 You will be fuel for the fire, your blood will be shed in your land, you will be remembered no more; for I the Lord have spoken.’ ”
26022001 The word of the Lord came to me:
26022002 “Son of man, will you judge her? Will you judge this city of bloodshed? Then confront her with all her detestable practices
26022003 and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: You city that brings on herself doom by shedding blood in her midst and defiles herself by making idols,
26022004 you have become guilty because of the blood you have shed and have become defiled by the idols you have made. You have brought your days to a close, and the end of your years has come. Therefore I will make you an object of scorn to the nations and a laughingstock to all the countries.
26022005 Those who are near and those who are far away will mock you, you infamous city, full of turmoil.
26022006 “ ‘See how each of the princes of Israel who are in you uses his power to shed blood.
26022007 In you they have treated father and mother with contempt; in you they have oppressed the foreigner and mistreated the fatherless and the widow.
26022008 You have despised my holy things and desecrated my Sabbaths.
26022009 In you are slanderers who are bent on shedding blood; in you are those who eat at the mountain shrines and commit lewd acts.
26022010 In you are those who dishonor their father’s bed; in you are those who violate women during their period, when they are ceremonially unclean.
26022011 In you one man commits a detestable offense with his neighbor’s wife, another shamefully defiles his daughter-in-law, and another violates his sister, his own father’s daughter.
26022012 In you are people who accept bribes to shed blood; you take interest and make a profit from the poor. You extort unjust gain from your neighbors. And you have forgotten me, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26022013 “ ‘I will surely strike my hands together at the unjust gain you have made and at the blood you have shed in your midst.
26022014 Will your courage endure or your hands be strong in the day I deal with you? I the Lord have spoken, and I will do it.
26022015 I will disperse you among the nations and scatter you through the countries; and I will put an end to your uncleanness.
26022016 When you have been defiled in the eyes of the nations, you will know that I am the Lord.’ ”
26022017 Then the word of the Lord came to me:
26022018 “Son of man, the people of Israel have become dross to me; all of them are the copper, tin, iron and lead left inside a furnace. They are but the dross of silver.
26022019 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: ‘Because you have all become dross, I will gather you into Jerusalem.
26022020 As silver, copper, iron, lead and tin are gathered into a furnace to be melted with a fiery blast, so will I gather you in my anger and my wrath and put you inside the city and melt you.
26022021 I will gather you and I will blow on you with my fiery wrath, and you will be melted inside her.
26022022 As silver is melted in a furnace, so you will be melted inside her, and you will know that I the Lord have poured out my wrath on you.’ ”
26022023 Again the word of the Lord came to me:
26022024 “Son of man, say to the land, ‘You are a land that has not been cleansed or rained on in the day of wrath.’
26022025 There is a conspiracy of her princes within her like a roaring lion tearing its prey; they devour people, take treasures and precious things and make many widows within her.
26022026 Her priests do violence to my law and profane my holy things; they do not distinguish between the holy and the common; they teach that there is no difference between the unclean and the clean; and they shut their eyes to the keeping of my Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them.
26022027 Her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey; they shed blood and kill people to make unjust gain.
26022028 Her prophets whitewash these deeds for them by false visions and lying divinations. They say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says’—when the Lord has not spoken.
26022029 The people of the land practice extortion and commit robbery; they oppress the poor and needy and mistreat the foreigner, denying them justice.
26022030 “I looked for someone among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not have to destroy it, but I found no one.
26022031 So I will pour out my wrath on them and consume them with my fiery anger, bringing down on their own heads all they have done, declares the Sovereign Lord.”
26023001 The word of the Lord came to me:
26023002 “Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother.
26023003 They became prostitutes in Egypt, engaging in prostitution from their youth. In that land their breasts were fondled and their virgin bosoms caressed.
26023004 The older was named Oholah, and her sister was Oholibah. They were mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.
26023005 “Oholah engaged in prostitution while she was still mine; and she lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians—warriors
26023006 clothed in blue, governors and commanders, all of them handsome young men, and mounted horsemen.
26023007 She gave herself as a prostitute to all the elite of the Assyrians and defiled herself with all the idols of everyone she lusted after.
26023008 She did not give up the prostitution she began in Egypt, when during her youth men slept with her, caressed her virgin bosom and poured out their lust on her.
26023009 “Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, the Assyrians, for whom she lusted.
26023010 They stripped her naked, took away her sons and daughters and killed her with the sword. She became a byword among women, and punishment was inflicted on her.
26023011 “Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet in her lust and prostitution she was more depraved than her sister.
26023012 She too lusted after the Assyrians—governors and commanders, warriors in full dress, mounted horsemen, all handsome young men.
26023013 I saw that she too defiled herself; both of them went the same way.
26023014 “But she carried her prostitution still further. She saw men portrayed on a wall, figures of Chaldeans portrayed in red,
26023015 with belts around their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like Babylonian chariot officers, natives of Chaldea.
26023016 As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
26023017 Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and in their lust they defiled her. After she had been defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust.
26023018 When she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her naked body, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister.
26023019 Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt.
26023020 There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses.
26023021 So you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled.
26023022 “Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will stir up your lovers against you, those you turned away from in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side—
26023023 the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, the men of Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, handsome young men, all of them governors and commanders, chariot officers and men of high rank, all mounted on horses.
26023024 They will come against you with weapons, chariots and wagons and with a throng of people; they will take up positions against you on every side with large and small shields and with helmets. I will turn you over to them for punishment, and they will punish you according to their standards.
26023025 I will direct my jealous anger against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will cut off your noses and your ears, and those of you who are left will fall by the sword. They will take away your sons and daughters, and those of you who are left will be consumed by fire.
26023026 They will also strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry.
26023027 So I will put a stop to the lewdness and prostitution you began in Egypt. You will not look on these things with longing or remember Egypt anymore.
26023028 “For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am about to deliver you into the hands of those you hate, to those you turned away from in disgust.
26023029 They will deal with you in hatred and take away everything you have worked for. They will leave you stark naked, and the shame of your prostitution will be exposed. Your lewdness and promiscuity
26023030 have brought this on you, because you lusted after the nations and defiled yourself with their idols.
26023031 You have gone the way of your sister; so I will put her cup into your hand.
26023032 “This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “You will drink your sister’s cup, a cup large and deep; it will bring scorn and derision, for it holds so much.
26023033 You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, the cup of ruin and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria.
26023034 You will drink it and drain it dry and chew on its pieces— and you will tear your breasts. I have spoken, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26023035 “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Since you have forgotten me and turned your back on me, you must bear the consequences of your lewdness and prostitution.”
26023036 The Lord said to me: “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then confront them with their detestable practices,
26023037 for they have committed adultery and blood is on their hands. They committed adultery with their idols; they even sacrificed their children, whom they bore to me, as food for them.
26023038 They have also done this to me: At that same time they defiled my sanctuary and desecrated my Sabbaths.
26023039 On the very day they sacrificed their children to their idols, they entered my sanctuary and desecrated it. That is what they did in my house.
26023040 “They even sent messengers for men who came from far away, and when they arrived you bathed yourself for them, applied eye makeup and put on your jewelry.
26023041 You sat on an elegant couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed the incense and olive oil that belonged to me.
26023042 “The noise of a carefree crowd was around her; drunkards were brought from the desert along with men from the rabble, and they put bracelets on the wrists of the woman and her sister and beautiful crowns on their heads.
26023043 Then I said about the one worn out by adultery, ‘Now let them use her as a prostitute, for that is all she is.’
26023044 And they slept with her. As men sleep with a prostitute, so they slept with those lewd women, Oholah and Oholibah.
26023045 But righteous judges will sentence them to the punishment of women who commit adultery and shed blood, because they are adulterous and blood is on their hands.
26023046 “This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Bring a mob against them and give them over to terror and plunder.
26023047 The mob will stone them and cut them down with their swords; they will kill their sons and daughters and burn down their houses.
26023048 “So I will put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not imitate you.
26023049 You will suffer the penalty for your lewdness and bear the consequences of your sins of idolatry. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign Lord.”
26024001 In the ninth year, in the tenth month on the tenth day, the word of the Lord came to me:
26024002 “Son of man, record this date, this very date, because the king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.
26024003 Tell this rebellious people a parable and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “ ‘Put on the cooking pot; put it on and pour water into it.
26024004 Put into it the pieces of meat, all the choice pieces—the leg and the shoulder. Fill it with the best of these bones;
26024005 take the pick of the flock. Pile wood beneath it for the bones; bring it to a boil and cook the bones in it.
26024006 “ ‘For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: “ ‘Woe to the city of bloodshed, to the pot now encrusted, whose deposit will not go away! Take the meat out piece by piece in whatever order it comes.
26024007 “ ‘For the blood she shed is in her midst: She poured it on the bare rock; she did not pour it on the ground, where the dust would cover it.
26024008 To stir up wrath and take revenge I put her blood on the bare rock, so that it would not be covered.
26024009 “ ‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: “ ‘Woe to the city of bloodshed! I, too, will pile the wood high.
26024010 So heap on the wood and kindle the fire. Cook the meat well, mixing in the spices; and let the bones be charred.
26024011 Then set the empty pot on the coals till it becomes hot and its copper glows, so that its impurities may be melted and its deposit burned away.
26024012 It has frustrated all efforts; its heavy deposit has not been removed, not even by fire.
26024013 “ ‘Now your impurity is lewdness. Because I tried to cleanse you but you would not be cleansed from your impurity, you will not be clean again until my wrath against you has subsided.
26024014 “ ‘I the Lord have spoken. The time has come for me to act. I will not hold back; I will not have pity, nor will I relent. You will be judged according to your conduct and your actions, declares the Sovereign Lord.’ ”
26024015 The word of the Lord came to me:
26024016 “Son of man, with one blow I am about to take away from you the delight of your eyes. Yet do not lament or weep or shed any tears.
26024017 Groan quietly; do not mourn for the dead. Keep your turban fastened and your sandals on your feet; do not cover your mustache and beard or eat the customary food of mourners.”
26024018 So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. The next morning I did as I had been commanded.
26024019 Then the people asked me, “Won’t you tell us what these things have to do with us? Why are you acting like this?”
26024020 So I said to them, “The word of the Lord came to me:
26024021 Say to the people of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am about to desecrate my sanctuary—the stronghold in which you take pride, the delight of your eyes, the object of your affection. The sons and daughters you left behind will fall by the sword.
26024022 And you will do as I have done. You will not cover your mustache and beard or eat the customary food of mourners.
26024023 You will keep your turbans on your heads and your sandals on your feet. You will not mourn or weep but will waste away because of your sins and groan among yourselves.
26024024 Ezekiel will be a sign to you; you will do just as he has done. When this happens, you will know that I am the Sovereign Lord.’
26024025 “And you, son of man, on the day I take away their stronghold, their joy and glory, the delight of their eyes, their heart’s desire, and their sons and daughters as well—
26024026 on that day a fugitive will come to tell you the news.
26024027 At that time your mouth will be opened; you will speak with him and will no longer be silent. So you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the Lord.”
26025001 The word of the Lord came to me:
26025002 “Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites and prophesy against them.
26025003 Say to them, ‘Hear the word of the Sovereign Lord. This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because you said “Aha!” over my sanctuary when it was desecrated and over the land of Israel when it was laid waste and over the people of Judah when they went into exile,
26025004 therefore I am going to give you to the people of the East as a possession. They will set up their camps and pitch their tents among you; they will eat your fruit and drink your milk.
26025005 I will turn Rabbah into a pasture for camels and Ammon into a resting place for sheep. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26025006 For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet, rejoicing with all the malice of your heart against the land of Israel,
26025007 therefore I will stretch out my hand against you and give you as plunder to the nations. I will wipe you out from among the nations and exterminate you from the countries. I will destroy you, and you will know that I am the Lord.’ ”
26025008 “This is what the Sovereign Lord says: ‘Because Moab and Seir said, “Look, Judah has become like all the other nations,”
26025009 therefore I will expose the flank of Moab, beginning at its frontier towns—Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon and Kiriathaim—the glory of that land.
26025010 I will give Moab along with the Ammonites to the people of the East as a possession, so that the Ammonites will not be remembered among the nations;
26025011 and I will inflict punishment on Moab. Then they will know that I am the Lord.’ ”
26025012 “This is what the Sovereign Lord says: ‘Because Edom took revenge on Judah and became very guilty by doing so,
26025013 therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will stretch out my hand against Edom and kill both man and beast. I will lay it waste, and from Teman to Dedan they will fall by the sword.
26025014 I will take vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they will deal with Edom in accordance with my anger and my wrath; they will know my vengeance, declares the Sovereign Lord.’ ”
26025015 “This is what the Sovereign Lord says: ‘Because the Philistines acted in vengeance and took revenge with malice in their hearts, and with ancient hostility sought to destroy Judah,
26025016 therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am about to stretch out my hand against the Philistines, and I will wipe out the Kerethites and destroy those remaining along the coast.
26025017 I will carry out great vengeance on them and punish them in my wrath. Then they will know that I am the Lord, when I take vengeance on them.’ ”
26026001 In the eleventh month of the twelfth year, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me:
26026002 “Son of man, because Tyre has said of Jerusalem, ‘Aha! The gate to the nations is broken, and its doors have swung open to me; now that she lies in ruins I will prosper,’
26026003 therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against you, Tyre, and I will bring many nations against you, like the sea casting up its waves.
26026004 They will destroy the walls of Tyre and pull down her towers; I will scrape away her rubble and make her a bare rock.
26026005 Out in the sea she will become a place to spread fishnets, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign Lord. She will become plunder for the nations,
26026006 and her settlements on the mainland will be ravaged by the sword. Then they will know that I am the Lord.
26026007 “For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: From the north I am going to bring against Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses and chariots, with horsemen and a great army.
26026008 He will ravage your settlements on the mainland with the sword; he will set up siege works against you, build a ramp up to your walls and raise his shields against you.
26026009 He will direct the blows of his battering rams against your walls and demolish your towers with his weapons.
26026010 His horses will be so many that they will cover you with dust. Your walls will tremble at the noise of the warhorses, wagons and chariots when he enters your gates as men enter a city whose walls have been broken through.
26026011 The hooves of his horses will trample all your streets; he will kill your people with the sword, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground.
26026012 They will plunder your wealth and loot your merchandise; they will break down your walls and demolish your fine houses and throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea.
26026013 I will put an end to your noisy songs, and the music of your harps will be heard no more.
26026014 I will make you a bare rock, and you will become a place to spread fishnets. You will never be rebuilt, for I the Lord have spoken, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26026015 “This is what the Sovereign Lord says to Tyre: Will not the coastlands tremble at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan and the slaughter takes place in you?
26026016 Then all the princes of the coast will step down from their thrones and lay aside their robes and take off their embroidered garments. Clothed with terror, they will sit on the ground, trembling every moment, appalled at you.
26026017 Then they will take up a lament concerning you and say to you: “ ‘How you are destroyed, city of renown, peopled by men of the sea! You were a power on the seas, you and your citizens; you put your terror on all who lived there.
26026018 Now the coastlands tremble on the day of your fall; the islands in the sea are terrified at your collapse.’
26026019 “This is what the Sovereign Lord says: When I make you a desolate city, like cities no longer inhabited, and when I bring the ocean depths over you and its vast waters cover you,
26026020 then I will bring you down with those who go down to the pit, to the people of long ago. I will make you dwell in the earth below, as in ancient ruins, with those who go down to the pit, and you will not return or take your place in the land of the living.
26026021 I will bring you to a horrible end and you will be no more. You will be sought, but you will never again be found, declares the Sovereign Lord.”
26027001 The word of the Lord came to me:
26027002 “Son of man, take up a lament concerning Tyre.
26027003 Say to Tyre, situated at the gateway to the sea, merchant of peoples on many coasts, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “ ‘You say, Tyre, “I am perfect in beauty.”
26027004 Your domain was on the high seas; your builders brought your beauty to perfection.
26027005 They made all your timbers of juniper from Senir ; they took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.
26027006 Of oaks from Bashan they made your oars; of cypress wood from the coasts of Cyprus they made your deck, adorned with ivory.
26027007 Fine embroidered linen from Egypt was your sail and served as your banner; your awnings were of blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah.
26027008 Men of Sidon and Arvad were your oarsmen; your skilled men, Tyre, were aboard as your sailors.
26027009 Veteran craftsmen of Byblos were on board as shipwrights to caulk your seams. All the ships of the sea and their sailors came alongside to trade for your wares.
26027010 “ ‘Men of Persia, Lydia and Put served as soldiers in your army. They hung their shields and helmets on your walls, bringing you splendor.
26027011 Men of Arvad and Helek guarded your walls on every side; men of Gammad were in your towers. They hung their shields around your walls; they brought your beauty to perfection.
26027012 “ ‘Tarshish did business with you because of your great wealth of goods; they exchanged silver, iron, tin and lead for your merchandise.
26027013 “ ‘Greece, Tubal and Meshek did business with you; they traded human beings and articles of bronze for your wares.
26027014 “ ‘Men of Beth Togarmah exchanged chariot horses, cavalry horses and mules for your merchandise.
26027015 “ ‘The men of Rhodes traded with you, and many coastlands were your customers; they paid you with ivory tusks and ebony.
26027016 “ ‘Aram did business with you because of your many products; they exchanged turquoise, purple fabric, embroidered work, fine linen, coral and rubies for your merchandise.
26027017 “ ‘Judah and Israel traded with you; they exchanged wheat from Minnith and confections, honey, olive oil and balm for your wares.
26027018 “ ‘Damascus did business with you because of your many products and great wealth of goods. They offered wine from Helbon, wool from Zahar
26027019 and casks of wine from Izal in exchange for your wares: wrought iron, cassia and calamus.
26027020 “ ‘Dedan traded in saddle blankets with you.
26027021 “ ‘Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were your customers; they did business with you in lambs, rams and goats.
26027022 “ ‘The merchants of Sheba and Raamah traded with you; for your merchandise they exchanged the finest of all kinds of spices and precious stones, and gold.
26027023 “ ‘Harran, Kanneh and Eden and merchants of Sheba, Ashur and Kilmad traded with you.
26027024 In your marketplace they traded with you beautiful garments, blue fabric, embroidered work and multicolored rugs with cords twisted and tightly knotted.
26027025 “ ‘The ships of Tarshish serve as carriers for your wares. You are filled with heavy cargo as you sail the sea.
26027026 Your oarsmen take you out to the high seas. But the east wind will break you to pieces far out at sea.
26027027 Your wealth, merchandise and wares, your mariners, sailors and shipwrights, your merchants and all your soldiers, and everyone else on board will sink into the heart of the sea on the day of your shipwreck.
26027028 The shorelands will quake when your sailors cry out.
26027029 All who handle the oars will abandon their ships; the mariners and all the sailors will stand on the shore.
26027030 They will raise their voice and cry bitterly over you; they will sprinkle dust on their heads and roll in ashes.
26027031 They will shave their heads because of you and will put on sackcloth. They will weep over you with anguish of soul and with bitter mourning.
26027032 As they wail and mourn over you, they will take up a lament concerning you: “Who was ever silenced like Tyre, surrounded by the sea?”
26027033 When your merchandise went out on the seas, you satisfied many nations; with your great wealth and your wares you enriched the kings of the earth.
26027034 Now you are shattered by the sea in the depths of the waters; your wares and all your company have gone down with you.
26027035 All who live in the coastlands are appalled at you; their kings shudder with horror and their faces are distorted with fear.
26027036 The merchants among the nations scoff at you; you have come to a horrible end and will be no more.’ ”
26028001 The word of the Lord came to me:
26028002 “Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “ ‘In the pride of your heart you say, “I am a god; I sit on the throne of a god in the heart of the seas.” But you are a mere mortal and not a god, though you think you are as wise as a god.
26028003 Are you wiser than Daniel ? Is no secret hidden from you?
26028004 By your wisdom and understanding you have gained wealth for yourself and amassed gold and silver in your treasuries.
26028005 By your great skill in trading you have increased your wealth, and because of your wealth your heart has grown proud.
26028006 “ ‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: “ ‘Because you think you are wise, as wise as a god,
26028007 I am going to bring foreigners against you, the most ruthless of nations; they will draw their swords against your beauty and wisdom and pierce your shining splendor.
26028008 They will bring you down to the pit, and you will die a violent death in the heart of the seas.
26028009 Will you then say, “I am a god,” in the presence of those who kill you? You will be but a mortal, not a god, in the hands of those who slay you.
26028010 You will die the death of the uncircumcised at the hands of foreigners. I have spoken, declares the Sovereign Lord.’ ”
26028011 The word of the Lord came to me:
26028012 “Son of man, take up a lament concerning the king of Tyre and say to him: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “ ‘You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
26028013 You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone adorned you: carnelian, chrysolite and emerald, topaz, onyx and jasper, lapis lazuli, turquoise and beryl. Your settings and mountings were made of gold; on the day you were created they were prepared.
26028014 You were anointed as a guardian cherub, for so I ordained you. You were on the holy mount of God; you walked among the fiery stones.
26028015 You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created till wickedness was found in you.
26028016 Through your widespread trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God, and I expelled you, guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones.
26028017 Your heart became proud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to the earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings.
26028018 By your many sins and dishonest trade you have desecrated your sanctuaries. So I made a fire come out from you, and it consumed you, and I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of all who were watching.
26028019 All the nations who knew you are appalled at you; you have come to a horrible end and will be no more.’ ”
26028020 The word of the Lord came to me:
26028021 “Son of man, set your face against Sidon; prophesy against her
26028022 and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “ ‘I am against you, Sidon, and among you I will display my glory. You will know that I am the Lord, when I inflict punishment on you and within you am proved to be holy.
26028023 I will send a plague upon you and make blood flow in your streets. The slain will fall within you, with the sword against you on every side. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26028024 “ ‘No longer will the people of Israel have malicious neighbors who are painful briers and sharp thorns. Then they will know that I am the Sovereign Lord.
26028025 “ ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: When I gather the people of Israel from the nations where they have been scattered, I will be proved holy through them in the sight of the nations. Then they will live in their own land, which I gave to my servant Jacob.
26028026 They will live there in safety and will build houses and plant vineyards; they will live in safety when I inflict punishment on all their neighbors who maligned them. Then they will know that I am the Lord their God.’ ”
26029001 In the tenth year, in the tenth month on the twelfth day, the word of the Lord came to me:
26029002 “Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.
26029003 Speak to him and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “ ‘I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, you great monster lying among your streams. You say, “The Nile belongs to me; I made it for myself.”
26029004 But I will put hooks in your jaws and make the fish of your streams stick to your scales. I will pull you out from among your streams, with all the fish sticking to your scales.
26029005 I will leave you in the desert, you and all the fish of your streams. You will fall on the open field and not be gathered or picked up. I will give you as food to the beasts of the earth and the birds of the sky.
26029006 Then all who live in Egypt will know that I am the Lord. “ ‘You have been a staff of reed for the people of Israel.
26029007 When they grasped you with their hands, you splintered and you tore open their shoulders; when they leaned on you, you broke and their backs were wrenched.
26029008 “ ‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will bring a sword against you and kill both man and beast.
26029009 Egypt will become a desolate wasteland. Then they will know that I am the Lord. “ ‘Because you said, “The Nile is mine; I made it,”
26029010 therefore I am against you and against your streams, and I will make the land of Egypt a ruin and a desolate waste from Migdol to Aswan, as far as the border of Cush.
26029011 The foot of neither man nor beast will pass through it; no one will live there for forty years.
26029012 I will make the land of Egypt desolate among devastated lands, and her cities will lie desolate forty years among ruined cities. And I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them through the countries.
26029013 “ ‘Yet this is what the Sovereign Lord says: At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the nations where they were scattered.
26029014 I will bring them back from captivity and return them to Upper Egypt, the land of their ancestry. There they will be a lowly kingdom.
26029015 It will be the lowliest of kingdoms and will never again exalt itself above the other nations. I will make it so weak that it will never again rule over the nations.
26029016 Egypt will no longer be a source of confidence for the people of Israel but will be a reminder of their sin in turning to her for help. Then they will know that I am the Sovereign Lord.’ ”
26029017 In the twenty-seventh year, in the first month on the first day, the word of the Lord came to me:
26029018 “Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon drove his army in a hard campaign against Tyre; every head was rubbed bare and every shoulder made raw. Yet he and his army got no reward from the campaign he led against Tyre.
26029019 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am going to give Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will carry off its wealth. He will loot and plunder the land as pay for his army.
26029020 I have given him Egypt as a reward for his efforts because he and his army did it for me, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26029021 “On that day I will make a horn grow for the Israelites, and I will open your mouth among them. Then they will know that I am the Lord.”
26030001 The word of the Lord came to me:
26030002 “Son of man, prophesy and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “ ‘Wail and say, “Alas for that day!”
26030003 For the day is near, the day of the Lord is near— a day of clouds, a time of doom for the nations.
26030004 A sword will come against Egypt, and anguish will come upon Cush. When the slain fall in Egypt, her wealth will be carried away and her foundations torn down.
26030005 Cush and Libya, Lydia and all Arabia, Kub and the people of the covenant land will fall by the sword along with Egypt.
26030006 “ ‘This is what the Lord says: “ ‘The allies of Egypt will fall and her proud strength will fail. From Migdol to Aswan they will fall by the sword within her, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26030007 “ ‘They will be desolate among desolate lands, and their cities will lie among ruined cities.
26030008 Then they will know that I am the Lord, when I set fire to Egypt and all her helpers are crushed.
26030009 “ ‘On that day messengers will go out from me in ships to frighten Cush out of her complacency. Anguish will take hold of them on the day of Egypt’s doom, for it is sure to come.
26030010 “ ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “ ‘I will put an end to the hordes of Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
26030011 He and his army—the most ruthless of nations— will be brought in to destroy the land. They will draw their swords against Egypt and fill the land with the slain.
26030012 I will dry up the waters of the Nile and sell the land to an evil nation; by the hand of foreigners I will lay waste the land and everything in it. I the Lord have spoken.
26030013 “ ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “ ‘I will destroy the idols and put an end to the images in Memphis. No longer will there be a prince in Egypt, and I will spread fear throughout the land.
26030014 I will lay waste Upper Egypt, set fire to Zoan and inflict punishment on Thebes.
26030015 I will pour out my wrath on Pelusium, the stronghold of Egypt, and wipe out the hordes of Thebes.
26030016 I will set fire to Egypt; Pelusium will writhe in agony. Thebes will be taken by storm; Memphis will be in constant distress.
26030017 The young men of Heliopolis and Bubastis will fall by the sword, and the cities themselves will go into captivity.
26030018 Dark will be the day at Tahpanhes when I break the yoke of Egypt; there her proud strength will come to an end. She will be covered with clouds, and her villages will go into captivity.
26030019 So I will inflict punishment on Egypt, and they will know that I am the Lord.’ ”
26030020 In the eleventh year, in the first month on the seventh day, the word of the Lord came to me:
26030021 “Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt. It has not been bound up to be healed or put in a splint so that it may become strong enough to hold a sword.
26030022 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt. I will break both his arms, the good arm as well as the broken one, and make the sword fall from his hand.
26030023 I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them through the countries.
26030024 I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put my sword in his hand, but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he will groan before him like a mortally wounded man.
26030025 I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh will fall limp. Then they will know that I am the Lord, when I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he brandishes it against Egypt.
26030026 I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them through the countries. Then they will know that I am the Lord.”
26031001 In the eleventh year, in the third month on the first day, the word of the Lord came to me:
26031002 “Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his hordes: “ ‘Who can be compared with you in majesty?
26031003 Consider Assyria, once a cedar in Lebanon, with beautiful branches overshadowing the forest; it towered on high, its top above the thick foliage.
26031004 The waters nourished it, deep springs made it grow tall; their streams flowed all around its base and sent their channels to all the trees of the field.
26031005 So it towered higher than all the trees of the field; its boughs increased and its branches grew long, spreading because of abundant waters.
26031006 All the birds of the sky nested in its boughs, all the animals of the wild gave birth under its branches; all the great nations lived in its shade.
26031007 It was majestic in beauty, with its spreading boughs, for its roots went down to abundant waters.
26031008 The cedars in the garden of God could not rival it, nor could the junipers equal its boughs, nor could the plane trees compare with its branches— no tree in the garden of God could match its beauty.
26031009 I made it beautiful with abundant branches, the envy of all the trees of Eden in the garden of God.
26031010 “ ‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because the great cedar towered over the thick foliage, and because it was proud of its height,
26031011 I gave it into the hands of the ruler of the nations, for him to deal with according to its wickedness. I cast it aside,
26031012 and the most ruthless of foreign nations cut it down and left it. Its boughs fell on the mountains and in all the valleys; its branches lay broken in all the ravines of the land. All the nations of the earth came out from under its shade and left it.
26031013 All the birds settled on the fallen tree, and all the wild animals lived among its branches.
26031014 Therefore no other trees by the waters are ever to tower proudly on high, lifting their tops above the thick foliage. No other trees so well-watered are ever to reach such a height; they are all destined for death, for the earth below, among mortals who go down to the realm of the dead.
26031015 “ ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: On the day it was brought down to the realm of the dead I covered the deep springs with mourning for it; I held back its streams, and its abundant waters were restrained. Because of it I clothed Lebanon with gloom, and all the trees of the field withered away.
26031016 I made the nations tremble at the sound of its fall when I brought it down to the realm of the dead to be with those who go down to the pit. Then all the trees of Eden, the choicest and best of Lebanon, the well-watered trees, were consoled in the earth below.
26031017 They too, like the great cedar, had gone down to the realm of the dead, to those killed by the sword, along with the armed men who lived in its shade among the nations.
26031018 “ ‘Which of the trees of Eden can be compared with you in splendor and majesty? Yet you, too, will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the earth below; you will lie among the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword. “ ‘This is Pharaoh and all his hordes, declares the Sovereign Lord.’ ”
26032001 In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month on the first day, the word of the Lord came to me:
26032002 “Son of man, take up a lament concerning Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him: “ ‘You are like a lion among the nations; you are like a monster in the seas thrashing about in your streams, churning the water with your feet and muddying the streams.
26032003 “ ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “ ‘With a great throng of people I will cast my net over you, and they will haul you up in my net.
26032004 I will throw you on the land and hurl you on the open field. I will let all the birds of the sky settle on you and all the animals of the wild gorge themselves on you.
26032005 I will spread your flesh on the mountains and fill the valleys with your remains.
26032006 I will drench the land with your flowing blood all the way to the mountains, and the ravines will be filled with your flesh.
26032007 When I snuff you out, I will cover the heavens and darken their stars; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon will not give its light.
26032008 All the shining lights in the heavens I will darken over you; I will bring darkness over your land, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26032009 I will trouble the hearts of many peoples when I bring about your destruction among the nations, among lands you have not known.
26032010 I will cause many peoples to be appalled at you, and their kings will shudder with horror because of you when I brandish my sword before them. On the day of your downfall each of them will tremble every moment for his life.
26032011 “ ‘For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: “ ‘The sword of the king of Babylon will come against you.
26032012 I will cause your hordes to fall by the swords of mighty men— the most ruthless of all nations. They will shatter the pride of Egypt, and all her hordes will be overthrown.
26032013 I will destroy all her cattle from beside abundant waters no longer to be stirred by the foot of man or muddied by the hooves of cattle.
26032014 Then I will let her waters settle and make her streams flow like oil, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26032015 When I make Egypt desolate and strip the land of everything in it, when I strike down all who live there, then they will know that I am the Lord.’
26032016 “This is the lament they will chant for her. The daughters of the nations will chant it; for Egypt and all her hordes they will chant it, declares the Sovereign Lord.”
26032017 In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me:
26032018 “Son of man, wail for the hordes of Egypt and consign to the earth below both her and the daughters of mighty nations, along with those who go down to the pit.
26032019 Say to them, ‘Are you more favored than others? Go down and be laid among the uncircumcised.’
26032020 They will fall among those killed by the sword. The sword is drawn; let her be dragged off with all her hordes.
26032021 From within the realm of the dead the mighty leaders will say of Egypt and her allies, ‘They have come down and they lie with the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword.’
26032022 “Assyria is there with her whole army; she is surrounded by the graves of all her slain, all who have fallen by the sword.
26032023 Their graves are in the depths of the pit and her army lies around her grave. All who had spread terror in the land of the living are slain, fallen by the sword.
26032024 “Elam is there, with all her hordes around her grave. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword. All who had spread terror in the land of the living went down uncircumcised to the earth below. They bear their shame with those who go down to the pit.
26032025 A bed is made for her among the slain, with all her hordes around her grave. All of them are uncircumcised, killed by the sword. Because their terror had spread in the land of the living, they bear their shame with those who go down to the pit; they are laid among the slain.
26032026 “Meshek and Tubal are there, with all their hordes around their graves. All of them are uncircumcised, killed by the sword because they spread their terror in the land of the living.
26032027 But they do not lie with the fallen warriors of old, who went down to the realm of the dead with their weapons of war—their swords placed under their heads and their shields resting on their bones—though these warriors also had terrorized the land of the living.
26032028 “You too, Pharaoh, will be broken and will lie among the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword.
26032029 “Edom is there, her kings and all her princes; despite their power, they are laid with those killed by the sword. They lie with the uncircumcised, with those who go down to the pit.
26032030 “All the princes of the north and all the Sidonians are there; they went down with the slain in disgrace despite the terror caused by their power. They lie uncircumcised with those killed by the sword and bear their shame with those who go down to the pit.
26032031 “Pharaoh—he and all his army—will see them and he will be consoled for all his hordes that were killed by the sword, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26032032 Although I had him spread terror in the land of the living, Pharaoh and all his hordes will be laid among the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword, declares the Sovereign Lord.”
26033001 The word of the Lord came to me:
26033002 “Son of man, speak to your people and say to them: ‘When I bring the sword against a land, and the people of the land choose one of their men and make him their watchman,
26033003 and he sees the sword coming against the land and blows the trumpet to warn the people,
26033004 then if anyone hears the trumpet but does not heed the warning and the sword comes and takes their life, their blood will be on their own head.
26033005 Since they heard the sound of the trumpet but did not heed the warning, their blood will be on their own head. If they had heeded the warning, they would have saved themselves.
26033006 But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet to warn the people and the sword comes and takes someone’s life, that person’s life will be taken because of their sin, but I will hold the watchman accountable for their blood.’
26033007 “Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me.
26033008 When I say to the wicked, ‘You wicked person, you will surely die,’ and you do not speak out to dissuade them from their ways, that wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood.
26033009 But if you do warn the wicked person to turn from their ways and they do not do so, they will die for their sin, though you yourself will be saved.
26033010 “Son of man, say to the Israelites, ‘This is what you are saying: “Our offenses and sins weigh us down, and we are wasting away because of them. How then can we live?” ’
26033011 Say to them, ‘As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, people of Israel?’
26033012 “Therefore, son of man, say to your people, ‘If someone who is righteous disobeys, that person’s former righteousness will count for nothing. And if someone who is wicked repents, that person’s former wickedness will not bring condemnation. The righteous person who sins will not be allowed to live even though they were formerly righteous.’
26033013 If I tell a righteous person that they will surely live, but then they trust in their righteousness and do evil, none of the righteous things that person has done will be remembered; they will die for the evil they have done.
26033014 And if I say to a wicked person, ‘You will surely die,’ but they then turn away from their sin and do what is just and right—
26033015 if they give back what they took in pledge for a loan, return what they have stolen, follow the decrees that give life, and do no evil—that person will surely live; they will not die.
26033016 None of the sins that person has committed will be remembered against them. They have done what is just and right; they will surely live.
26033017 “Yet your people say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ But it is their way that is not just.
26033018 If a righteous person turns from their righteousness and does evil, they will die for it.
26033019 And if a wicked person turns away from their wickedness and does what is just and right, they will live by doing so.
26033020 Yet you Israelites say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ But I will judge each of you according to your own ways.”
26033021 In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month on the fifth day, a man who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, “The city has fallen!”
26033022 Now the evening before the man arrived, the hand of the Lord was on me, and he opened my mouth before the man came to me in the morning. So my mouth was opened and I was no longer silent.
26033023 Then the word of the Lord came to me:
26033024 “Son of man, the people living in those ruins in the land of Israel are saying, ‘Abraham was only one man, yet he possessed the land. But we are many; surely the land has been given to us as our possession.’
26033025 Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Since you eat meat with the blood still in it and look to your idols and shed blood, should you then possess the land?
26033026 You rely on your sword, you do detestable things, and each of you defiles his neighbor’s wife. Should you then possess the land?’
26033027 “Say this to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: As surely as I live, those who are left in the ruins will fall by the sword, those out in the country I will give to the wild animals to be devoured, and those in strongholds and caves will die of a plague.
26033028 I will make the land a desolate waste, and her proud strength will come to an end, and the mountains of Israel will become desolate so that no one will cross them.
26033029 Then they will know that I am the Lord, when I have made the land a desolate waste because of all the detestable things they have done.’
26033030 “As for you, son of man, your people are talking together about you by the walls and at the doors of the houses, saying to each other, ‘Come and hear the message that has come from the Lord.’
26033031 My people come to you, as they usually do, and sit before you to hear your words, but they do not put them into practice. Their mouths speak of love, but their hearts are greedy for unjust gain.
26033032 Indeed, to them you are nothing more than one who sings love songs with a beautiful voice and plays an instrument well, for they hear your words but do not put them into practice.
26033033 “When all this comes true—and it surely will—then they will know that a prophet has been among them.”
26034001 The word of the Lord came to me:
26034002 “Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Woe to you shepherds of Israel who only take care of yourselves! Should not shepherds take care of the flock?
26034003 You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals, but you do not take care of the flock.
26034004 You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured. You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. You have ruled them harshly and brutally.
26034005 So they were scattered because there was no shepherd, and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild animals.
26034006 My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. They were scattered over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them.
26034007 “ ‘Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:
26034008 As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, because my flock lacks a shepherd and so has been plundered and has become food for all the wild animals, and because my shepherds did not search for my flock but cared for themselves rather than for my flock,
26034009 therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:
26034010 This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against the shepherds and will hold them accountable for my flock. I will remove them from tending the flock so that the shepherds can no longer feed themselves. I will rescue my flock from their mouths, and it will no longer be food for them.
26034011 “ ‘For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I myself will search for my sheep and look after them.
26034012 As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them, so will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness.
26034013 I will bring them out from the nations and gather them from the countries, and I will bring them into their own land. I will pasture them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines and in all the settlements in the land.
26034014 I will tend them in a good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel will be their grazing land. There they will lie down in good grazing land, and there they will feed in a rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.
26034015 I myself will tend my sheep and have them lie down, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26034016 I will search for the lost and bring back the strays. I will bind up the injured and strengthen the weak, but the sleek and the strong I will destroy. I will shepherd the flock with justice.
26034017 “ ‘As for you, my flock, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will judge between one sheep and another, and between rams and goats.
26034018 Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture? Must you also trample the rest of your pasture with your feet? Is it not enough for you to drink clear water? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet?
26034019 Must my flock feed on what you have trampled and drink what you have muddied with your feet?
26034020 “ ‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says to them: See, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
26034021 Because you shove with flank and shoulder, butting all the weak sheep with your horns until you have driven them away,
26034022 I will save my flock, and they will no longer be plundered. I will judge between one sheep and another.
26034023 I will place over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he will tend them; he will tend them and be their shepherd.
26034024 I the Lord will be their God, and my servant David will be prince among them. I the Lord have spoken.
26034025 “ ‘I will make a covenant of peace with them and rid the land of savage beasts so that they may live in the wilderness and sleep in the forests in safety.
26034026 I will make them and the places surrounding my hill a blessing. I will send down showers in season; there will be showers of blessing.
26034027 The trees will yield their fruit and the ground will yield its crops; the people will be secure in their land. They will know that I am the Lord, when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the hands of those who enslaved them.
26034028 They will no longer be plundered by the nations, nor will wild animals devour them. They will live in safety, and no one will make them afraid.
26034029 I will provide for them a land renowned for its crops, and they will no longer be victims of famine in the land or bear the scorn of the nations.
26034030 Then they will know that I, the Lord their God, am with them and that they, the Israelites, are my people, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26034031 You are my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, and I am your God, declares the Sovereign Lord.’ ”
26035001 The word of the Lord came to me:
26035002 “Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir; prophesy against it
26035003 and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you and make you a desolate waste.
26035004 I will turn your towns into ruins and you will be desolate. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26035005 “ ‘Because you harbored an ancient hostility and delivered the Israelites over to the sword at the time of their calamity, the time their punishment reached its climax,
26035006 therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I will give you over to bloodshed and it will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, bloodshed will pursue you.
26035007 I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste and cut off from it all who come and go.
26035008 I will fill your mountains with the slain; those killed by the sword will fall on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines.
26035009 I will make you desolate forever; your towns will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26035010 “ ‘Because you have said, “These two nations and countries will be ours and we will take possession of them,” even though I the Lord was there,
26035011 therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I will treat you in accordance with the anger and jealousy you showed in your hatred of them and I will make myself known among them when I judge you.
26035012 Then you will know that I the Lord have heard all the contemptible things you have said against the mountains of Israel. You said, “They have been laid waste and have been given over to us to devour.”
26035013 You boasted against me and spoke against me without restraint, and I heard it.
26035014 This is what the Sovereign Lord says: While the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.
26035015 Because you rejoiced when the inheritance of Israel became desolate, that is how I will treat you. You will be desolate, Mount Seir, you and all of Edom. Then they will know that I am the Lord.’ ”
26036001 “Son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say, ‘Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord.
26036002 This is what the Sovereign Lord says: The enemy said of you, “Aha! The ancient heights have become our possession.” ’
26036003 Therefore prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because they ravaged and crushed you from every side so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations and the object of people’s malicious talk and slander,
26036004 therefore, mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign Lord: This is what the Sovereign Lord says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, to the desolate ruins and the deserted towns that have been plundered and ridiculed by the rest of the nations around you—
26036005 this is what the Sovereign Lord says: In my burning zeal I have spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, for with glee and with malice in their hearts they made my land their own possession so that they might plunder its pastureland.’
26036006 Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I speak in my jealous wrath because you have suffered the scorn of the nations.
26036007 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I swear with uplifted hand that the nations around you will also suffer scorn.
26036008 “ ‘But you, mountains of Israel, will produce branches and fruit for my people Israel, for they will soon come home.
26036009 I am concerned for you and will look on you with favor; you will be plowed and sown,
26036010 and I will cause many people to live on you—yes, all of Israel. The towns will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt.
26036011 I will increase the number of people and animals living on you, and they will be fruitful and become numerous. I will settle people on you as in the past and will make you prosper more than before. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26036012 I will cause people, my people Israel, to live on you. They will possess you, and you will be their inheritance; you will never again deprive them of their children.
26036013 “ ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because some say to you, “You devour people and deprive your nation of its children,”
26036014 therefore you will no longer devour people or make your nation childless, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26036015 No longer will I make you hear the taunts of the nations, and no longer will you suffer the scorn of the peoples or cause your nation to fall, declares the Sovereign Lord.’ ”
26036016 Again the word of the Lord came to me:
26036017 “Son of man, when the people of Israel were living in their own land, they defiled it by their conduct and their actions. Their conduct was like a woman’s monthly uncleanness in my sight.
26036018 So I poured out my wrath on them because they had shed blood in the land and because they had defiled it with their idols.
26036019 I dispersed them among the nations, and they were scattered through the countries; I judged them according to their conduct and their actions.
26036020 And wherever they went among the nations they profaned my holy name, for it was said of them, ‘These are the Lord’s people, and yet they had to leave his land.’
26036021 I had concern for my holy name, which the people of Israel profaned among the nations where they had gone.
26036022 “Therefore say to the Israelites, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: It is not for your sake, people of Israel, that I am going to do these things, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you have gone.
26036023 I will show the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, the name you have profaned among them. Then the nations will know that I am the Lord, declares the Sovereign Lord, when I am proved holy through you before their eyes.
26036024 “ ‘For I will take you out of the nations; I will gather you from all the countries and bring you back into your own land.
26036025 I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols.
26036026 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.
26036027 And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.
26036028 Then you will live in the land I gave your ancestors; you will be my people, and I will be your God.
26036029 I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will call for the grain and make it plentiful and will not bring famine upon you.
26036030 I will increase the fruit of the trees and the crops of the field, so that you will no longer suffer disgrace among the nations because of famine.
26036031 Then you will remember your evil ways and wicked deeds, and you will loathe yourselves for your sins and detestable practices.
26036032 I want you to know that I am not doing this for your sake, declares the Sovereign Lord. Be ashamed and disgraced for your conduct, people of Israel!
26036033 “ ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: On the day I cleanse you from all your sins, I will resettle your towns, and the ruins will be rebuilt.
26036034 The desolate land will be cultivated instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass through it.
26036035 They will say, “This land that was laid waste has become like the garden of Eden; the cities that were lying in ruins, desolate and destroyed, are now fortified and inhabited.”
26036036 Then the nations around you that remain will know that I the Lord have rebuilt what was destroyed and have replanted what was desolate. I the Lord have spoken, and I will do it.’
26036037 “This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Once again I will yield to Israel’s plea and do this for them: I will make their people as numerous as sheep,
26036038 as numerous as the flocks for offerings at Jerusalem during her appointed festivals. So will the ruined cities be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that I am the Lord.”
26037001 The hand of the Lord was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord and set me in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones.
26037002 He led me back and forth among them, and I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley, bones that were very dry.
26037003 He asked me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” I said, “Sovereign Lord, you alone know.”
26037004 Then he said to me, “Prophesy to these bones and say to them, ‘Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord!
26037005 This is what the Sovereign Lord says to these bones: I will make breath enter you, and you will come to life.
26037006 I will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover you with skin; I will put breath in you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the Lord.’ ”
26037007 So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone.
26037008 I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them.
26037009 Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to it, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Come, breath, from the four winds and breathe into these slain, that they may live.’ ”
26037010 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and breath entered them; they came to life and stood up on their feet—a vast army.
26037011 Then he said to me: “Son of man, these bones are the people of Israel. They say, ‘Our bones are dried up and our hope is gone; we are cut off.’
26037012 Therefore prophesy and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: My people, I am going to open your graves and bring you up from them; I will bring you back to the land of Israel.
26037013 Then you, my people, will know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves and bring you up from them.
26037014 I will put my Spirit in you and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I the Lord have spoken, and I have done it, declares the Lord.’ ”
26037015 The word of the Lord came to me:
26037016 “Son of man, take a stick of wood and write on it, ‘Belonging to Judah and the Israelites associated with him.’ Then take another stick of wood, and write on it, ‘Belonging to Joseph (that is, to Ephraim) and all the Israelites associated with him.’
26037017 Join them together into one stick so that they will become one in your hand.
26037018 “When your people ask you, ‘Won’t you tell us what you mean by this?’
26037019 say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am going to take the stick of Joseph—which is in Ephraim’s hand—and of the Israelite tribes associated with him, and join it to Judah’s stick. I will make them into a single stick of wood, and they will become one in my hand.’
26037020 Hold before their eyes the sticks you have written on
26037021 and say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will take the Israelites out of the nations where they have gone. I will gather them from all around and bring them back into their own land.
26037022 I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. There will be one king over all of them and they will never again be two nations or be divided into two kingdoms.
26037023 They will no longer defile themselves with their idols and vile images or with any of their offenses, for I will save them from all their sinful backsliding, and I will cleanse them. They will be my people, and I will be their God.
26037024 “ ‘My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd. They will follow my laws and be careful to keep my decrees.
26037025 They will live in the land I gave to my servant Jacob, the land where your ancestors lived. They and their children and their children’s children will live there forever, and David my servant will be their prince forever.
26037026 I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant. I will establish them and increase their numbers, and I will put my sanctuary among them forever.
26037027 My dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and they will be my people.
26037028 Then the nations will know that I the Lord make Israel holy, when my sanctuary is among them forever.’ ”
26038001 The word of the Lord came to me:
26038002 “Son of man, set your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshek and Tubal; prophesy against him
26038003 and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against you, Gog, chief prince of Meshek and Tubal.
26038004 I will turn you around, put hooks in your jaws and bring you out with your whole army—your horses, your horsemen fully armed, and a great horde with large and small shields, all of them brandishing their swords.
26038005 Persia, Cush and Put will be with them, all with shields and helmets,
26038006 also Gomer with all its troops, and Beth Togarmah from the far north with all its troops—the many nations with you.
26038007 “ ‘Get ready; be prepared, you and all the hordes gathered about you, and take command of them.
26038008 After many days you will be called to arms. In future years you will invade a land that has recovered from war, whose people were gathered from many nations to the mountains of Israel, which had long been desolate. They had been brought out from the nations, and now all of them live in safety.
26038009 You and all your troops and the many nations with you will go up, advancing like a storm; you will be like a cloud covering the land.
26038010 “ ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: On that day thoughts will come into your mind and you will devise an evil scheme.
26038011 You will say, “I will invade a land of unwalled villages; I will attack a peaceful and unsuspecting people—all of them living without walls and without gates and bars.
26038012 I will plunder and loot and turn my hand against the resettled ruins and the people gathered from the nations, rich in livestock and goods, living at the center of the land. ”
26038013 Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all her villages will say to you, “Have you come to plunder? Have you gathered your hordes to loot, to carry off silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods and to seize much plunder?” ’
26038014 “Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: In that day, when my people Israel are living in safety, will you not take notice of it?
26038015 You will come from your place in the far north, you and many nations with you, all of them riding on horses, a great horde, a mighty army.
26038016 You will advance against my people Israel like a cloud that covers the land. In days to come, Gog, I will bring you against my land, so that the nations may know me when I am proved holy through you before their eyes.
26038017 “ ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: You are the one I spoke of in former days by my servants the prophets of Israel. At that time they prophesied for years that I would bring you against them.
26038018 This is what will happen in that day: When Gog attacks the land of Israel, my hot anger will be aroused, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26038019 In my zeal and fiery wrath I declare that at that time there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel.
26038020 The fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the beasts of the field, every creature that moves along the ground, and all the people on the face of the earth will tremble at my presence. The mountains will be overturned, the cliffs will crumble and every wall will fall to the ground.
26038021 I will summon a sword against Gog on all my mountains, declares the Sovereign Lord. Every man’s sword will be against his brother.
26038022 I will execute judgment on him with plague and bloodshed; I will pour down torrents of rain, hailstones and burning sulfur on him and on his troops and on the many nations with him.
26038023 And so I will show my greatness and my holiness, and I will make myself known in the sight of many nations. Then they will know that I am the Lord.’
26039001 “Son of man, prophesy against Gog and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against you, Gog, chief prince of Meshek and Tubal.
26039002 I will turn you around and drag you along. I will bring you from the far north and send you against the mountains of Israel.
26039003 Then I will strike your bow from your left hand and make your arrows drop from your right hand.
26039004 On the mountains of Israel you will fall, you and all your troops and the nations with you. I will give you as food to all kinds of carrion birds and to the wild animals.
26039005 You will fall in the open field, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26039006 I will send fire on Magog and on those who live in safety in the coastlands, and they will know that I am the Lord.
26039007 “ ‘I will make known my holy name among my people Israel. I will no longer let my holy name be profaned, and the nations will know that I the Lord am the Holy One in Israel.
26039008 It is coming! It will surely take place, declares the Sovereign Lord. This is the day I have spoken of.
26039009 “ ‘Then those who live in the towns of Israel will go out and use the weapons for fuel and burn them up—the small and large shields, the bows and arrows, the war clubs and spears. For seven years they will use them for fuel.
26039010 They will not need to gather wood from the fields or cut it from the forests, because they will use the weapons for fuel. And they will plunder those who plundered them and loot those who looted them, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26039011 “ ‘On that day I will give Gog a burial place in Israel, in the valley of those who travel east of the Sea. It will block the way of travelers, because Gog and all his hordes will be buried there. So it will be called the Valley of Hamon Gog.
26039012 “ ‘For seven months the Israelites will be burying them in order to cleanse the land.
26039013 All the people of the land will bury them, and the day I display my glory will be a memorable day for them, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26039014 People will be continually employed in cleansing the land. They will spread out across the land and, along with others, they will bury any bodies that are lying on the ground. “ ‘After the seven months they will carry out a more detailed search.
26039015 As they go through the land, anyone who sees a human bone will leave a marker beside it until the gravediggers bury it in the Valley of Hamon Gog,
26039016 near a town called Hamonah. And so they will cleanse the land.’
26039017 “Son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Call out to every kind of bird and all the wild animals: ‘Assemble and come together from all around to the sacrifice I am preparing for you, the great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel. There you will eat flesh and drink blood.
26039018 You will eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of the princes of the earth as if they were rams and lambs, goats and bulls—all of them fattened animals from Bashan.
26039019 At the sacrifice I am preparing for you, you will eat fat till you are glutted and drink blood till you are drunk.
26039020 At my table you will eat your fill of horses and riders, mighty men and soldiers of every kind,’ declares the Sovereign Lord.
26039021 “I will display my glory among the nations, and all the nations will see the punishment I inflict and the hand I lay on them.
26039022 From that day forward the people of Israel will know that I am the Lord their God.
26039023 And the nations will know that the people of Israel went into exile for their sin, because they were unfaithful to me. So I hid my face from them and handed them over to their enemies, and they all fell by the sword.
26039024 I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their offenses, and I hid my face from them.
26039025 “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will now restore the fortunes of Jacob and will have compassion on all the people of Israel, and I will be zealous for my holy name.
26039026 They will forget their shame and all the unfaithfulness they showed toward me when they lived in safety in their land with no one to make them afraid.
26039027 When I have brought them back from the nations and have gathered them from the countries of their enemies, I will be proved holy through them in the sight of many nations.
26039028 Then they will know that I am the Lord their God, for though I sent them into exile among the nations, I will gather them to their own land, not leaving any behind.
26039029 I will no longer hide my face from them, for I will pour out my Spirit on the people of Israel, declares the Sovereign Lord.”
26040001 In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the fall of the city—on that very day the hand of the Lord was on me and he took me there.
26040002 In visions of God he took me to the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, on whose south side were some buildings that looked like a city.
26040003 He took me there, and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze; he was standing in the gateway with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand.
26040004 The man said to me, “Son of man, look carefully and listen closely and pay attention to everything I am going to show you, for that is why you have been brought here. Tell the people of Israel everything you see.”
26040005 I saw a wall completely surrounding the temple area. The length of the measuring rod in the man’s hand was six long cubits, each of which was a cubit and a handbreadth. He measured the wall; it was one measuring rod thick and one rod high.
26040006 Then he went to the east gate. He climbed its steps and measured the threshold of the gate; it was one rod deep.
26040007 The alcoves for the guards were one rod long and one rod wide, and the projecting walls between the alcoves were five cubits thick. And the threshold of the gate next to the portico facing the temple was one rod deep.
26040008 Then he measured the portico of the gateway;
26040009 it was eight cubits deep and its jambs were two cubits thick. The portico of the gateway faced the temple.
26040010 Inside the east gate were three alcoves on each side; the three had the same measurements, and the faces of the projecting walls on each side had the same measurements.
26040011 Then he measured the width of the entrance of the gateway; it was ten cubits and its length was thirteen cubits.
26040012 In front of each alcove was a wall one cubit high, and the alcoves were six cubits square.
26040013 Then he measured the gateway from the top of the rear wall of one alcove to the top of the opposite one; the distance was twenty-five cubits from one parapet opening to the opposite one.
26040014 He measured along the faces of the projecting walls all around the inside of the gateway—sixty cubits. The measurement was up to the portico facing the courtyard.
26040015 The distance from the entrance of the gateway to the far end of its portico was fifty cubits.
26040016 The alcoves and the projecting walls inside the gateway were surmounted by narrow parapet openings all around, as was the portico; the openings all around faced inward. The faces of the projecting walls were decorated with palm trees.
26040017 Then he brought me into the outer court. There I saw some rooms and a pavement that had been constructed all around the court; there were thirty rooms along the pavement.
26040018 It abutted the sides of the gateways and was as wide as they were long; this was the lower pavement.
26040019 Then he measured the distance from the inside of the lower gateway to the outside of the inner court; it was a hundred cubits on the east side as well as on the north.
26040020 Then he measured the length and width of the north gate, leading into the outer court.
26040021 Its alcoves—three on each side—its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as those of the first gateway. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
26040022 Its openings, its portico and its palm tree decorations had the same measurements as those of the gate facing east. Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them.
26040023 There was a gate to the inner court facing the north gate, just as there was on the east. He measured from one gate to the opposite one; it was a hundred cubits.
26040024 Then he led me to the south side and I saw the south gate. He measured its jambs and its portico, and they had the same measurements as the others.
26040025 The gateway and its portico had narrow openings all around, like the openings of the others. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
26040026 Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them; it had palm tree decorations on the faces of the projecting walls on each side.
26040027 The inner court also had a gate facing south, and he measured from this gate to the outer gate on the south side; it was a hundred cubits.
26040028 Then he brought me into the inner court through the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it had the same measurements as the others.
26040029 Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
26040030 (The porticoes of the gateways around the inner court were twenty-five cubits wide and five cubits deep.)
26040031 Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated its jambs, and eight steps led up to it.
26040032 Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gateway; it had the same measurements as the others.
26040033 Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
26040034 Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated the jambs on either side, and eight steps led up to it.
26040035 Then he brought me to the north gate and measured it. It had the same measurements as the others,
26040036 as did its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico, and it had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
26040037 Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated the jambs on either side, and eight steps led up to it.
26040038 A room with a doorway was by the portico in each of the inner gateways, where the burnt offerings were washed.
26040039 In the portico of the gateway were two tables on each side, on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings and guilt offerings were slaughtered.
26040040 By the outside wall of the portico of the gateway, near the steps at the entrance of the north gateway were two tables, and on the other side of the steps were two tables.
26040041 So there were four tables on one side of the gateway and four on the other—eight tables in all—on which the sacrifices were slaughtered.
26040042 There were also four tables of dressed stone for the burnt offerings, each a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide and a cubit high. On them were placed the utensils for slaughtering the burnt offerings and the other sacrifices.
26040043 And double-pronged hooks, each a handbreadth long, were attached to the wall all around. The tables were for the flesh of the offerings.
26040044 Outside the inner gate, within the inner court, were two rooms, one at the side of the north gate and facing south, and another at the side of the south gate and facing north.
26040045 He said to me, “The room facing south is for the priests who guard the temple,
26040046 and the room facing north is for the priests who guard the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who are the only Levites who may draw near to the Lord to minister before him.”
26040047 Then he measured the court: It was square—a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide. And the altar was in front of the temple.
26040048 He brought me to the portico of the temple and measured the jambs of the portico; they were five cubits wide on either side. The width of the entrance was fourteen cubits and its projecting walls were three cubits wide on either side.
26040049 The portico was twenty cubits wide, and twelve cubits from front to back. It was reached by a flight of stairs, and there were pillars on each side of the jambs.
26041001 Then the man brought me to the main hall and measured the jambs; the width of the jambs was six cubits on each side.
26041002 The entrance was ten cubits wide, and the projecting walls on each side of it were five cubits wide. He also measured the main hall; it was forty cubits long and twenty cubits wide.
26041003 Then he went into the inner sanctuary and measured the jambs of the entrance; each was two cubits wide. The entrance was six cubits wide, and the projecting walls on each side of it were seven cubits wide.
26041004 And he measured the length of the inner sanctuary; it was twenty cubits, and its width was twenty cubits across the end of the main hall. He said to me, “This is the Most Holy Place.”
26041005 Then he measured the wall of the temple; it was six cubits thick, and each side room around the temple was four cubits wide.
26041006 The side rooms were on three levels, one above another, thirty on each level. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side rooms, so that the supports were not inserted into the wall of the temple.
26041007 The side rooms all around the temple were wider at each successive level. The structure surrounding the temple was built in ascending stages, so that the rooms widened as one went upward. A stairway went up from the lowest floor to the top floor through the middle floor.
26041008 I saw that the temple had a raised base all around it, forming the foundation of the side rooms. It was the length of the rod, six long cubits.
26041009 The outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits thick. The open area between the side rooms of the temple
26041010 and the priests’ rooms was twenty cubits wide all around the temple.
26041011 There were entrances to the side rooms from the open area, one on the north and another on the south; and the base adjoining the open area was five cubits wide all around.
26041012 The building facing the temple courtyard on the west side was seventy cubits wide. The wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length was ninety cubits.
26041013 Then he measured the temple; it was a hundred cubits long, and the temple courtyard and the building with its walls were also a hundred cubits long.
26041014 The width of the temple courtyard on the east, including the front of the temple, was a hundred cubits.
26041015 Then he measured the length of the building facing the courtyard at the rear of the temple, including its galleries on each side; it was a hundred cubits. The main hall, the inner sanctuary and the portico facing the court,
26041016 as well as the thresholds and the narrow windows and galleries around the three of them—everything beyond and including the threshold was covered with wood. The floor, the wall up to the windows, and the windows were covered.
26041017 In the space above the outside of the entrance to the inner sanctuary and on the walls at regular intervals all around the inner and outer sanctuary
26041018 were carved cherubim and palm trees. Palm trees alternated with cherubim. Each cherub had two faces:
26041019 the face of a human being toward the palm tree on one side and the face of a lion toward the palm tree on the other. They were carved all around the whole temple.
26041020 From the floor to the area above the entrance, cherubim and palm trees were carved on the wall of the main hall.
26041021 The main hall had a rectangular doorframe, and the one at the front of the Most Holy Place was similar.
26041022 There was a wooden altar three cubits high and two cubits square ; its corners, its base and its sides were of wood. The man said to me, “This is the table that is before the Lord.”
26041023 Both the main hall and the Most Holy Place had double doors.
26041024 Each door had two leaves—two hinged leaves for each door.
26041025 And on the doors of the main hall were carved cherubim and palm trees like those carved on the walls, and there was a wooden overhang on the front of the portico.
26041026 On the sidewalls of the portico were narrow windows with palm trees carved on each side. The side rooms of the temple also had overhangs.
26042001 Then the man led me northward into the outer court and brought me to the rooms opposite the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall on the north side.
26042002 The building whose door faced north was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide.
26042003 Both in the section twenty cubits from the inner court and in the section opposite the pavement of the outer court, gallery faced gallery at the three levels.
26042004 In front of the rooms was an inner passageway ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long. Their doors were on the north.
26042005 Now the upper rooms were narrower, for the galleries took more space from them than from the rooms on the lower and middle floors of the building.
26042006 The rooms on the top floor had no pillars, as the courts had; so they were smaller in floor space than those on the lower and middle floors.
26042007 There was an outer wall parallel to the rooms and the outer court; it extended in front of the rooms for fifty cubits.
26042008 While the row of rooms on the side next to the outer court was fifty cubits long, the row on the side nearest the sanctuary was a hundred cubits long.
26042009 The lower rooms had an entrance on the east side as one enters them from the outer court.
26042010 On the south side along the length of the wall of the outer court, adjoining the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall, were rooms
26042011 with a passageway in front of them. These were like the rooms on the north; they had the same length and width, with similar exits and dimensions. Similar to the doorways on the north
26042012 were the doorways of the rooms on the south. There was a doorway at the beginning of the passageway that was parallel to the corresponding wall extending eastward, by which one enters the rooms.
26042013 Then he said to me, “The north and south rooms facing the temple courtyard are the priests’ rooms, where the priests who approach the Lord will eat the most holy offerings. There they will put the most holy offerings—the grain offerings, the sin offerings and the guilt offerings—for the place is holy.
26042014 Once the priests enter the holy precincts, they are not to go into the outer court until they leave behind the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They are to put on other clothes before they go near the places that are for the people.”
26042015 When he had finished measuring what was inside the temple area, he led me out by the east gate and measured the area all around:
26042016 He measured the east side with the measuring rod; it was five hundred cubits.
26042017 He measured the north side; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.
26042018 He measured the south side; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.
26042019 Then he turned to the west side and measured; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.
26042020 So he measured the area on all four sides. It had a wall around it, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits wide, to separate the holy from the common.
26043001 Then the man brought me to the gate facing east,
26043002 and I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east. His voice was like the roar of rushing waters, and the land was radiant with his glory.
26043003 The vision I saw was like the vision I had seen when he came to destroy the city and like the visions I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown.
26043004 The glory of the Lord entered the temple through the gate facing east.
26043005 Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court, and the glory of the Lord filled the temple.
26043006 While the man was standing beside me, I heard someone speaking to me from inside the temple.
26043007 He said: “Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet. This is where I will live among the Israelites forever. The people of Israel will never again defile my holy name—neither they nor their kings—by their prostitution and the funeral offerings for their kings at their death.
26043008 When they placed their threshold next to my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them, they defiled my holy name by their detestable practices. So I destroyed them in my anger.
26043009 Now let them put away from me their prostitution and the funeral offerings for their kings, and I will live among them forever.
26043010 “Son of man, describe the temple to the people of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their sins. Let them consider its perfection,
26043011 and if they are ashamed of all they have done, make known to them the design of the temple—its arrangement, its exits and entrances—its whole design and all its regulations and laws. Write these down before them so that they may be faithful to its design and follow all its regulations.
26043012 “This is the law of the temple: All the surrounding area on top of the mountain will be most holy. Such is the law of the temple.
26043013 “These are the measurements of the altar in long cubits, that cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth: Its gutter is a cubit deep and a cubit wide, with a rim of one span around the edge. And this is the height of the altar:
26043014 From the gutter on the ground up to the lower ledge that goes around the altar it is two cubits high, and the ledge is a cubit wide. From this lower ledge to the upper ledge that goes around the altar it is four cubits high, and that ledge is also a cubit wide.
26043015 Above that, the altar hearth is four cubits high, and four horns project upward from the hearth.
26043016 The altar hearth is square, twelve cubits long and twelve cubits wide.
26043017 The upper ledge also is square, fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits wide. All around the altar is a gutter of one cubit with a rim of half a cubit. The steps of the altar face east.”
26043018 Then he said to me, “Son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: These will be the regulations for sacrificing burnt offerings and splashing blood against the altar when it is built:
26043019 You are to give a young bull as a sin offering to the Levitical priests of the family of Zadok, who come near to minister before me, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26043020 You are to take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar and on the four corners of the upper ledge and all around the rim, and so purify the altar and make atonement for it.
26043021 You are to take the bull for the sin offering and burn it in the designated part of the temple area outside the sanctuary.
26043022 “On the second day you are to offer a male goat without defect for a sin offering, and the altar is to be purified as it was purified with the bull.
26043023 When you have finished purifying it, you are to offer a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without defect.
26043024 You are to offer them before the Lord, and the priests are to sprinkle salt on them and sacrifice them as a burnt offering to the Lord.
26043025 “For seven days you are to provide a male goat daily for a sin offering; you are also to provide a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without defect.
26043026 For seven days they are to make atonement for the altar and cleanse it; thus they will dedicate it.
26043027 At the end of these days, from the eighth day on, the priests are to present your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar. Then I will accept you, declares the Sovereign Lord.”
26044001 Then the man brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, the one facing east, and it was shut.
26044002 The Lord said to me, “This gate is to remain shut. It must not be opened; no one may enter through it. It is to remain shut because the Lord, the God of Israel, has entered through it.
26044003 The prince himself is the only one who may sit inside the gateway to eat in the presence of the Lord. He is to enter by way of the portico of the gateway and go out the same way.”
26044004 Then the man brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple. I looked and saw the glory of the Lord filling the temple of the Lord, and I fell facedown.
26044005 The Lord said to me, “Son of man, look carefully, listen closely and give attention to everything I tell you concerning all the regulations and instructions regarding the temple of the Lord. Give attention to the entrance to the temple and all the exits of the sanctuary.
26044006 Say to rebellious Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Enough of your detestable practices, people of Israel!
26044007 In addition to all your other detestable practices, you brought foreigners uncircumcised in heart and flesh into my sanctuary, desecrating my temple while you offered me food, fat and blood, and you broke my covenant.
26044008 Instead of carrying out your duty in regard to my holy things, you put others in charge of my sanctuary.
26044009 This is what the Sovereign Lord says: No foreigner uncircumcised in heart and flesh is to enter my sanctuary, not even the foreigners who live among the Israelites.
26044010 “ ‘The Levites who went far from me when Israel went astray and who wandered from me after their idols must bear the consequences of their sin.
26044011 They may serve in my sanctuary, having charge of the gates of the temple and serving in it; they may slaughter the burnt offerings and sacrifices for the people and stand before the people and serve them.
26044012 But because they served them in the presence of their idols and made the people of Israel fall into sin, therefore I have sworn with uplifted hand that they must bear the consequences of their sin, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26044013 They are not to come near to serve me as priests or come near any of my holy things or my most holy offerings; they must bear the shame of their detestable practices.
26044014 And I will appoint them to guard the temple for all the work that is to be done in it.
26044015 “ ‘But the Levitical priests, who are descendants of Zadok and who guarded my sanctuary when the Israelites went astray from me, are to come near to minister before me; they are to stand before me to offer sacrifices of fat and blood, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26044016 They alone are to enter my sanctuary; they alone are to come near my table to minister before me and serve me as guards.
26044017 “ ‘When they enter the gates of the inner court, they are to wear linen clothes; they must not wear any woolen garment while ministering at the gates of the inner court or inside the temple.
26044018 They are to wear linen turbans on their heads and linen undergarments around their waists. They must not wear anything that makes them perspire.
26044019 When they go out into the outer court where the people are, they are to take off the clothes they have been ministering in and are to leave them in the sacred rooms, and put on other clothes, so that the people are not consecrated through contact with their garments.
26044020 “ ‘They must not shave their heads or let their hair grow long, but they are to keep the hair of their heads trimmed.
26044021 No priest is to drink wine when he enters the inner court.
26044022 They must not marry widows or divorced women; they may marry only virgins of Israelite descent or widows of priests.
26044023 They are to teach my people the difference between the holy and the common and show them how to distinguish between the unclean and the clean.
26044024 “ ‘In any dispute, the priests are to serve as judges and decide it according to my ordinances. They are to keep my laws and my decrees for all my appointed festivals, and they are to keep my Sabbaths holy.
26044025 “ ‘A priest must not defile himself by going near a dead person; however, if the dead person was his father or mother, son or daughter, brother or unmarried sister, then he may defile himself.
26044026 After he is cleansed, he must wait seven days.
26044027 On the day he goes into the inner court of the sanctuary to minister in the sanctuary, he is to offer a sin offering for himself, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26044028 “ ‘I am to be the only inheritance the priests have. You are to give them no possession in Israel; I will be their possession.
26044029 They will eat the grain offerings, the sin offerings and the guilt offerings; and everything in Israel devoted to the Lord will belong to them.
26044030 The best of all the firstfruits and of all your special gifts will belong to the priests. You are to give them the first portion of your ground meal so that a blessing may rest on your household.
26044031 The priests must not eat anything, whether bird or animal, found dead or torn by wild animals.
26045001 “ ‘When you allot the land as an inheritance, you are to present to the Lord a portion of the land as a sacred district, 25,000 cubits long and 20,000 cubits wide; the entire area will be holy.
26045002 Of this, a section 500 cubits square is to be for the sanctuary, with 50 cubits around it for open land.
26045003 In the sacred district, measure off a section 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide. In it will be the sanctuary, the Most Holy Place.
26045004 It will be the sacred portion of the land for the priests, who minister in the sanctuary and who draw near to minister before the Lord. It will be a place for their houses as well as a holy place for the sanctuary.
26045005 An area 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide will belong to the Levites, who serve in the temple, as their possession for towns to live in.
26045006 “ ‘You are to give the city as its property an area 5,000 cubits wide and 25,000 cubits long, adjoining the sacred portion; it will belong to all Israel.
26045007 “ ‘The prince will have the land bordering each side of the area formed by the sacred district and the property of the city. It will extend westward from the west side and eastward from the east side, running lengthwise from the western to the eastern border parallel to one of the tribal portions.
26045008 This land will be his possession in Israel. And my princes will no longer oppress my people but will allow the people of Israel to possess the land according to their tribes.
26045009 “ ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: You have gone far enough, princes of Israel! Give up your violence and oppression and do what is just and right. Stop dispossessing my people, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26045010 You are to use accurate scales, an accurate ephah and an accurate bath.
26045011 The ephah and the bath are to be the same size, the bath containing a tenth of a homer and the ephah a tenth of a homer; the homer is to be the standard measure for both.
26045012 The shekel is to consist of twenty gerahs. Twenty shekels plus twenty-five shekels plus fifteen shekels equal one mina.
26045013 “ ‘This is the special gift you are to offer: a sixth of an ephah from each homer of wheat and a sixth of an ephah from each homer of barley.
26045014 The prescribed portion of olive oil, measured by the bath, is a tenth of a bath from each cor (which consists of ten baths or one homer, for ten baths are equivalent to a homer).
26045015 Also one sheep is to be taken from every flock of two hundred from the well-watered pastures of Israel. These will be used for the grain offerings, burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to make atonement for the people, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26045016 All the people of the land will be required to give this special offering to the prince in Israel.
26045017 It will be the duty of the prince to provide the burnt offerings, grain offerings and drink offerings at the festivals, the New Moons and the Sabbaths—at all the appointed festivals of Israel. He will provide the sin offerings, grain offerings, burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to make atonement for the Israelites.
26045018 “ ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: In the first month on the first day you are to take a young bull without defect and purify the sanctuary.
26045019 The priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the temple, on the four corners of the upper ledge of the altar and on the gateposts of the inner court.
26045020 You are to do the same on the seventh day of the month for anyone who sins unintentionally or through ignorance; so you are to make atonement for the temple.
26045021 “ ‘In the first month on the fourteenth day you are to observe the Passover, a festival lasting seven days, during which you shall eat bread made without yeast.
26045022 On that day the prince is to provide a bull as a sin offering for himself and for all the people of the land.
26045023 Every day during the seven days of the festival he is to provide seven bulls and seven rams without defect as a burnt offering to the Lord, and a male goat for a sin offering.
26045024 He is to provide as a grain offering an ephah for each bull and an ephah for each ram, along with a hin of olive oil for each ephah.
26045025 “ ‘During the seven days of the festival, which begins in the seventh month on the fifteenth day, he is to make the same provision for sin offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings and oil.
26046001 “ ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: The gate of the inner court facing east is to be shut on the six working days, but on the Sabbath day and on the day of the New Moon it is to be opened.
26046002 The prince is to enter from the outside through the portico of the gateway and stand by the gatepost. The priests are to sacrifice his burnt offering and his fellowship offerings. He is to bow down in worship at the threshold of the gateway and then go out, but the gate will not be shut until evening.
26046003 On the Sabbaths and New Moons the people of the land are to worship in the presence of the Lord at the entrance of that gateway.
26046004 The burnt offering the prince brings to the Lord on the Sabbath day is to be six male lambs and a ram, all without defect.
26046005 The grain offering given with the ram is to be an ephah, and the grain offering with the lambs is to be as much as he pleases, along with a hin of olive oil for each ephah.
26046006 On the day of the New Moon he is to offer a young bull, six lambs and a ram, all without defect.
26046007 He is to provide as a grain offering one ephah with the bull, one ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he wants to give, along with a hin of oil for each ephah.
26046008 When the prince enters, he is to go in through the portico of the gateway, and he is to come out the same way.
26046009 “ ‘When the people of the land come before the Lord at the appointed festivals, whoever enters by the north gate to worship is to go out the south gate; and whoever enters by the south gate is to go out the north gate. No one is to return through the gate by which they entered, but each is to go out the opposite gate.
26046010 The prince is to be among them, going in when they go in and going out when they go out.
26046011 At the feasts and the appointed festivals, the grain offering is to be an ephah with a bull, an ephah with a ram, and with the lambs as much as he pleases, along with a hin of oil for each ephah.
26046012 “ ‘When the prince provides a freewill offering to the Lord—whether a burnt offering or fellowship offerings—the gate facing east is to be opened for him. He shall offer his burnt offering or his fellowship offerings as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he has gone out, the gate will be shut.
26046013 “ ‘Every day you are to provide a year-old lamb without defect for a burnt offering to the Lord; morning by morning you shall provide it.
26046014 You are also to provide with it morning by morning a grain offering, consisting of a sixth of an ephah with a third of a hin of oil to moisten the flour. The presenting of this grain offering to the Lord is a lasting ordinance.
26046015 So the lamb and the grain offering and the oil shall be provided morning by morning for a regular burnt offering.
26046016 “ ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: If the prince makes a gift from his inheritance to one of his sons, it will also belong to his descendants; it is to be their property by inheritance.
26046017 If, however, he makes a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, the servant may keep it until the year of freedom; then it will revert to the prince. His inheritance belongs to his sons only; it is theirs.
26046018 The prince must not take any of the inheritance of the people, driving them off their property. He is to give his sons their inheritance out of his own property, so that not one of my people will be separated from their property.’ ”
26046019 Then the man brought me through the entrance at the side of the gate to the sacred rooms facing north, which belonged to the priests, and showed me a place at the western end.
26046020 He said to me, “This is the place where the priests are to cook the guilt offering and the sin offering and bake the grain offering, to avoid bringing them into the outer court and consecrating the people.”
26046021 He then brought me to the outer court and led me around to its four corners, and I saw in each corner another court.
26046022 In the four corners of the outer court were enclosed courts, forty cubits long and thirty cubits wide; each of the courts in the four corners was the same size.
26046023 Around the inside of each of the four courts was a ledge of stone, with places for fire built all around under the ledge.
26046024 He said to me, “These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple are to cook the sacrifices of the people.”
26047001 The man brought me back to the entrance to the temple, and I saw water coming out from under the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was coming down from under the south side of the temple, south of the altar.
26047002 He then brought me out through the north gate and led me around the outside to the outer gate facing east, and the water was trickling from the south side.
26047003 As the man went eastward with a measuring line in his hand, he measured off a thousand cubits and then led me through water that was ankle-deep.
26047004 He measured off another thousand cubits and led me through water that was knee-deep. He measured off another thousand and led me through water that was up to the waist.
26047005 He measured off another thousand, but now it was a river that I could not cross, because the water had risen and was deep enough to swim in—a river that no one could cross.
26047006 He asked me, “Son of man, do you see this?” Then he led me back to the bank of the river.
26047007 When I arrived there, I saw a great number of trees on each side of the river.
26047008 He said to me, “This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah, where it enters the Dead Sea. When it empties into the sea, the salty water there becomes fresh.
26047009 Swarms of living creatures will live wherever the river flows. There will be large numbers of fish, because this water flows there and makes the salt water fresh; so where the river flows everything will live.
26047010 Fishermen will stand along the shore; from En Gedi to En Eglaim there will be places for spreading nets. The fish will be of many kinds—like the fish of the Mediterranean Sea.
26047011 But the swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be left for salt.
26047012 Fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river. Their leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail. Every month they will bear fruit, because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing.”
26047013 This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “These are the boundaries of the land that you will divide among the twelve tribes of Israel as their inheritance, with two portions for Joseph.
26047014 You are to divide it equally among them. Because I swore with uplifted hand to give it to your ancestors, this land will become your inheritance.
26047015 “This is to be the boundary of the land: “On the north side it will run from the Mediterranean Sea by the Hethlon road past Lebo Hamath to Zedad,
26047016 Berothah and Sibraim (which lies on the border between Damascus and Hamath), as far as Hazer Hattikon, which is on the border of Hauran.
26047017 The boundary will extend from the sea to Hazar Enan, along the northern border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north. This will be the northern boundary.
26047018 “On the east side the boundary will run between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel, to the Dead Sea and as far as Tamar. This will be the eastern boundary.
26047019 “On the south side it will run from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribah Kadesh, then along the Wadi of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. This will be the southern boundary.
26047020 “On the west side, the Mediterranean Sea will be the boundary to a point opposite Lebo Hamath. This will be the western boundary.
26047021 “You are to distribute this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.
26047022 You are to allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the foreigners residing among you and who have children. You are to consider them as native-born Israelites; along with you they are to be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
26047023 In whatever tribe a foreigner resides, there you are to give them their inheritance,” declares the Sovereign Lord.
26048001 “These are the tribes, listed by name: At the northern frontier, Dan will have one portion; it will follow the Hethlon road to Lebo Hamath; Hazar Enan and the northern border of Damascus next to Hamath will be part of its border from the east side to the west side.
26048002 “Asher will have one portion; it will border the territory of Dan from east to west.
26048003 “Naphtali will have one portion; it will border the territory of Asher from east to west.
26048004 “Manasseh will have one portion; it will border the territory of Naphtali from east to west.
26048005 “Ephraim will have one portion; it will border the territory of Manasseh from east to west.
26048006 “Reuben will have one portion; it will border the territory of Ephraim from east to west.
26048007 “Judah will have one portion; it will border the territory of Reuben from east to west.
26048008 “Bordering the territory of Judah from east to west will be the portion you are to present as a special gift. It will be 25,000 cubits wide, and its length from east to west will equal one of the tribal portions; the sanctuary will be in the center of it.
26048009 “The special portion you are to offer to the Lord will be 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide.
26048010 This will be the sacred portion for the priests. It will be 25,000 cubits long on the north side, 10,000 cubits wide on the west side, 10,000 cubits wide on the east side and 25,000 cubits long on the south side. In the center of it will be the sanctuary of the Lord.
26048011 This will be for the consecrated priests, the Zadokites, who were faithful in serving me and did not go astray as the Levites did when the Israelites went astray.
26048012 It will be a special gift to them from the sacred portion of the land, a most holy portion, bordering the territory of the Levites.
26048013 “Alongside the territory of the priests, the Levites will have an allotment 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide. Its total length will be 25,000 cubits and its width 10,000 cubits.
26048014 They must not sell or exchange any of it. This is the best of the land and must not pass into other hands, because it is holy to the Lord.
26048015 “The remaining area, 5,000 cubits wide and 25,000 cubits long, will be for the common use of the city, for houses and for pastureland. The city will be in the center of it
26048016 and will have these measurements: the north side 4,500 cubits, the south side 4,500 cubits, the east side 4,500 cubits, and the west side 4,500 cubits.
26048017 The pastureland for the city will be 250 cubits on the north, 250 cubits on the south, 250 cubits on the east, and 250 cubits on the west.
26048018 What remains of the area, bordering on the sacred portion and running the length of it, will be 10,000 cubits on the east side and 10,000 cubits on the west side. Its produce will supply food for the workers of the city.
26048019 The workers from the city who farm it will come from all the tribes of Israel.
26048020 The entire portion will be a square, 25,000 cubits on each side. As a special gift you will set aside the sacred portion, along with the property of the city.
26048021 “What remains on both sides of the area formed by the sacred portion and the property of the city will belong to the prince. It will extend eastward from the 25,000 cubits of the sacred portion to the eastern border, and westward from the 25,000 cubits to the western border. Both these areas running the length of the tribal portions will belong to the prince, and the sacred portion with the temple sanctuary will be in the center of them.
26048022 So the property of the Levites and the property of the city will lie in the center of the area that belongs to the prince. The area belonging to the prince will lie between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin.
26048023 “As for the rest of the tribes: Benjamin will have one portion; it will extend from the east side to the west side.
26048024 “Simeon will have one portion; it will border the territory of Benjamin from east to west.
26048025 “Issachar will have one portion; it will border the territory of Simeon from east to west.
26048026 “Zebulun will have one portion; it will border the territory of Issachar from east to west.
26048027 “Gad will have one portion; it will border the territory of Zebulun from east to west.
26048028 “The southern boundary of Gad will run south from Tamar to the waters of Meribah Kadesh, then along the Wadi of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea.
26048029 “This is the land you are to allot as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel, and these will be their portions,” declares the Sovereign Lord.
26048030 “These will be the exits of the city: Beginning on the north side, which is 4,500 cubits long,
26048031 the gates of the city will be named after the tribes of Israel. The three gates on the north side will be the gate of Reuben, the gate of Judah and the gate of Levi.
26048032 “On the east side, which is 4,500 cubits long, will be three gates: the gate of Joseph, the gate of Benjamin and the gate of Dan.
26048033 “On the south side, which measures 4,500 cubits, will be three gates: the gate of Simeon, the gate of Issachar and the gate of Zebulun.
26048034 “On the west side, which is 4,500 cubits long, will be three gates: the gate of Gad, the gate of Asher and the gate of Naphtali.
26048035 “The distance all around will be 18,000 cubits. “And the name of the city from that time on will be: the Lord is there.”
27001001 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.
27001002 And the Lord delivered Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, along with some of the articles from the temple of God. These he carried off to the temple of his god in Babylonia and put in the treasure house of his god.
27001003 Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, chief of his court officials, to bring into the king’s service some of the Israelites from the royal family and the nobility—
27001004 young men without any physical defect, handsome, showing aptitude for every kind of learning, well informed, quick to understand, and qualified to serve in the king’s palace. He was to teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians.
27001005 The king assigned them a daily amount of food and wine from the king’s table. They were to be trained for three years, and after that they were to enter the king’s service.
27001006 Among those who were chosen were some from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.
27001007 The chief official gave them new names: to Daniel, the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego.
27001008 But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine, and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself this way.
27001009 Now God had caused the official to show favor and compassion to Daniel,
27001010 but the official told Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord the king, who has assigned your food and drink. Why should he see you looking worse than the other young men your age? The king would then have my head because of you.”
27001011 Daniel then said to the guard whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah,
27001012 “Please test your servants for ten days: Give us nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink.
27001013 Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food, and treat your servants in accordance with what you see.”
27001014 So he agreed to this and tested them for ten days.
27001015 At the end of the ten days they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food.
27001016 So the guard took away their choice food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables instead.
27001017 To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds.
27001018 At the end of the time set by the king to bring them into his service, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar.
27001019 The king talked with them, and he found none equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king’s service.
27001020 In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom.
27001021 And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.
27002001 In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his mind was troubled and he could not sleep.
27002002 So the king summoned the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers to tell him what he had dreamed. When they came in and stood before the king,
27002003 he said to them, “I have had a dream that troubles me and I want to know what it means. ”
27002004 Then the astrologers answered the king, “May the king live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it.”
27002005 The king replied to the astrologers, “This is what I have firmly decided: If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it, I will have you cut into pieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble.
27002006 But if you tell me the dream and explain it, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and interpret it for me.”
27002007 Once more they replied, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it.”
27002008 Then the king answered, “I am certain that you are trying to gain time, because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided:
27002009 If you do not tell me the dream, there is only one penalty for you. You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the situation will change. So then, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can interpret it for me.”
27002010 The astrologers answered the king, “There is no one on earth who can do what the king asks! No king, however great and mighty, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer.
27002011 What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among humans.”
27002012 This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon.
27002013 So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death.
27002014 When Arioch, the commander of the king’s guard, had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact.
27002015 He asked the king’s officer, “Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?” Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel.
27002016 At this, Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him.
27002017 Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.
27002018 He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
27002019 During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven
27002020 and said: “Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever; wisdom and power are his.
27002021 He changes times and seasons; he deposes kings and raises up others. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning.
27002022 He reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with him.
27002023 I thank and praise you, God of my ancestors: You have given me wisdom and power, you have made known to me what we asked of you, you have made known to us the dream of the king.”
27002024 Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, “Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him.”
27002025 Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said, “I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means.”
27002026 The king asked Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), “Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?”
27002027 Daniel replied, “No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about,
27002028 but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you were lying in bed are these:
27002029 “As Your Majesty was lying there, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen.
27002030 As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than anyone else alive, but so that Your Majesty may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind.
27002031 “Your Majesty looked, and there before you stood a large statue—an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance.
27002032 The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze,
27002033 its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay.
27002034 While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them.
27002035 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth.
27002036 “This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king.
27002037 Your Majesty, you are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory;
27002038 in your hands he has placed all mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds in the sky. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold.
27002039 “After you, another kingdom will arise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth.
27002040 Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron—for iron breaks and smashes everything—and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others.
27002041 Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay.
27002042 As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle.
27002043 And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay.
27002044 “In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever.
27002045 This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands—a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces. “The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true and its interpretation is trustworthy.”
27002046 Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him.
27002047 The king said to Daniel, “Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery.”
27002048 Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men.
27002049 Moreover, at Daniel’s request the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego administrators over the province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained at the royal court.
27003001 King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, sixty cubits high and six cubits wide, and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.
27003002 He then summoned the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials to come to the dedication of the image he had set up.
27003003 So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it.
27003004 Then the herald loudly proclaimed, “Nations and peoples of every language, this is what you are commanded to do:
27003005 As soon as you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.
27003006 Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace.”
27003007 Therefore, as soon as they heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp and all kinds of music, all the nations and peoples of every language fell down and worshiped the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
27003008 At this time some astrologers came forward and denounced the Jews.
27003009 They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “May the king live forever!
27003010 Your Majesty has issued a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the image of gold,
27003011 and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace.
27003012 But there are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego—who pay no attention to you, Your Majesty. They neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up.”
27003013 Furious with rage, Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king,
27003014 and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the image of gold I have set up?
27003015 Now when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe and all kinds of music, if you are ready to fall down and worship the image I made, very good. But if you do not worship it, you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace. Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?”
27003016 Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to him, “King Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter.
27003017 If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to deliver us from it, and he will deliver us from Your Majesty’s hand.
27003018 But even if he does not, we want you to know, Your Majesty, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up.”
27003019 Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, and his attitude toward them changed. He ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual
27003020 and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace.
27003021 So these men, wearing their robes, trousers, turbans and other clothes, were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace.
27003022 The king’s command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego,
27003023 and these three men, firmly tied, fell into the blazing furnace.
27003024 Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisers, “Weren’t there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?” They replied, “Certainly, Your Majesty.”
27003025 He said, “Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.”
27003026 Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!” So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire,
27003027 and the satraps, prefects, governors and royal advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed; their robes were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them.
27003028 Then Nebuchadnezzar said, “Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent his angel and rescued his servants! They trusted in him and defied the king’s command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.
27003029 Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble, for no other god can save in this way.”
27003030 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
27004001 King Nebuchadnezzar, To the nations and peoples of every language, who live in all the earth: May you prosper greatly!
27004002 It is my pleasure to tell you about the miraculous signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed for me.
27004003 How great are his signs, how mighty his wonders! His kingdom is an eternal kingdom; his dominion endures from generation to generation.
27004004 I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at home in my palace, contented and prosperous.
27004005 I had a dream that made me afraid. As I was lying in bed, the images and visions that passed through my mind terrified me.
27004006 So I commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be brought before me to interpret the dream for me.
27004007 When the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners came, I told them the dream, but they could not interpret it for me.
27004008 Finally, Daniel came into my presence and I told him the dream. (He is called Belteshazzar, after the name of my god, and the spirit of the holy gods is in him.)
27004009 I said, “Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no mystery is too difficult for you. Here is my dream; interpret it for me.
27004010 These are the visions I saw while lying in bed: I looked, and there before me stood a tree in the middle of the land. Its height was enormous.
27004011 The tree grew large and strong and its top touched the sky; it was visible to the ends of the earth.
27004012 Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit abundant, and on it was food for all. Under it the wild animals found shelter, and the birds lived in its branches; from it every creature was fed.
27004013 “In the visions I saw while lying in bed, I looked, and there before me was a holy one, a messenger, coming down from heaven.
27004014 He called in a loud voice: ‘Cut down the tree and trim off its branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals flee from under it and the birds from its branches.
27004015 But let the stump and its roots, bound with iron and bronze, remain in the ground, in the grass of the field. “ ‘Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth.
27004016 Let his mind be changed from that of a man and let him be given the mind of an animal, till seven times pass by for him.
27004017 “ ‘The decision is announced by messengers, the holy ones declare the verdict, so that the living may know that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone he wishes and sets over them the lowliest of people.’
27004018 “This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me what it means, for none of the wise men in my kingdom can interpret it for me. But you can, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.”
27004019 Then Daniel (also called Belteshazzar) was greatly perplexed for a time, and his thoughts terrified him. So the king said, “Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its meaning alarm you.” Belteshazzar answered, “My lord, if only the dream applied to your enemies and its meaning to your adversaries!
27004020 The tree you saw, which grew large and strong, with its top touching the sky, visible to the whole earth,
27004021 with beautiful leaves and abundant fruit, providing food for all, giving shelter to the wild animals, and having nesting places in its branches for the birds—
27004022 Your Majesty, you are that tree! You have become great and strong; your greatness has grown until it reaches the sky, and your dominion extends to distant parts of the earth.
27004023 “Your Majesty saw a holy one, a messenger, coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump, bound with iron and bronze, in the grass of the field, while its roots remain in the ground. Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven; let him live with the wild animals, until seven times pass by for him.’
27004024 “This is the interpretation, Your Majesty, and this is the decree the Most High has issued against my lord the king:
27004025 You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like the ox and be drenched with the dew of heaven. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone he wishes.
27004026 The command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you when you acknowledge that Heaven rules.
27004027 Therefore, Your Majesty, be pleased to accept my advice: Renounce your sins by doing what is right, and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed. It may be that then your prosperity will continue.”
27004028 All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.
27004029 Twelve months later, as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,
27004030 he said, “Is not this the great Babylon I have built as the royal residence, by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?”
27004031 Even as the words were on his lips, a voice came from heaven, “This is what is decreed for you, King Nebuchadnezzar: Your royal authority has been taken from you.
27004032 You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like the ox. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone he wishes.”
27004033 Immediately what had been said about Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from people and ate grass like the ox. His body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird.
27004034 At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was restored. Then I praised the Most High; I honored and glorified him who lives forever. His dominion is an eternal dominion; his kingdom endures from generation to generation.
27004035 All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing. He does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth. No one can hold back his hand or say to him: “What have you done?”
27004036 At the same time that my sanity was restored, my honor and splendor were returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored to my throne and became even greater than before.
27004037 Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, because everything he does is right and all his ways are just. And those who walk in pride he is able to humble.
27005001 King Belshazzar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine with them.
27005002 While Belshazzar was drinking his wine, he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines might drink from them.
27005003 So they brought in the gold goblets that had been taken from the temple of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines drank from them.
27005004 As they drank the wine, they praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone.
27005005 Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote.
27005006 His face turned pale and he was so frightened that his legs became weak and his knees were knocking.
27005007 The king summoned the enchanters, astrologers and diviners. Then he said to these wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this writing and tells me what it means will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around his neck, and he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”
27005008 Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or tell the king what it meant.
27005009 So King Belshazzar became even more terrified and his face grew more pale. His nobles were baffled.
27005010 The queen, hearing the voices of the king and his nobles, came into the banquet hall. “May the king live forever!” she said. “Don’t be alarmed! Don’t look so pale!
27005011 There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the time of your father he was found to have insight and intelligence and wisdom like that of the gods. Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners.
27005012 He did this because Daniel, whom the king called Belteshazzar, was found to have a keen mind and knowledge and understanding, and also the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles and solve difficult problems. Call for Daniel, and he will tell you what the writing means.”
27005013 So Daniel was brought before the king, and the king said to him, “Are you Daniel, one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah?
27005014 I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you have insight, intelligence and outstanding wisdom.
27005015 The wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this writing and tell me what it means, but they could not explain it.
27005016 Now I have heard that you are able to give interpretations and to solve difficult problems. If you can read this writing and tell me what it means, you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around your neck, and you will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”
27005017 Then Daniel answered the king, “You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the writing for the king and tell him what it means.
27005018 “Your Majesty, the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and greatness and glory and splendor.
27005019 Because of the high position he gave him, all the nations and peoples of every language dreaded and feared him. Those the king wanted to put to death, he put to death; those he wanted to spare, he spared; those he wanted to promote, he promoted; and those he wanted to humble, he humbled.
27005020 But when his heart became arrogant and hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne and stripped of his glory.
27005021 He was driven away from people and given the mind of an animal; he lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like the ox; and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven, until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and sets over them anyone he wishes.
27005022 “But you, Belshazzar, his son, have not humbled yourself, though you knew all this.
27005023 Instead, you have set yourself up against the Lord of heaven. You had the goblets from his temple brought to you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand. But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand your life and all your ways.
27005024 Therefore he sent the hand that wrote the inscription.
27005025 “This is the inscription that was written: mene, mene, tekel, parsin
27005026 “Here is what these words mean: Mene : God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end.
27005027 Tekel : You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting.
27005028 Peres : Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.”
27005029 Then at Belshazzar’s command, Daniel was clothed in purple, a gold chain was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom.
27005030 That very night Belshazzar, king of the Babylonians, was slain,
27005031 and Darius the Mede took over the kingdom, at the age of sixty-two.
27006001 It pleased Darius to appoint 120 satraps to rule throughout the kingdom,
27006002 with three administrators over them, one of whom was Daniel. The satraps were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer loss.
27006003 Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.
27006004 At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent.
27006005 Finally these men said, “We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God.”
27006006 So these administrators and satraps went as a group to the king and said: “May King Darius live forever!
27006007 The royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers and governors have all agreed that the king should issue an edict and enforce the decree that anyone who prays to any god or human being during the next thirty days, except to you, Your Majesty, shall be thrown into the lions’ den.
27006008 Now, Your Majesty, issue the decree and put it in writing so that it cannot be altered—in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.”
27006009 So King Darius put the decree in writing.
27006010 Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before.
27006011 Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help.
27006012 So they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree: “Did you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or human being except to you, Your Majesty, would be thrown into the lions’ den?” The king answered, “The decree stands—in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.”
27006013 Then they said to the king, “Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, Your Majesty, or to the decree you put in writing. He still prays three times a day.”
27006014 When the king heard this, he was greatly distressed; he was determined to rescue Daniel and made every effort until sundown to save him.
27006015 Then the men went as a group to King Darius and said to him, “Remember, Your Majesty, that according to the law of the Medes and Persians no decree or edict that the king issues can be changed.”
27006016 So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions’ den. The king said to Daniel, “May your God, whom you serve continually, rescue you!”
27006017 A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles, so that Daniel’s situation might not be changed.
27006018 Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night without eating and without any entertainment being brought to him. And he could not sleep.
27006019 At the first light of dawn, the king got up and hurried to the lions’ den.
27006020 When he came near the den, he called to Daniel in an anguished voice, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to rescue you from the lions?”
27006021 Daniel answered, “May the king live forever!
27006022 My God sent his angel, and he shut the mouths of the lions. They have not hurt me, because I was found innocent in his sight. Nor have I ever done any wrong before you, Your Majesty.”
27006023 The king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den. And when Daniel was lifted from the den, no wound was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.
27006024 At the king’s command, the men who had falsely accused Daniel were brought in and thrown into the lions’ den, along with their wives and children. And before they reached the floor of the den, the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.
27006025 Then King Darius wrote to all the nations and peoples of every language in all the earth: “May you prosper greatly!
27006026 “I issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom people must fear and reverence the God of Daniel. “For he is the living God and he endures forever; his kingdom will not be destroyed, his dominion will never end.
27006027 He rescues and he saves; he performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth. He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions.”
27006028 So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
27007001 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying in bed. He wrote down the substance of his dream.
27007002 Daniel said: “In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea.
27007003 Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea.
27007004 “The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a human being, and the mind of a human was given to it.
27007005 “And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, ‘Get up and eat your fill of flesh!’
27007006 “After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule.
27007007 “After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast—terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns.
27007008 “While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a human being and a mouth that spoke boastfully.
27007009 “As I looked, “thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze.
27007010 A river of fire was flowing, coming out from before him. Thousands upon thousands attended him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was seated, and the books were opened.
27007011 “Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire.
27007012 (The other beasts had been stripped of their authority, but were allowed to live for a period of time.)
27007013 “In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence.
27007014 He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all nations and peoples of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.
27007015 “I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me.
27007016 I approached one of those standing there and asked him the meaning of all this. “So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things:
27007017 ‘The four great beasts are four kings that will rise from the earth.
27007018 But the holy people of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever—yes, for ever and ever.’
27007019 “Then I wanted to know the meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws—the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left.
27007020 I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell—the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully.
27007021 As I watched, this horn was waging war against the holy people and defeating them,
27007022 until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the holy people of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom.
27007023 “He gave me this explanation: ‘The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it.
27007024 The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings.
27007025 He will speak against the Most High and oppress his holy people and try to change the set times and the laws. The holy people will be delivered into his hands for a time, times and half a time.
27007026 “ ‘But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever.
27007027 Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be handed over to the holy people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey him.’
27007028 “This is the end of the matter. I, Daniel, was deeply troubled by my thoughts, and my face turned pale, but I kept the matter to myself.”
27008001 In the third year of King Belshazzar’s reign, I, Daniel, had a vision, after the one that had already appeared to me.
27008002 In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal.
27008003 I looked up, and there before me was a ram with two horns, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later.
27008004 I watched the ram as it charged toward the west and the north and the south. No animal could stand against it, and none could rescue from its power. It did as it pleased and became great.
27008005 As I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between its eyes came from the west, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground.
27008006 It came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and charged at it in great rage.
27008007 I saw it attack the ram furiously, striking the ram and shattering its two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against it; the goat knocked it to the ground and trampled on it, and none could rescue the ram from its power.
27008008 The goat became very great, but at the height of its power the large horn was broken off, and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven.
27008009 Out of one of them came another horn, which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the Beautiful Land.
27008010 It grew until it reached the host of the heavens, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them.
27008011 It set itself up to be as great as the commander of the army of the Lord; it took away the daily sacrifice from the Lord, and his sanctuary was thrown down.
27008012 Because of rebellion, the Lord’s people and the daily sacrifice were given over to it. It prospered in everything it did, and truth was thrown to the ground.
27008013 Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to him, “How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled—the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, the surrender of the sanctuary and the trampling underfoot of the Lord’s people?”
27008014 He said to me, “It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated.”
27008015 While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there before me stood one who looked like a man.
27008016 And I heard a man’s voice from the Ulai calling, “Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of the vision.”
27008017 As he came near the place where I was standing, I was terrified and fell prostrate. “Son of man,” he said to me, “understand that the vision concerns the time of the end.”
27008018 While he was speaking to me, I was in a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. Then he touched me and raised me to my feet.
27008019 He said: “I am going to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath, because the vision concerns the appointed time of the end.
27008020 The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia.
27008021 The shaggy goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn between its eyes is the first king.
27008022 The four horns that replaced the one that was broken off represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power.
27008023 “In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a fierce-looking king, a master of intrigue, will arise.
27008024 He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy those who are mighty, the holy people.
27008025 He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power.
27008026 “The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given you is true, but seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future.”
27008027 I, Daniel, was worn out. I lay exhausted for several days. Then I got up and went about the king’s business. I was appalled by the vision; it was beyond understanding.
27009001 In the first year of Darius son of Xerxes (a Mede by descent), who was made ruler over the Babylonian kingdom—
27009002 in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the Scriptures, according to the word of the Lord given to Jeremiah the prophet, that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years.
27009003 So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and petition, in fasting, and in sackcloth and ashes.
27009004 I prayed to the Lord my God and confessed: “Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and keep his commandments,
27009005 we have sinned and done wrong. We have been wicked and have rebelled; we have turned away from your commands and laws.
27009006 We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes and our ancestors, and to all the people of the land.
27009007 “Lord, you are righteous, but this day we are covered with shame—the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, both near and far, in all the countries where you have scattered us because of our unfaithfulness to you.
27009008 We and our kings, our princes and our ancestors are covered with shame, Lord, because we have sinned against you.
27009009 The Lord our God is merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him;
27009010 we have not obeyed the Lord our God or kept the laws he gave us through his servants the prophets.
27009011 All Israel has transgressed your law and turned away, refusing to obey you. “Therefore the curses and sworn judgments written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured out on us, because we have sinned against you.
27009012 You have fulfilled the words spoken against us and against our rulers by bringing on us great disaster. Under the whole heaven nothing has ever been done like what has been done to Jerusalem.
27009013 Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come on us, yet we have not sought the favor of the Lord our God by turning from our sins and giving attention to your truth.
27009014 The Lord did not hesitate to bring the disaster on us, for the Lord our God is righteous in everything he does; yet we have not obeyed him.
27009015 “Now, Lord our God, who brought your people out of Egypt with a mighty hand and who made for yourself a name that endures to this day, we have sinned, we have done wrong.
27009016 Lord, in keeping with all your righteous acts, turn away your anger and your wrath from Jerusalem, your city, your holy hill. Our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors have made Jerusalem and your people an object of scorn to all those around us.
27009017 “Now, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of your servant. For your sake, Lord, look with favor on your desolate sanctuary.
27009018 Give ear, our God, and hear; open your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears your Name. We do not make requests of you because we are righteous, but because of your great mercy.
27009019 Lord, listen! Lord, forgive! Lord, hear and act! For your sake, my God, do not delay, because your city and your people bear your Name.”
27009020 While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and making my request to the Lord my God for his holy hill—
27009021 while I was still in prayer, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision, came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice.
27009022 He instructed me and said to me, “Daniel, I have now come to give you insight and understanding.
27009023 As soon as you began to pray, a word went out, which I have come to tell you, for you are highly esteemed. Therefore, consider the word and understand the vision:
27009024 “Seventy ‘sevens’ are decreed for your people and your holy city to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the Most Holy Place.
27009025 “Know and understand this: From the time the word goes out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, the ruler, comes, there will be seven ‘sevens,’ and sixty-two ‘sevens.’ It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of trouble.
27009026 After the sixty-two ‘sevens,’ the Anointed One will be put to death and will have nothing. The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood: War will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed.
27009027 He will confirm a covenant with many for one ‘seven.’ In the middle of the ‘seven’ he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him. ”
27010001 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a revelation was given to Daniel (who was called Belteshazzar). Its message was true and it concerned a great war. The understanding of the message came to him in a vision.
27010002 At that time I, Daniel, mourned for three weeks.
27010003 I ate no choice food; no meat or wine touched my lips; and I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over.
27010004 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river, the Tigris,
27010005 I looked up and there before me was a man dressed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist.
27010006 His body was like topaz, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude.
27010007 I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision; those who were with me did not see it, but such terror overwhelmed them that they fled and hid themselves.
27010008 So I was left alone, gazing at this great vision; I had no strength left, my face turned deathly pale and I was helpless.
27010009 Then I heard him speaking, and as I listened to him, I fell into a deep sleep, my face to the ground.
27010010 A hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees.
27010011 He said, “Daniel, you who are highly esteemed, consider carefully the words I am about to speak to you, and stand up, for I have now been sent to you.” And when he said this to me, I stood up trembling.
27010012 Then he continued, “Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them.
27010013 But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia.
27010014 Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future, for the vision concerns a time yet to come.”
27010015 While he was saying this to me, I bowed with my face toward the ground and was speechless.
27010016 Then one who looked like a man touched my lips, and I opened my mouth and began to speak. I said to the one standing before me, “I am overcome with anguish because of the vision, my lord, and I feel very weak.
27010017 How can I, your servant, talk with you, my lord? My strength is gone and I can hardly breathe.”
27010018 Again the one who looked like a man touched me and gave me strength.
27010019 “Do not be afraid, you who are highly esteemed,” he said. “Peace! Be strong now; be strong.” When he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, “Speak, my lord, since you have given me strength.”
27010020 So he said, “Do you know why I have come to you? Soon I will return to fight against the prince of Persia, and when I go, the prince of Greece will come;
27010021 but first I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth. (No one supports me against them except Michael, your prince.
27011001 And in the first year of Darius the Mede, I took my stand to support and protect him.)
27011002 “Now then, I tell you the truth: Three more kings will arise in Persia, and then a fourth, who will be far richer than all the others. When he has gained power by his wealth, he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece.
27011003 Then a mighty king will arise, who will rule with great power and do as he pleases.
27011004 After he has arisen, his empire will be broken up and parceled out toward the four winds of heaven. It will not go to his descendants, nor will it have the power he exercised, because his empire will be uprooted and given to others.
27011005 “The king of the South will become strong, but one of his commanders will become even stronger than he and will rule his own kingdom with great power.
27011006 After some years, they will become allies. The daughter of the king of the South will go to the king of the North to make an alliance, but she will not retain her power, and he and his power will not last. In those days she will be betrayed, together with her royal escort and her father and the one who supported her.
27011007 “One from her family line will arise to take her place. He will attack the forces of the king of the North and enter his fortress; he will fight against them and be victorious.
27011008 He will also seize their gods, their metal images and their valuable articles of silver and gold and carry them off to Egypt. For some years he will leave the king of the North alone.
27011009 Then the king of the North will invade the realm of the king of the South but will retreat to his own country.
27011010 His sons will prepare for war and assemble a great army, which will sweep on like an irresistible flood and carry the battle as far as his fortress.
27011011 “Then the king of the South will march out in a rage and fight against the king of the North, who will raise a large army, but it will be defeated.
27011012 When the army is carried off, the king of the South will be filled with pride and will slaughter many thousands, yet he will not remain triumphant.
27011013 For the king of the North will muster another army, larger than the first; and after several years, he will advance with a huge army fully equipped.
27011014 “In those times many will rise against the king of the South. Those who are violent among your own people will rebel in fulfillment of the vision, but without success.
27011015 Then the king of the North will come and build up siege ramps and will capture a fortified city. The forces of the South will be powerless to resist; even their best troops will not have the strength to stand.
27011016 The invader will do as he pleases; no one will be able to stand against him. He will establish himself in the Beautiful Land and will have the power to destroy it.
27011017 He will determine to come with the might of his entire kingdom and will make an alliance with the king of the South. And he will give him a daughter in marriage in order to overthrow the kingdom, but his plans will not succeed or help him.
27011018 Then he will turn his attention to the coastlands and will take many of them, but a commander will put an end to his insolence and will turn his insolence back on him.
27011019 After this, he will turn back toward the fortresses of his own country but will stumble and fall, to be seen no more.
27011020 “His successor will send out a tax collector to maintain the royal splendor. In a few years, however, he will be destroyed, yet not in anger or in battle.
27011021 “He will be succeeded by a contemptible person who has not been given the honor of royalty. He will invade the kingdom when its people feel secure, and he will seize it through intrigue.
27011022 Then an overwhelming army will be swept away before him; both it and a prince of the covenant will be destroyed.
27011023 After coming to an agreement with him, he will act deceitfully, and with only a few people he will rise to power.
27011024 When the richest provinces feel secure, he will invade them and will achieve what neither his fathers nor his forefathers did. He will distribute plunder, loot and wealth among his followers. He will plot the overthrow of fortresses—but only for a time.
27011025 “With a large army he will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South. The king of the South will wage war with a large and very powerful army, but he will not be able to stand because of the plots devised against him.
27011026 Those who eat from the king’s provisions will try to destroy him; his army will be swept away, and many will fall in battle.
27011027 The two kings, with their hearts bent on evil, will sit at the same table and lie to each other, but to no avail, because an end will still come at the appointed time.
27011028 The king of the North will return to his own country with great wealth, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant. He will take action against it and then return to his own country.
27011029 “At the appointed time he will invade the South again, but this time the outcome will be different from what it was before.
27011030 Ships of the western coastlands will oppose him, and he will lose heart. Then he will turn back and vent his fury against the holy covenant. He will return and show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant.
27011031 “His armed forces will rise up to desecrate the temple fortress and will abolish the daily sacrifice. Then they will set up the abomination that causes desolation.
27011032 With flattery he will corrupt those who have violated the covenant, but the people who know their God will firmly resist him.
27011033 “Those who are wise will instruct many, though for a time they will fall by the sword or be burned or captured or plundered.
27011034 When they fall, they will receive a little help, and many who are not sincere will join them.
27011035 Some of the wise will stumble, so that they may be refined, purified and made spotless until the time of the end, for it will still come at the appointed time.
27011036 “The king will do as he pleases. He will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will say unheard-of things against the God of gods. He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed, for what has been determined must take place.
27011037 He will show no regard for the gods of his ancestors or for the one desired by women, nor will he regard any god, but will exalt himself above them all.
27011038 Instead of them, he will honor a god of fortresses; a god unknown to his ancestors he will honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts.
27011039 He will attack the mightiest fortresses with the help of a foreign god and will greatly honor those who acknowledge him. He will make them rulers over many people and will distribute the land at a price.
27011040 “At the time of the end the king of the South will engage him in battle, and the king of the North will storm out against him with chariots and cavalry and a great fleet of ships. He will invade many countries and sweep through them like a flood.
27011041 He will also invade the Beautiful Land. Many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab and the leaders of Ammon will be delivered from his hand.
27011042 He will extend his power over many countries; Egypt will not escape.
27011043 He will gain control of the treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of Egypt, with the Libyans and Cushites in submission.
27011044 But reports from the east and the north will alarm him, and he will set out in a great rage to destroy and annihilate many.
27011045 He will pitch his royal tents between the seas at the beautiful holy mountain. Yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him.
27012001 “At that time Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will arise. There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then. But at that time your people—everyone whose name is found written in the book—will be delivered.
27012002 Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt.
27012003 Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever.
27012004 But you, Daniel, roll up and seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end. Many will go here and there to increase knowledge.”
27012005 Then I, Daniel, looked, and there before me stood two others, one on this bank of the river and one on the opposite bank.
27012006 One of them said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, “How long will it be before these astonishing things are fulfilled?”
27012007 The man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, lifted his right hand and his left hand toward heaven, and I heard him swear by him who lives forever, saying, “It will be for a time, times and half a time. When the power of the holy people has been finally broken, all these things will be completed.”
27012008 I heard, but I did not understand. So I asked, “My lord, what will the outcome of all this be?”
27012009 He replied, “Go your way, Daniel, because the words are rolled up and sealed until the time of the end.
27012010 Many will be purified, made spotless and refined, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. None of the wicked will understand, but those who are wise will understand.
27012011 “From the time that the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days.
27012012 Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the 1,335 days.
27012013 “As for you, go your way till the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance.”
28001001 The word of the Lord that came to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the reign of Jeroboam son of Jehoash king of Israel:
28001002 When the Lord began to speak through Hosea, the Lord said to him, “Go, marry a promiscuous woman and have children with her, for like an adulterous wife this land is guilty of unfaithfulness to the Lord.”
28001003 So he married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.
28001004 Then the Lord said to Hosea, “Call him Jezreel, because I will soon punish the house of Jehu for the massacre at Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel.
28001005 In that day I will break Israel’s bow in the Valley of Jezreel.”
28001006 Gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. Then the Lord said to Hosea, “Call her Lo-Ruhamah (which means “not loved”), for I will no longer show love to Israel, that I should at all forgive them.
28001007 Yet I will show love to Judah; and I will save them—not by bow, sword or battle, or by horses and horsemen, but I, the Lord their God, will save them.”
28001008 After she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, Gomer had another son.
28001009 Then the Lord said, “Call him Lo-Ammi (which means “not my people”), for you are not my people, and I am not your God.
28001010 “Yet the Israelites will be like the sand on the seashore, which cannot be measured or counted. In the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ they will be called ‘children of the living God.’
28001011 The people of Judah and the people of Israel will come together; they will appoint one leader and will come up out of the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel.
28002001 “Say of your brothers, ‘My people,’ and of your sisters, ‘My loved one.’
28002002 “Rebuke your mother, rebuke her, for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband. Let her remove the adulterous look from her face and the unfaithfulness from between her breasts.
28002003 Otherwise I will strip her naked and make her as bare as on the day she was born; I will make her like a desert, turn her into a parched land, and slay her with thirst.
28002004 I will not show my love to her children, because they are the children of adultery.
28002005 Their mother has been unfaithful and has conceived them in disgrace. She said, ‘I will go after my lovers, who give me my food and my water, my wool and my linen, my olive oil and my drink.’
28002006 Therefore I will block her path with thornbushes; I will wall her in so that she cannot find her way.
28002007 She will chase after her lovers but not catch them; she will look for them but not find them. Then she will say, ‘I will go back to my husband as at first, for then I was better off than now.’
28002008 She has not acknowledged that I was the one who gave her the grain, the new wine and oil, who lavished on her the silver and gold— which they used for Baal.
28002009 “Therefore I will take away my grain when it ripens, and my new wine when it is ready. I will take back my wool and my linen, intended to cover her naked body.
28002010 So now I will expose her lewdness before the eyes of her lovers; no one will take her out of my hands.
28002011 I will stop all her celebrations: her yearly festivals, her New Moons, her Sabbath days—all her appointed festivals.
28002012 I will ruin her vines and her fig trees, which she said were her pay from her lovers; I will make them a thicket, and wild animals will devour them.
28002013 I will punish her for the days she burned incense to the Baals; she decked herself with rings and jewelry, and went after her lovers, but me she forgot,” declares the Lord.
28002014 “Therefore I am now going to allure her; I will lead her into the wilderness and speak tenderly to her.
28002015 There I will give her back her vineyards, and will make the Valley of Achor a door of hope. There she will respond as in the days of her youth, as in the day she came up out of Egypt.
28002016 “In that day,” declares the Lord, “you will call me ‘my husband’; you will no longer call me ‘my master. ’
28002017 I will remove the names of the Baals from her lips; no longer will their names be invoked.
28002018 In that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, the birds in the sky and the creatures that move along the ground. Bow and sword and battle I will abolish from the land, so that all may lie down in safety.
28002019 I will betroth you to me forever; I will betroth you in righteousness and justice, in love and compassion.
28002020 I will betroth you in faithfulness, and you will acknowledge the Lord.
28002021 “In that day I will respond,” declares the Lord— “I will respond to the skies, and they will respond to the earth;
28002022 and the earth will respond to the grain, the new wine and the olive oil, and they will respond to Jezreel.
28002023 I will plant her for myself in the land; I will show my love to the one I called ‘Not my loved one. ’ I will say to those called ‘Not my people, ’ ‘You are my people’; and they will say, ‘You are my God.’ ”
28003001 The Lord said to me, “Go, show your love to your wife again, though she is loved by another man and is an adulteress. Love her as the Lord loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes.”
28003002 So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and about a homer and a lethek of barley.
28003003 Then I told her, “You are to live with me many days; you must not be a prostitute or be intimate with any man, and I will behave the same way toward you.”
28003004 For the Israelites will live many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred stones, without ephod or household gods.
28003005 Afterward the Israelites will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king. They will come trembling to the Lord and to his blessings in the last days.
28004001 Hear the word of the Lord, you Israelites, because the Lord has a charge to bring against you who live in the land: “There is no faithfulness, no love, no acknowledgment of God in the land.
28004002 There is only cursing, lying and murder, stealing and adultery; they break all bounds, and bloodshed follows bloodshed.
28004003 Because of this the land dries up, and all who live in it waste away; the beasts of the field, the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea are swept away.
28004004 “But let no one bring a charge, let no one accuse another, for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest.
28004005 You stumble day and night, and the prophets stumble with you. So I will destroy your mother—
28004006 my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge. “Because you have rejected knowledge, I also reject you as my priests; because you have ignored the law of your God, I also will ignore your children.
28004007 The more priests there were, the more they sinned against me; they exchanged their glorious God for something disgraceful.
28004008 They feed on the sins of my people and relish their wickedness.
28004009 And it will be: Like people, like priests. I will punish both of them for their ways and repay them for their deeds.
28004010 “They will eat but not have enough; they will engage in prostitution but not flourish, because they have deserted the Lord to give themselves
28004011 to prostitution; old wine and new wine take away their understanding.
28004012 My people consult a wooden idol, and a diviner’s rod speaks to them. A spirit of prostitution leads them astray; they are unfaithful to their God.
28004013 They sacrifice on the mountaintops and burn offerings on the hills, under oak, poplar and terebinth, where the shade is pleasant. Therefore your daughters turn to prostitution and your daughters-in-law to adultery.
28004014 “I will not punish your daughters when they turn to prostitution, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, because the men themselves consort with harlots and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes— a people without understanding will come to ruin!
28004015 “Though you, Israel, commit adultery, do not let Judah become guilty. “Do not go to Gilgal; do not go up to Beth Aven. And do not swear, ‘As surely as the Lord lives!’
28004016 The Israelites are stubborn, like a stubborn heifer. How then can the Lord pasture them like lambs in a meadow?
28004017 Ephraim is joined to idols; leave him alone!
28004018 Even when their drinks are gone, they continue their prostitution; their rulers dearly love shameful ways.
28004019 A whirlwind will sweep them away, and their sacrifices will bring them shame.
28005001 “Hear this, you priests! Pay attention, you Israelites! Listen, royal house! This judgment is against you: You have been a snare at Mizpah, a net spread out on Tabor.
28005002 The rebels are knee-deep in slaughter. I will discipline all of them.
28005003 I know all about Ephraim; Israel is not hidden from me. Ephraim, you have now turned to prostitution; Israel is corrupt.
28005004 “Their deeds do not permit them to return to their God. A spirit of prostitution is in their heart; they do not acknowledge the Lord.
28005005 Israel’s arrogance testifies against them; the Israelites, even Ephraim, stumble in their sin; Judah also stumbles with them.
28005006 When they go with their flocks and herds to seek the Lord, they will not find him; he has withdrawn himself from them.
28005007 They are unfaithful to the Lord; they give birth to illegitimate children. When they celebrate their New Moon feasts, he will devour their fields.
28005008 “Sound the trumpet in Gibeah, the horn in Ramah. Raise the battle cry in Beth Aven ; lead on, Benjamin.
28005009 Ephraim will be laid waste on the day of reckoning. Among the tribes of Israel I proclaim what is certain.
28005010 Judah’s leaders are like those who move boundary stones. I will pour out my wrath on them like a flood of water.
28005011 Ephraim is oppressed, trampled in judgment, intent on pursuing idols.
28005012 I am like a moth to Ephraim, like rot to the people of Judah.
28005013 “When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his sores, then Ephraim turned to Assyria, and sent to the great king for help. But he is not able to cure you, not able to heal your sores.
28005014 For I will be like a lion to Ephraim, like a great lion to Judah. I will tear them to pieces and go away; I will carry them off, with no one to rescue them.
28005015 Then I will return to my lair until they have borne their guilt and seek my face— in their misery they will earnestly seek me.”
28006001 “Come, let us return to the Lord. He has torn us to pieces but he will heal us; he has injured us but he will bind up our wounds.
28006002 After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will restore us, that we may live in his presence.
28006003 Let us acknowledge the Lord; let us press on to acknowledge him. As surely as the sun rises, he will appear; he will come to us like the winter rains, like the spring rains that water the earth.”
28006004 “What can I do with you, Ephraim? What can I do with you, Judah? Your love is like the morning mist, like the early dew that disappears.
28006005 Therefore I cut you in pieces with my prophets, I killed you with the words of my mouth— then my judgments go forth like the sun.
28006006 For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings.
28006007 As at Adam, they have broken the covenant; they were unfaithful to me there.
28006008 Gilead is a city of evildoers, stained with footprints of blood.
28006009 As marauders lie in ambush for a victim, so do bands of priests; they murder on the road to Shechem, carrying out their wicked schemes.
28006010 I have seen a horrible thing in Israel: There Ephraim is given to prostitution, Israel is defiled.
28006011 “Also for you, Judah, a harvest is appointed. “Whenever I would restore the fortunes of my people,
28007001 whenever I would heal Israel, the sins of Ephraim are exposed and the crimes of Samaria revealed. They practice deceit, thieves break into houses, bandits rob in the streets;
28007002 but they do not realize that I remember all their evil deeds. Their sins engulf them; they are always before me.
28007003 “They delight the king with their wickedness, the princes with their lies.
28007004 They are all adulterers, burning like an oven whose fire the baker need not stir from the kneading of the dough till it rises.
28007005 On the day of the festival of our king the princes become inflamed with wine, and he joins hands with the mockers.
28007006 Their hearts are like an oven; they approach him with intrigue. Their passion smolders all night; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.
28007007 All of them are hot as an oven; they devour their rulers. All their kings fall, and none of them calls on me.
28007008 “Ephraim mixes with the nations; Ephraim is a flat loaf not turned over.
28007009 Foreigners sap his strength, but he does not realize it. His hair is sprinkled with gray, but he does not notice.
28007010 Israel’s arrogance testifies against him, but despite all this he does not return to the Lord his God or search for him.
28007011 “Ephraim is like a dove, easily deceived and senseless— now calling to Egypt, now turning to Assyria.
28007012 When they go, I will throw my net over them; I will pull them down like the birds in the sky. When I hear them flocking together, I will catch them.
28007013 Woe to them, because they have strayed from me! Destruction to them, because they have rebelled against me! I long to redeem them but they speak about me falsely.
28007014 They do not cry out to me from their hearts but wail on their beds. They slash themselves, appealing to their gods for grain and new wine, but they turn away from me.
28007015 I trained them and strengthened their arms, but they plot evil against me.
28007016 They do not turn to the Most High; they are like a faulty bow. Their leaders will fall by the sword because of their insolent words. For this they will be ridiculed in the land of Egypt.
28008001 “Put the trumpet to your lips! An eagle is over the house of the Lord because the people have broken my covenant and rebelled against my law.
28008002 Israel cries out to me, ‘Our God, we acknowledge you!’
28008003 But Israel has rejected what is good; an enemy will pursue him.
28008004 They set up kings without my consent; they choose princes without my approval. With their silver and gold they make idols for themselves to their own destruction.
28008005 Samaria, throw out your calf-idol! My anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of purity?
28008006 They are from Israel! This calf—a metalworker has made it; it is not God. It will be broken in pieces, that calf of Samaria.
28008007 “They sow the wind and reap the whirlwind. The stalk has no head; it will produce no flour. Were it to yield grain, foreigners would swallow it up.
28008008 Israel is swallowed up; now she is among the nations like something no one wants.
28008009 For they have gone up to Assyria like a wild donkey wandering alone. Ephraim has sold herself to lovers.
28008010 Although they have sold themselves among the nations, I will now gather them together. They will begin to waste away under the oppression of the mighty king.
28008011 “Though Ephraim built many altars for sin offerings, these have become altars for sinning.
28008012 I wrote for them the many things of my law, but they regarded them as something foreign.
28008013 Though they offer sacrifices as gifts to me, and though they eat the meat, the Lord is not pleased with them. Now he will remember their wickedness and punish their sins: They will return to Egypt.
28008014 Israel has forgotten their Maker and built palaces; Judah has fortified many towns. But I will send fire on their cities that will consume their fortresses.”
28009001 Do not rejoice, Israel; do not be jubilant like the other nations. For you have been unfaithful to your God; you love the wages of a prostitute at every threshing floor.
28009002 Threshing floors and winepresses will not feed the people; the new wine will fail them.
28009003 They will not remain in the Lord’s land; Ephraim will return to Egypt and eat unclean food in Assyria.
28009004 They will not pour out wine offerings to the Lord, nor will their sacrifices please him. Such sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners; all who eat them will be unclean. This food will be for themselves; it will not come into the temple of the Lord.
28009005 What will you do on the day of your appointed festivals, on the feast days of the Lord?
28009006 Even if they escape from destruction, Egypt will gather them, and Memphis will bury them. Their treasures of silver will be taken over by briers, and thorns will overrun their tents.
28009007 The days of punishment are coming, the days of reckoning are at hand. Let Israel know this. Because your sins are so many and your hostility so great, the prophet is considered a fool, the inspired person a maniac.
28009008 The prophet, along with my God, is the watchman over Ephraim, yet snares await him on all his paths, and hostility in the house of his God.
28009009 They have sunk deep into corruption, as in the days of Gibeah. God will remember their wickedness and punish them for their sins.
28009010 “When I found Israel, it was like finding grapes in the desert; when I saw your ancestors, it was like seeing the early fruit on the fig tree. But when they came to Baal Peor, they consecrated themselves to that shameful idol and became as vile as the thing they loved.
28009011 Ephraim’s glory will fly away like a bird— no birth, no pregnancy, no conception.
28009012 Even if they rear children, I will bereave them of every one. Woe to them when I turn away from them!
28009013 I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place. But Ephraim will bring out their children to the slayer.”
28009014 Give them, Lord— what will you give them? Give them wombs that miscarry and breasts that are dry.
28009015 “Because of all their wickedness in Gilgal, I hated them there. Because of their sinful deeds, I will drive them out of my house. I will no longer love them; all their leaders are rebellious.
28009016 Ephraim is blighted, their root is withered, they yield no fruit. Even if they bear children, I will slay their cherished offspring.”
28009017 My God will reject them because they have not obeyed him; they will be wanderers among the nations.
28010001 Israel was a spreading vine; he brought forth fruit for himself. As his fruit increased, he built more altars; as his land prospered, he adorned his sacred stones.
28010002 Their heart is deceitful, and now they must bear their guilt. The Lord will demolish their altars and destroy their sacred stones.
28010003 Then they will say, “We have no king because we did not revere the Lord. But even if we had a king, what could he do for us?”
28010004 They make many promises, take false oaths and make agreements; therefore lawsuits spring up like poisonous weeds in a plowed field.
28010005 The people who live in Samaria fear for the calf-idol of Beth Aven. Its people will mourn over it, and so will its idolatrous priests, those who had rejoiced over its splendor, because it is taken from them into exile.
28010006 It will be carried to Assyria as tribute for the great king. Ephraim will be disgraced; Israel will be ashamed of its foreign alliances.
28010007 Samaria’s king will be destroyed, swept away like a twig on the surface of the waters.
28010008 The high places of wickedness will be destroyed— it is the sin of Israel. Thorns and thistles will grow up and cover their altars. Then they will say to the mountains, “Cover us!” and to the hills, “Fall on us!”
28010009 “Since the days of Gibeah, you have sinned, Israel, and there you have remained. Will not war again overtake the evildoers in Gibeah?
28010010 When I please, I will punish them; nations will be gathered against them to put them in bonds for their double sin.
28010011 Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh; so I will put a yoke on her fair neck. I will drive Ephraim, Judah must plow, and Jacob must break up the ground.
28010012 Sow righteousness for yourselves, reap the fruit of unfailing love, and break up your unplowed ground; for it is time to seek the Lord, until he comes and showers his righteousness on you.
28010013 But you have planted wickedness, you have reaped evil, you have eaten the fruit of deception. Because you have depended on your own strength and on your many warriors,
28010014 the roar of battle will rise against your people, so that all your fortresses will be devastated— as Shalman devastated Beth Arbel on the day of battle, when mothers were dashed to the ground with their children.
28010015 So will it happen to you, Bethel, because your wickedness is great. When that day dawns, the king of Israel will be completely destroyed.
28011001 “When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.
28011002 But the more they were called, the more they went away from me. They sacrificed to the Baals and they burned incense to images.
28011003 It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the arms; but they did not realize it was I who healed them.
28011004 I led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love. To them I was like one who lifts a little child to the cheek, and I bent down to feed them.
28011005 “Will they not return to Egypt and will not Assyria rule over them because they refuse to repent?
28011006 A sword will flash in their cities; it will devour their false prophets and put an end to their plans.
28011007 My people are determined to turn from me. Even though they call me God Most High, I will by no means exalt them.
28011008 “How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I treat you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboyim? My heart is changed within me; all my compassion is aroused.
28011009 I will not carry out my fierce anger, nor will I devastate Ephraim again. For I am God, and not a man— the Holy One among you. I will not come against their cities.
28011010 They will follow the Lord; he will roar like a lion. When he roars, his children will come trembling from the west.
28011011 They will come from Egypt, trembling like sparrows, from Assyria, fluttering like doves. I will settle them in their homes,” declares the Lord.
28011012 Ephraim has surrounded me with lies, Israel with deceit. And Judah is unruly against God, even against the faithful Holy One.
28012001 Ephraim feeds on the wind; he pursues the east wind all day and multiplies lies and violence. He makes a treaty with Assyria and sends olive oil to Egypt.
28012002 The Lord has a charge to bring against Judah; he will punish Jacob according to his ways and repay him according to his deeds.
28012003 In the womb he grasped his brother’s heel; as a man he struggled with God.
28012004 He struggled with the angel and overcame him; he wept and begged for his favor. He found him at Bethel and talked with him there—
28012005 the Lord God Almighty, the Lord is his name!
28012006 But you must return to your God; maintain love and justice, and wait for your God always.
28012007 The merchant uses dishonest scales and loves to defraud.
28012008 Ephraim boasts, “I am very rich; I have become wealthy. With all my wealth they will not find in me any iniquity or sin.”
28012009 “I have been the Lord your God ever since you came out of Egypt; I will make you live in tents again, as in the days of your appointed festivals.
28012010 I spoke to the prophets, gave them many visions and told parables through them.”
28012011 Is Gilead wicked? Its people are worthless! Do they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal? Their altars will be like piles of stones on a plowed field.
28012012 Jacob fled to the country of Aram ; Israel served to get a wife, and to pay for her he tended sheep.
28012013 The Lord used a prophet to bring Israel up from Egypt, by a prophet he cared for him.
28012014 But Ephraim has aroused his bitter anger; his Lord will leave on him the guilt of his bloodshed and will repay him for his contempt.
28013001 When Ephraim spoke, people trembled; he was exalted in Israel. But he became guilty of Baal worship and died.
28013002 Now they sin more and more; they make idols for themselves from their silver, cleverly fashioned images, all of them the work of craftsmen. It is said of these people, “They offer human sacrifices! They kiss calf-idols!”
28013003 Therefore they will be like the morning mist, like the early dew that disappears, like chaff swirling from a threshing floor, like smoke escaping through a window.
28013004 “But I have been the Lord your God ever since you came out of Egypt. You shall acknowledge no God but me, no Savior except me.
28013005 I cared for you in the wilderness, in the land of burning heat.
28013006 When I fed them, they were satisfied; when they were satisfied, they became proud; then they forgot me.
28013007 So I will be like a lion to them, like a leopard I will lurk by the path.
28013008 Like a bear robbed of her cubs, I will attack them and rip them open; like a lion I will devour them— a wild animal will tear them apart.
28013009 “You are destroyed, Israel, because you are against me, against your helper.
28013010 Where is your king, that he may save you? Where are your rulers in all your towns, of whom you said, ‘Give me a king and princes’?
28013011 So in my anger I gave you a king, and in my wrath I took him away.
28013012 The guilt of Ephraim is stored up, his sins are kept on record.
28013013 Pains as of a woman in childbirth come to him, but he is a child without wisdom; when the time arrives, he doesn’t have the sense to come out of the womb.
28013014 “I will deliver this people from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death. Where, O death, are your plagues? Where, O grave, is your destruction? “I will have no compassion,
28013015 even though he thrives among his brothers. An east wind from the Lord will come, blowing in from the desert; his spring will fail and his well dry up. His storehouse will be plundered of all its treasures.
28013016 The people of Samaria must bear their guilt, because they have rebelled against their God. They will fall by the sword; their little ones will be dashed to the ground, their pregnant women ripped open.”
28014001 Return, Israel, to the Lord your God. Your sins have been your downfall!
28014002 Take words with you and return to the Lord. Say to him: “Forgive all our sins and receive us graciously, that we may offer the fruit of our lips.
28014003 Assyria cannot save us; we will not mount warhorses. We will never again say ‘Our gods’ to what our own hands have made, for in you the fatherless find compassion.”
28014004 “I will heal their waywardness and love them freely, for my anger has turned away from them.
28014005 I will be like the dew to Israel; he will blossom like a lily. Like a cedar of Lebanon he will send down his roots;
28014006 his young shoots will grow. His splendor will be like an olive tree, his fragrance like a cedar of Lebanon.
28014007 People will dwell again in his shade; they will flourish like the grain, they will blossom like the vine— Israel’s fame will be like the wine of Lebanon.
28014008 Ephraim, what more have I to do with idols? I will answer him and care for him. I am like a flourishing juniper; your fruitfulness comes from me.”
28014009 Who is wise? Let them realize these things. Who is discerning? Let them understand. The ways of the Lord are right; the righteous walk in them, but the rebellious stumble in them.
29001001 The word of the Lord that came to Joel son of Pethuel.
29001002 Hear this, you elders; listen, all who live in the land. Has anything like this ever happened in your days or in the days of your ancestors?
29001003 Tell it to your children, and let your children tell it to their children, and their children to the next generation.
29001004 What the locust swarm has left the great locusts have eaten; what the great locusts have left the young locusts have eaten; what the young locusts have left other locusts have eaten.
29001005 Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! Wail, all you drinkers of wine; wail because of the new wine, for it has been snatched from your lips.
29001006 A nation has invaded my land, a mighty army without number; it has the teeth of a lion, the fangs of a lioness.
29001007 It has laid waste my vines and ruined my fig trees. It has stripped off their bark and thrown it away, leaving their branches white.
29001008 Mourn like a virgin in sackcloth grieving for the betrothed of her youth.
29001009 Grain offerings and drink offerings are cut off from the house of the Lord. The priests are in mourning, those who minister before the Lord.
29001010 The fields are ruined, the ground is dried up; the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, the olive oil fails.
29001011 Despair, you farmers, wail, you vine growers; grieve for the wheat and the barley, because the harvest of the field is destroyed.
29001012 The vine is dried up and the fig tree is withered; the pomegranate, the palm and the apple tree— all the trees of the field—are dried up. Surely the people’s joy is withered away.
29001013 Put on sackcloth, you priests, and mourn; wail, you who minister before the altar. Come, spend the night in sackcloth, you who minister before my God; for the grain offerings and drink offerings are withheld from the house of your God.
29001014 Declare a holy fast; call a sacred assembly. Summon the elders and all who live in the land to the house of the Lord your God, and cry out to the Lord.
29001015 Alas for that day! For the day of the Lord is near; it will come like destruction from the Almighty.
29001016 Has not the food been cut off before our very eyes— joy and gladness from the house of our God?
29001017 The seeds are shriveled beneath the clods. The storehouses are in ruins, the granaries have been broken down, for the grain has dried up.
29001018 How the cattle moan! The herds mill about because they have no pasture; even the flocks of sheep are suffering.
29001019 To you, Lord, I call, for fire has devoured the pastures in the wilderness and flames have burned up all the trees of the field.
29001020 Even the wild animals pant for you; the streams of water have dried up and fire has devoured the pastures in the wilderness.
29002001 Blow the trumpet in Zion; sound the alarm on my holy hill. Let all who live in the land tremble, for the day of the Lord is coming. It is close at hand—
29002002 a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness. Like dawn spreading across the mountains a large and mighty army comes, such as never was in ancient times nor ever will be in ages to come.
29002003 Before them fire devours, behind them a flame blazes. Before them the land is like the garden of Eden, behind them, a desert waste— nothing escapes them.
29002004 They have the appearance of horses; they gallop along like cavalry.
29002005 With a noise like that of chariots they leap over the mountaintops, like a crackling fire consuming stubble, like a mighty army drawn up for battle.
29002006 At the sight of them, nations are in anguish; every face turns pale.
29002007 They charge like warriors; they scale walls like soldiers. They all march in line, not swerving from their course.
29002008 They do not jostle each other; each marches straight ahead. They plunge through defenses without breaking ranks.
29002009 They rush upon the city; they run along the wall. They climb into the houses; like thieves they enter through the windows.
29002010 Before them the earth shakes, the heavens tremble, the sun and moon are darkened, and the stars no longer shine.
29002011 The Lord thunders at the head of his army; his forces are beyond number, and mighty is the army that obeys his command. The day of the Lord is great; it is dreadful. Who can endure it?
29002012 “Even now,” declares the Lord, “return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning.”
29002013 Rend your heart and not your garments. Return to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, and he relents from sending calamity.
29002014 Who knows? He may turn and relent and leave behind a blessing— grain offerings and drink offerings for the Lord your God.
29002015 Blow the trumpet in Zion, declare a holy fast, call a sacred assembly.
29002016 Gather the people, consecrate the assembly; bring together the elders, gather the children, those nursing at the breast. Let the bridegroom leave his room and the bride her chamber.
29002017 Let the priests, who minister before the Lord, weep between the portico and the altar. Let them say, “Spare your people, Lord. Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn, a byword among the nations. Why should they say among the peoples, ‘Where is their God?’ ”
29002018 Then the Lord was jealous for his land and took pity on his people.
29002019 The Lord replied to them: “I am sending you grain, new wine and olive oil, enough to satisfy you fully; never again will I make you an object of scorn to the nations.
29002020 “I will drive the northern horde far from you, pushing it into a parched and barren land; its eastern ranks will drown in the Dead Sea and its western ranks in the Mediterranean Sea. And its stench will go up; its smell will rise.” Surely he has done great things!
29002021 Do not be afraid, land of Judah; be glad and rejoice. Surely the Lord has done great things!
29002022 Do not be afraid, you wild animals, for the pastures in the wilderness are becoming green. The trees are bearing their fruit; the fig tree and the vine yield their riches.
29002023 Be glad, people of Zion, rejoice in the Lord your God, for he has given you the autumn rains because he is faithful. He sends you abundant showers, both autumn and spring rains, as before.
29002024 The threshing floors will be filled with grain; the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.
29002025 “I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten— the great locust and the young locust, the other locusts and the locust swarm — my great army that I sent among you.
29002026 You will have plenty to eat, until you are full, and you will praise the name of the Lord your God, who has worked wonders for you; never again will my people be shamed.
29002027 Then you will know that I am in Israel, that I am the Lord your God, and that there is no other; never again will my people be shamed.
29002028 “And afterward, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions.
29002029 Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days.
29002030 I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and billows of smoke.
29002031 The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.
29002032 And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved; for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be deliverance, as the Lord has said, even among the survivors whom the Lord calls.
29003001 “In those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
29003002 I will gather all nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. There I will put them on trial for what they did to my inheritance, my people Israel, because they scattered my people among the nations and divided up my land.
29003003 They cast lots for my people and traded boys for prostitutes; they sold girls for wine to drink.
29003004 “Now what have you against me, Tyre and Sidon and all you regions of Philistia? Are you repaying me for something I have done? If you are paying me back, I will swiftly and speedily return on your own heads what you have done.
29003005 For you took my silver and my gold and carried off my finest treasures to your temples.
29003006 You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, that you might send them far from their homeland.
29003007 “See, I am going to rouse them out of the places to which you sold them, and I will return on your own heads what you have done.
29003008 I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far away.” The Lord has spoken.
29003009 Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare for war! Rouse the warriors! Let all the fighting men draw near and attack.
29003010 Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears. Let the weakling say, “I am strong!”
29003011 Come quickly, all you nations from every side, and assemble there. Bring down your warriors, Lord!
29003012 “Let the nations be roused; let them advance into the Valley of Jehoshaphat, for there I will sit to judge all the nations on every side.
29003013 Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, trample the grapes, for the winepress is full and the vats overflow— so great is their wickedness!”
29003014 Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.
29003015 The sun and moon will be darkened, and the stars no longer shine.
29003016 The Lord will roar from Zion and thunder from Jerusalem; the earth and the heavens will tremble. But the Lord will be a refuge for his people, a stronghold for the people of Israel.
29003017 “Then you will know that I, the Lord your God, dwell in Zion, my holy hill. Jerusalem will be holy; never again will foreigners invade her.
29003018 “In that day the mountains will drip new wine, and the hills will flow with milk; all the ravines of Judah will run with water. A fountain will flow out of the Lord’s house and will water the valley of acacias.
29003019 But Egypt will be desolate, Edom a desert waste, because of violence done to the people of Judah, in whose land they shed innocent blood.
29003020 Judah will be inhabited forever and Jerusalem through all generations.
29003021 Shall I leave their innocent blood unavenged? No, I will not.” The Lord dwells in Zion!
30001001 The words of Amos, one of the shepherds of Tekoa—the vision he saw concerning Israel two years before the earthquake, when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel.
30001002 He said: “The Lord roars from Zion and thunders from Jerusalem; the pastures of the shepherds dry up, and the top of Carmel withers.”
30001003 This is what the Lord says: “For three sins of Damascus, even for four, I will not relent. Because she threshed Gilead with sledges having iron teeth,
30001004 I will send fire on the house of Hazael that will consume the fortresses of Ben-Hadad.
30001005 I will break down the gate of Damascus; I will destroy the king who is in the Valley of Aven and the one who holds the scepter in Beth Eden. The people of Aram will go into exile to Kir,” says the Lord.
30001006 This is what the Lord says: “For three sins of Gaza, even for four, I will not relent. Because she took captive whole communities and sold them to Edom,
30001007 I will send fire on the walls of Gaza that will consume her fortresses.
30001008 I will destroy the king of Ashdod and the one who holds the scepter in Ashkelon. I will turn my hand against Ekron, till the last of the Philistines are dead,” says the Sovereign Lord.
30001009 This is what the Lord says: “For three sins of Tyre, even for four, I will not relent. Because she sold whole communities of captives to Edom, disregarding a treaty of brotherhood,
30001010 I will send fire on the walls of Tyre that will consume her fortresses.”
30001011 This is what the Lord says: “For three sins of Edom, even for four, I will not relent. Because he pursued his brother with a sword and slaughtered the women of the land, because his anger raged continually and his fury flamed unchecked,
30001012 I will send fire on Teman that will consume the fortresses of Bozrah.”
30001013 This is what the Lord says: “For three sins of Ammon, even for four, I will not relent. Because he ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead in order to extend his borders,
30001014 I will set fire to the walls of Rabbah that will consume her fortresses amid war cries on the day of battle, amid violent winds on a stormy day.
30001015 Her king will go into exile, he and his officials together,” says the Lord.
30002001 This is what the Lord says: “For three sins of Moab, even for four, I will not relent. Because he burned to ashes the bones of Edom’s king,
30002002 I will send fire on Moab that will consume the fortresses of Kerioth. Moab will go down in great tumult amid war cries and the blast of the trumpet.
30002003 I will destroy her ruler and kill all her officials with him,” says the Lord.
30002004 This is what the Lord says: “For three sins of Judah, even for four, I will not relent. Because they have rejected the law of the Lord and have not kept his decrees, because they have been led astray by false gods, the gods their ancestors followed,
30002005 I will send fire on Judah that will consume the fortresses of Jerusalem.”
30002006 This is what the Lord says: “For three sins of Israel, even for four, I will not relent. They sell the innocent for silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals.
30002007 They trample on the heads of the poor as on the dust of the ground and deny justice to the oppressed. Father and son use the same girl and so profane my holy name.
30002008 They lie down beside every altar on garments taken in pledge. In the house of their god they drink wine taken as fines.
30002009 “Yet I destroyed the Amorites before them, though they were tall as the cedars and strong as the oaks. I destroyed their fruit above and their roots below.
30002010 I brought you up out of Egypt and led you forty years in the wilderness to give you the land of the Amorites.
30002011 “I also raised up prophets from among your children and Nazirites from among your youths. Is this not true, people of Israel?” declares the Lord.
30002012 “But you made the Nazirites drink wine and commanded the prophets not to prophesy.
30002013 “Now then, I will crush you as a cart crushes when loaded with grain.
30002014 The swift will not escape, the strong will not muster their strength, and the warrior will not save his life.
30002015 The archer will not stand his ground, the fleet-footed soldier will not get away, and the horseman will not save his life.
30002016 Even the bravest warriors will flee naked on that day,” declares the Lord.
30003001 Hear this word, people of Israel, the word the Lord has spoken against you—against the whole family I brought up out of Egypt:
30003002 “You only have I chosen of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your sins.”
30003003 Do two walk together unless they have agreed to do so?
30003004 Does a lion roar in the thicket when it has no prey? Does it growl in its den when it has caught nothing?
30003005 Does a bird swoop down to a trap on the ground when no bait is there? Does a trap spring up from the ground if it has not caught anything?
30003006 When a trumpet sounds in a city, do not the people tremble? When disaster comes to a city, has not the Lord caused it?
30003007 Surely the Sovereign Lord does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.
30003008 The lion has roared— who will not fear? The Sovereign Lord has spoken— who can but prophesy?
30003009 Proclaim to the fortresses of Ashdod and to the fortresses of Egypt: “Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria; see the great unrest within her and the oppression among her people.”
30003010 “They do not know how to do right,” declares the Lord, “who store up in their fortresses what they have plundered and looted.”
30003011 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: “An enemy will overrun your land, pull down your strongholds and plunder your fortresses.”
30003012 This is what the Lord says: “As a shepherd rescues from the lion’s mouth only two leg bones or a piece of an ear, so will the Israelites living in Samaria be rescued, with only the head of a bed and a piece of fabric from a couch. ”
30003013 “Hear this and testify against the descendants of Jacob,” declares the Lord, the Lord God Almighty.
30003014 “On the day I punish Israel for her sins, I will destroy the altars of Bethel; the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground.
30003015 I will tear down the winter house along with the summer house; the houses adorned with ivory will be destroyed and the mansions will be demolished,” declares the Lord.
30004001 Hear this word, you cows of Bashan on Mount Samaria, you women who oppress the poor and crush the needy and say to your husbands, “Bring us some drinks!”
30004002 The Sovereign Lord has sworn by his holiness: “The time will surely come when you will be taken away with hooks, the last of you with fishhooks.
30004003 You will each go straight out through breaches in the wall, and you will be cast out toward Harmon, ” declares the Lord.
30004004 “Go to Bethel and sin; go to Gilgal and sin yet more. Bring your sacrifices every morning, your tithes every three years.
30004005 Burn leavened bread as a thank offering and brag about your freewill offerings— boast about them, you Israelites, for this is what you love to do,” declares the Sovereign Lord.
30004006 “I gave you empty stomachs in every city and lack of bread in every town, yet you have not returned to me,” declares the Lord.
30004007 “I also withheld rain from you when the harvest was still three months away. I sent rain on one town, but withheld it from another. One field had rain; another had none and dried up.
30004008 People staggered from town to town for water but did not get enough to drink, yet you have not returned to me,” declares the Lord.
30004009 “Many times I struck your gardens and vineyards, destroying them with blight and mildew. Locusts devoured your fig and olive trees, yet you have not returned to me,” declares the Lord.
30004010 “I sent plagues among you as I did to Egypt. I killed your young men with the sword, along with your captured horses. I filled your nostrils with the stench of your camps, yet you have not returned to me,” declares the Lord.
30004011 “I overthrew some of you as I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. You were like a burning stick snatched from the fire, yet you have not returned to me,” declares the Lord.
30004012 “Therefore this is what I will do to you, Israel, and because I will do this to you, Israel, prepare to meet your God.”
30004013 He who forms the mountains, who creates the wind, and who reveals his thoughts to mankind, who turns dawn to darkness, and treads on the heights of the earth— the Lord God Almighty is his name.
30005001 Hear this word, Israel, this lament I take up concerning you:
30005002 “Fallen is Virgin Israel, never to rise again, deserted in her own land, with no one to lift her up.”
30005003 This is what the Sovereign Lord says to Israel: “Your city that marches out a thousand strong will have only a hundred left; your town that marches out a hundred strong will have only ten left.”
30005004 This is what the Lord says to Israel: “Seek me and live;
30005005 do not seek Bethel, do not go to Gilgal, do not journey to Beersheba. For Gilgal will surely go into exile, and Bethel will be reduced to nothing. ”
30005006 Seek the Lord and live, or he will sweep through the tribes of Joseph like a fire; it will devour them, and Bethel will have no one to quench it.
30005007 There are those who turn justice into bitterness and cast righteousness to the ground.
30005008 He who made the Pleiades and Orion, who turns midnight into dawn and darkens day into night, who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the land— the Lord is his name.
30005009 With a blinding flash he destroys the stronghold and brings the fortified city to ruin.
30005010 There are those who hate the one who upholds justice in court and detest the one who tells the truth.
30005011 You levy a straw tax on the poor and impose a tax on their grain. Therefore, though you have built stone mansions, you will not live in them; though you have planted lush vineyards, you will not drink their wine.
30005012 For I know how many are your offenses and how great your sins. There are those who oppress the innocent and take bribes and deprive the poor of justice in the courts.
30005013 Therefore the prudent keep quiet in such times, for the times are evil.
30005014 Seek good, not evil, that you may live. Then the Lord God Almighty will be with you, just as you say he is.
30005015 Hate evil, love good; maintain justice in the courts. Perhaps the Lord God Almighty will have mercy on the remnant of Joseph.
30005016 Therefore this is what the Lord, the Lord God Almighty, says: “There will be wailing in all the streets and cries of anguish in every public square. The farmers will be summoned to weep and the mourners to wail.
30005017 There will be wailing in all the vineyards, for I will pass through your midst,” says the Lord.
30005018 Woe to you who long for the day of the Lord! Why do you long for the day of the Lord? That day will be darkness, not light.
30005019 It will be as though a man fled from a lion only to meet a bear, as though he entered his house and rested his hand on the wall only to have a snake bite him.
30005020 Will not the day of the Lord be darkness, not light— pitch-dark, without a ray of brightness?
30005021 “I hate, I despise your religious festivals; your assemblies are a stench to me.
30005022 Even though you bring me burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them. Though you bring choice fellowship offerings, I will have no regard for them.
30005023 Away with the noise of your songs! I will not listen to the music of your harps.
30005024 But let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream!
30005025 “Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the wilderness, people of Israel?
30005026 You have lifted up the shrine of your king, the pedestal of your idols, the star of your god — which you made for yourselves.
30005027 Therefore I will send you into exile beyond Damascus,” says the Lord, whose name is God Almighty.
30006001 Woe to you who are complacent in Zion, and to you who feel secure on Mount Samaria, you notable men of the foremost nation, to whom the people of Israel come!
30006002 Go to Kalneh and look at it; go from there to great Hamath, and then go down to Gath in Philistia. Are they better off than your two kingdoms? Is their land larger than yours?
30006003 You put off the day of disaster and bring near a reign of terror.
30006004 You lie on beds adorned with ivory and lounge on your couches. You dine on choice lambs and fattened calves.
30006005 You strum away on your harps like David and improvise on musical instruments.
30006006 You drink wine by the bowlful and use the finest lotions, but you do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph.
30006007 Therefore you will be among the first to go into exile; your feasting and lounging will end.
30006008 The Sovereign Lord has sworn by himself—the Lord God Almighty declares: “I abhor the pride of Jacob and detest his fortresses; I will deliver up the city and everything in it.”
30006009 If ten people are left in one house, they too will die.
30006010 And if the relative who comes to carry the bodies out of the house to burn them asks anyone who might be hiding there, “Is anyone else with you?” and he says, “No,” then he will go on to say, “Hush! We must not mention the name of the Lord.”
30006011 For the Lord has given the command, and he will smash the great house into pieces and the small house into bits.
30006012 Do horses run on the rocky crags? Does one plow the sea with oxen? But you have turned justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness—
30006013 you who rejoice in the conquest of Lo Debar and say, “Did we not take Karnaim by our own strength?”
30006014 For the Lord God Almighty declares, “I will stir up a nation against you, Israel, that will oppress you all the way from Lebo Hamath to the valley of the Arabah.”
30007001 This is what the Sovereign Lord showed me: He was preparing swarms of locusts after the king’s share had been harvested and just as the late crops were coming up.
30007002 When they had stripped the land clean, I cried out, “Sovereign Lord, forgive! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!”
30007003 So the Lord relented. “This will not happen,” the Lord said.
30007004 This is what the Sovereign Lord showed me: The Sovereign Lord was calling for judgment by fire; it dried up the great deep and devoured the land.
30007005 Then I cried out, “Sovereign Lord, I beg you, stop! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!”
30007006 So the Lord relented. “This will not happen either,” the Sovereign Lord said.
30007007 This is what he showed me: The Lord was standing by a wall that had been built true to plumb, with a plumb line in his hand.
30007008 And the Lord asked me, “What do you see, Amos?” “A plumb line,” I replied. Then the Lord said, “Look, I am setting a plumb line among my people Israel; I will spare them no longer.
30007009 “The high places of Isaac will be destroyed and the sanctuaries of Israel will be ruined; with my sword I will rise against the house of Jeroboam.”
30007010 Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel: “Amos is raising a conspiracy against you in the very heart of Israel. The land cannot bear all his words.
30007011 For this is what Amos is saying: “ ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will surely go into exile, away from their native land.’ ”
30007012 Then Amaziah said to Amos, “Get out, you seer! Go back to the land of Judah. Earn your bread there and do your prophesying there.
30007013 Don’t prophesy anymore at Bethel, because this is the king’s sanctuary and the temple of the kingdom.”
30007014 Amos answered Amaziah, “I was neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet, but I was a shepherd, and I also took care of sycamore-fig trees.
30007015 But the Lord took me from tending the flock and said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’
30007016 Now then, hear the word of the Lord. You say, “ ‘Do not prophesy against Israel, and stop preaching against the descendants of Isaac.’
30007017 “Therefore this is what the Lord says: “ ‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword. Your land will be measured and divided up, and you yourself will die in a pagan country. And Israel will surely go into exile, away from their native land.’ ”
30008001 This is what the Sovereign Lord showed me: a basket of ripe fruit.
30008002 “What do you see, Amos?” he asked. “A basket of ripe fruit,” I answered. Then the Lord said to me, “The time is ripe for my people Israel; I will spare them no longer.
30008003 “In that day,” declares the Sovereign Lord, “the songs in the temple will turn to wailing. Many, many bodies—flung everywhere! Silence!”
30008004 Hear this, you who trample the needy and do away with the poor of the land,
30008005 saying, “When will the New Moon be over that we may sell grain, and the Sabbath be ended that we may market wheat?”— skimping on the measure, boosting the price and cheating with dishonest scales,
30008006 buying the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, selling even the sweepings with the wheat.
30008007 The Lord has sworn by himself, the Pride of Jacob: “I will never forget anything they have done.
30008008 “Will not the land tremble for this, and all who live in it mourn? The whole land will rise like the Nile; it will be stirred up and then sink like the river of Egypt.
30008009 “In that day,” declares the Sovereign Lord, “I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight.
30008010 I will turn your religious festivals into mourning and all your singing into weeping. I will make all of you wear sackcloth and shave your heads. I will make that time like mourning for an only son and the end of it like a bitter day.
30008011 “The days are coming,” declares the Sovereign Lord, “when I will send a famine through the land— not a famine of food or a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the words of the Lord.
30008012 People will stagger from sea to sea and wander from north to east, searching for the word of the Lord, but they will not find it.
30008013 “In that day “the lovely young women and strong young men will faint because of thirst.
30008014 Those who swear by the sin of Samaria— who say, ‘As surely as your god lives, Dan,’ or, ‘As surely as the god of Beersheba lives’— they will fall, never to rise again.”
30009001 I saw the Lord standing by the altar, and he said: “Strike the tops of the pillars so that the thresholds shake. Bring them down on the heads of all the people; those who are left I will kill with the sword. Not one will get away, none will escape.
30009002 Though they dig down to the depths below, from there my hand will take them. Though they climb up to the heavens above, from there I will bring them down.
30009003 Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, there I will hunt them down and seize them. Though they hide from my eyes at the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent to bite them.
30009004 Though they are driven into exile by their enemies, there I will command the sword to slay them. “I will keep my eye on them for harm and not for good.”
30009005 The Lord, the Lord Almighty— he touches the earth and it melts, and all who live in it mourn; the whole land rises like the Nile, then sinks like the river of Egypt;
30009006 he builds his lofty palace in the heavens and sets its foundation on the earth; he calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the land— the Lord is his name.
30009007 “Are not you Israelites the same to me as the Cushites ?” declares the Lord. “Did I not bring Israel up from Egypt, the Philistines from Caphtor and the Arameans from Kir?
30009008 “Surely the eyes of the Sovereign Lord are on the sinful kingdom. I will destroy it from the face of the earth. Yet I will not totally destroy the descendants of Jacob,” declares the Lord.
30009009 “For I will give the command, and I will shake the people of Israel among all the nations as grain is shaken in a sieve, and not a pebble will reach the ground.
30009010 All the sinners among my people will die by the sword, all those who say, ‘Disaster will not overtake or meet us.’
30009011 “In that day I will restore David’s fallen shelter— I will repair its broken walls and restore its ruins— and will rebuild it as it used to be,
30009012 so that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations that bear my name, ” declares the Lord, who will do these things.
30009013 “The days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when the reaper will be overtaken by the plowman and the planter by the one treading grapes. New wine will drip from the mountains and flow from all the hills,
30009014 and I will bring my people Israel back from exile. “They will rebuild the ruined cities and live in them. They will plant vineyards and drink their wine; they will make gardens and eat their fruit.
30009015 I will plant Israel in their own land, never again to be uprooted from the land I have given them,” says the Lord your God.
31001001 The vision of Obadiah. This is what the Sovereign Lord says about Edom— We have heard a message from the Lord: An envoy was sent to the nations to say, “Rise, let us go against her for battle”—
31001002 “See, I will make you small among the nations; you will be utterly despised.
31001003 The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rocks and make your home on the heights, you who say to yourself, ‘Who can bring me down to the ground?’
31001004 Though you soar like the eagle and make your nest among the stars, from there I will bring you down,” declares the Lord.
31001005 “If thieves came to you, if robbers in the night— oh, what a disaster awaits you!— would they not steal only as much as they wanted? If grape pickers came to you, would they not leave a few grapes?
31001006 But how Esau will be ransacked, his hidden treasures pillaged!
31001007 All your allies will force you to the border; your friends will deceive and overpower you; those who eat your bread will set a trap for you, but you will not detect it.
31001008 “In that day,” declares the Lord, “will I not destroy the wise men of Edom, those of understanding in the mountains of Esau?
31001009 Your warriors, Teman, will be terrified, and everyone in Esau’s mountains will be cut down in the slaughter.
31001010 Because of the violence against your brother Jacob, you will be covered with shame; you will be destroyed forever.
31001011 On the day you stood aloof while strangers carried off his wealth and foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of them.
31001012 You should not gloat over your brother in the day of his misfortune, nor rejoice over the people of Judah in the day of their destruction, nor boast so much in the day of their trouble.
31001013 You should not march through the gates of my people in the day of their disaster, nor gloat over them in their calamity in the day of their disaster, nor seize their wealth in the day of their disaster.
31001014 You should not wait at the crossroads to cut down their fugitives, nor hand over their survivors in the day of their trouble.
31001015 “The day of the Lord is near for all nations. As you have done, it will be done to you; your deeds will return upon your own head.
31001016 Just as you drank on my holy hill, so all the nations will drink continually; they will drink and drink and be as if they had never been.
31001017 But on Mount Zion will be deliverance; it will be holy, and Jacob will possess his inheritance.
31001018 Jacob will be a fire and Joseph a flame; Esau will be stubble, and they will set him on fire and destroy him. There will be no survivors from Esau.” The Lord has spoken.
31001019 People from the Negev will occupy the mountains of Esau, and people from the foothills will possess the land of the Philistines. They will occupy the fields of Ephraim and Samaria, and Benjamin will possess Gilead.
31001020 This company of Israelite exiles who are in Canaan will possess the land as far as Zarephath; the exiles from Jerusalem who are in Sepharad will possess the towns of the Negev.
31001021 Deliverers will go up on Mount Zion to govern the mountains of Esau. And the kingdom will be the Lord’s.
32001001 The word of the Lord came to Jonah son of Amittai:
32001002 “Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before me.”
32001003 But Jonah ran away from the Lord and headed for Tarshish. He went down to Joppa, where he found a ship bound for that port. After paying the fare, he went aboard and sailed for Tarshish to flee from the Lord.
32001004 Then the Lord sent a great wind on the sea, and such a violent storm arose that the ship threatened to break up.
32001005 All the sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own god. And they threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship. But Jonah had gone below deck, where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep.
32001006 The captain went to him and said, “How can you sleep? Get up and call on your god! Maybe he will take notice of us so that we will not perish.”
32001007 Then the sailors said to each other, “Come, let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity.” They cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah.
32001008 So they asked him, “Tell us, who is responsible for making all this trouble for us? What kind of work do you do? Where do you come from? What is your country? From what people are you?”
32001009 He answered, “I am a Hebrew and I worship the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.”
32001010 This terrified them and they asked, “What have you done?” (They knew he was running away from the Lord, because he had already told them so.)
32001011 The sea was getting rougher and rougher. So they asked him, “What should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?”
32001012 “Pick me up and throw me into the sea,” he replied, “and it will become calm. I know that it is my fault that this great storm has come upon you.”
32001013 Instead, the men did their best to row back to land. But they could not, for the sea grew even wilder than before.
32001014 Then they cried out to the Lord, “Please, Lord, do not let us die for taking this man’s life. Do not hold us accountable for killing an innocent man, for you, Lord, have done as you pleased.”
32001015 Then they took Jonah and threw him overboard, and the raging sea grew calm.
32001016 At this the men greatly feared the Lord, and they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows to him.
32001017 Now the Lord provided a huge fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
32002001 From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the Lord his God.
32002002 He said: “In my distress I called to the Lord, and he answered me. From deep in the realm of the dead I called for help, and you listened to my cry.
32002003 You hurled me into the depths, into the very heart of the seas, and the currents swirled about me; all your waves and breakers swept over me.
32002004 I said, ‘I have been banished from your sight; yet I will look again toward your holy temple.’
32002005 The engulfing waters threatened me, the deep surrounded me; seaweed was wrapped around my head.
32002006 To the roots of the mountains I sank down; the earth beneath barred me in forever. But you, Lord my God, brought my life up from the pit.
32002007 “When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, Lord, and my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple.
32002008 “Those who cling to worthless idols turn away from God’s love for them.
32002009 But I, with shouts of grateful praise, will sacrifice to you. What I have vowed I will make good. I will say, ‘Salvation comes from the Lord.’ ”
32002010 And the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
32003001 Then the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time:
32003002 “Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you.”
32003003 Jonah obeyed the word of the Lord and went to Nineveh. Now Nineveh was a very large city; it took three days to go through it.
32003004 Jonah began by going a day’s journey into the city, proclaiming, “Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown.”
32003005 The Ninevites believed God. A fast was proclaimed, and all of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth.
32003006 When Jonah’s warning reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust.
32003007 This is the proclamation he issued in Nineveh: “By the decree of the king and his nobles: Do not let people or animals, herds or flocks, taste anything; do not let them eat or drink.
32003008 But let people and animals be covered with sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil ways and their violence.
32003009 Who knows? God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish.”
32003010 When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he relented and did not bring on them the destruction he had threatened.
32004001 But to Jonah this seemed very wrong, and he became angry.
32004002 He prayed to the Lord, “Isn’t this what I said, Lord, when I was still at home? That is what I tried to forestall by fleeing to Tarshish. I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love, a God who relents from sending calamity.
32004003 Now, Lord, take away my life, for it is better for me to die than to live.”
32004004 But the Lord replied, “Is it right for you to be angry?”
32004005 Jonah had gone out and sat down at a place east of the city. There he made himself a shelter, sat in its shade and waited to see what would happen to the city.
32004006 Then the Lord God provided a leafy plant and made it grow up over Jonah to give shade for his head to ease his discomfort, and Jonah was very happy about the plant.
32004007 But at dawn the next day God provided a worm, which chewed the plant so that it withered.
32004008 When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind, and the sun blazed on Jonah’s head so that he grew faint. He wanted to die, and said, “It would be better for me to die than to live.”
32004009 But God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?” “It is,” he said. “And I’m so angry I wish I were dead.”
32004010 But the Lord said, “You have been concerned about this plant, though you did not tend it or make it grow. It sprang up overnight and died overnight.
32004011 And should I not have concern for the great city of Nineveh, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left—and also many animals?”
33001001 The word of the Lord that came to Micah of Moresheth during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah—the vision he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
33001002 Hear, you peoples, all of you, listen, earth and all who live in it, that the Sovereign Lord may bear witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.
33001003 Look! The Lord is coming from his dwelling place; he comes down and treads on the heights of the earth.
33001004 The mountains melt beneath him and the valleys split apart, like wax before the fire, like water rushing down a slope.
33001005 All this is because of Jacob’s transgression, because of the sins of the people of Israel. What is Jacob’s transgression? Is it not Samaria? What is Judah’s high place? Is it not Jerusalem?
33001006 “Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of rubble, a place for planting vineyards. I will pour her stones into the valley and lay bare her foundations.
33001007 All her idols will be broken to pieces; all her temple gifts will be burned with fire; I will destroy all her images. Since she gathered her gifts from the wages of prostitutes, as the wages of prostitutes they will again be used.”
33001008 Because of this I will weep and wail; I will go about barefoot and naked. I will howl like a jackal and moan like an owl.
33001009 For Samaria’s plague is incurable; it has spread to Judah. It has reached the very gate of my people, even to Jerusalem itself.
33001010 Tell it not in Gath ; weep not at all. In Beth Ophrah roll in the dust.
33001011 Pass by naked and in shame, you who live in Shaphir. Those who live in Zaanan will not come out. Beth Ezel is in mourning; it no longer protects you.
33001012 Those who live in Maroth writhe in pain, waiting for relief, because disaster has come from the Lord, even to the gate of Jerusalem.
33001013 You who live in Lachish, harness fast horses to the chariot. You are where the sin of Daughter Zion began, for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.
33001014 Therefore you will give parting gifts to Moresheth Gath. The town of Akzib will prove deceptive to the kings of Israel.
33001015 I will bring a conqueror against you who live in Mareshah. The nobles of Israel will flee to Adullam.
33001016 Shave your head in mourning for the children in whom you delight; make yourself as bald as the vulture, for they will go from you into exile.
33002001 Woe to those who plan iniquity, to those who plot evil on their beds! At morning’s light they carry it out because it is in their power to do it.
33002002 They covet fields and seize them, and houses, and take them. They defraud people of their homes, they rob them of their inheritance.
33002003 Therefore, the Lord says: “I am planning disaster against this people, from which you cannot save yourselves. You will no longer walk proudly, for it will be a time of calamity.
33002004 In that day people will ridicule you; they will taunt you with this mournful song: ‘We are utterly ruined; my people’s possession is divided up. He takes it from me! He assigns our fields to traitors.’ ”
33002005 Therefore you will have no one in the assembly of the Lord to divide the land by lot.
33002006 “Do not prophesy,” their prophets say. “Do not prophesy about these things; disgrace will not overtake us.”
33002007 You descendants of Jacob, should it be said, “Does the Lord become impatient? Does he do such things?” “Do not my words do good to the one whose ways are upright?
33002008 Lately my people have risen up like an enemy. You strip off the rich robe from those who pass by without a care, like men returning from battle.
33002009 You drive the women of my people from their pleasant homes. You take away my blessing from their children forever.
33002010 Get up, go away! For this is not your resting place, because it is defiled, it is ruined, beyond all remedy.
33002011 If a liar and deceiver comes and says, ‘I will prophesy for you plenty of wine and beer,’ that would be just the prophet for this people!
33002012 “I will surely gather all of you, Jacob; I will surely bring together the remnant of Israel. I will bring them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock in its pasture; the place will throng with people.
33002013 The One who breaks open the way will go up before them; they will break through the gate and go out. Their King will pass through before them, the Lord at their head.”
33003001 Then I said, “Listen, you leaders of Jacob, you rulers of Israel. Should you not embrace justice,
33003002 you who hate good and love evil; who tear the skin from my people and the flesh from their bones;
33003003 who eat my people’s flesh, strip off their skin and break their bones in pieces; who chop them up like meat for the pan, like flesh for the pot?”
33003004 Then they will cry out to the Lord, but he will not answer them. At that time he will hide his face from them because of the evil they have done.
33003005 This is what the Lord says: “As for the prophets who lead my people astray, they proclaim ‘peace’ if they have something to eat, but prepare to wage war against anyone who refuses to feed them.
33003006 Therefore night will come over you, without visions, and darkness, without divination. The sun will set for the prophets, and the day will go dark for them.
33003007 The seers will be ashamed and the diviners disgraced. They will all cover their faces because there is no answer from God.”
33003008 But as for me, I am filled with power, with the Spirit of the Lord, and with justice and might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, to Israel his sin.
33003009 Hear this, you leaders of Jacob, you rulers of Israel, who despise justice and distort all that is right;
33003010 who build Zion with bloodshed, and Jerusalem with wickedness.
33003011 Her leaders judge for a bribe, her priests teach for a price, and her prophets tell fortunes for money. Yet they look for the Lord’s support and say, “Is not the Lord among us? No disaster will come upon us.”
33003012 Therefore because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.
33004001 In the last days the mountain of the Lord’s temple will be established as the highest of the mountains; it will be exalted above the hills, and peoples will stream to it.
33004002 Many nations will come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the temple of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths.” The law will go out from Zion, the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
33004003 He will judge between many peoples and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.
33004004 Everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree, and no one will make them afraid, for the Lord Almighty has spoken.
33004005 All the nations may walk in the name of their gods, but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.
33004006 “In that day,” declares the Lord, “I will gather the lame; I will assemble the exiles and those I have brought to grief.
33004007 I will make the lame my remnant, those driven away a strong nation. The Lord will rule over them in Mount Zion from that day and forever.
33004008 As for you, watchtower of the flock, stronghold of Daughter Zion, the former dominion will be restored to you; kingship will come to Daughter Jerusalem.”
33004009 Why do you now cry aloud— have you no king ? Has your ruler perished, that pain seizes you like that of a woman in labor?
33004010 Writhe in agony, Daughter Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you must leave the city to camp in the open field. You will go to Babylon; there you will be rescued. There the Lord will redeem you out of the hand of your enemies.
33004011 But now many nations are gathered against you. They say, “Let her be defiled, let our eyes gloat over Zion!”
33004012 But they do not know the thoughts of the Lord; they do not understand his plan, that he has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor.
33004013 “Rise and thresh, Daughter Zion, for I will give you horns of iron; I will give you hooves of bronze, and you will break to pieces many nations.” You will devote their ill-gotten gains to the Lord, their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.
33005001 Marshal your troops now, city of troops, for a siege is laid against us. They will strike Israel’s ruler on the cheek with a rod.
33005002 “But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times.”
33005003 Therefore Israel will be abandoned until the time when she who is in labor bears a son, and the rest of his brothers return to join the Israelites.
33005004 He will stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God. And they will live securely, for then his greatness will reach to the ends of the earth.
33005005 And he will be our peace when the Assyrians invade our land and march through our fortresses. We will raise against them seven shepherds, even eight commanders,
33005006 who will rule the land of Assyria with the sword, the land of Nimrod with drawn sword. He will deliver us from the Assyrians when they invade our land and march across our borders.
33005007 The remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples like dew from the Lord, like showers on the grass, which do not wait for anyone or depend on man.
33005008 The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among flocks of sheep, which mauls and mangles as it goes, and no one can rescue.
33005009 Your hand will be lifted up in triumph over your enemies, and all your foes will be destroyed.
33005010 “In that day,” declares the Lord, “I will destroy your horses from among you and demolish your chariots.
33005011 I will destroy the cities of your land and tear down all your strongholds.
33005012 I will destroy your witchcraft and you will no longer cast spells.
33005013 I will destroy your idols and your sacred stones from among you; you will no longer bow down to the work of your hands.
33005014 I will uproot from among you your Asherah poles when I demolish your cities.
33005015 I will take vengeance in anger and wrath on the nations that have not obeyed me.”
33006001 Listen to what the Lord says: “Stand up, plead my case before the mountains; let the hills hear what you have to say.
33006002 “Hear, you mountains, the Lord’s accusation; listen, you everlasting foundations of the earth. For the Lord has a case against his people; he is lodging a charge against Israel.
33006003 “My people, what have I done to you? How have I burdened you? Answer me.
33006004 I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery. I sent Moses to lead you, also Aaron and Miriam.
33006005 My people, remember what Balak king of Moab plotted and what Balaam son of Beor answered. Remember your journey from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of the Lord.”
33006006 With what shall I come before the Lord and bow down before the exalted God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old?
33006007 Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousand rivers of olive oil? Shall I offer my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
33006008 He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.
33006009 Listen! The Lord is calling to the city— and to fear your name is wisdom— “Heed the rod and the One who appointed it.
33006010 Am I still to forget your ill-gotten treasures, you wicked house, and the short ephah, which is accursed?
33006011 Shall I acquit someone with dishonest scales, with a bag of false weights?
33006012 Your rich people are violent; your inhabitants are liars and their tongues speak deceitfully.
33006013 Therefore, I have begun to destroy you, to ruin you because of your sins.
33006014 You will eat but not be satisfied; your stomach will still be empty. You will store up but save nothing, because what you save I will give to the sword.
33006015 You will plant but not harvest; you will press olives but not use the oil, you will crush grapes but not drink the wine.
33006016 You have observed the statutes of Omri and all the practices of Ahab’s house; you have followed their traditions. Therefore I will give you over to ruin and your people to derision; you will bear the scorn of the nations. ”
33007001 What misery is mine! I am like one who gathers summer fruit at the gleaning of the vineyard; there is no cluster of grapes to eat, none of the early figs that I crave.
33007002 The faithful have been swept from the land; not one upright person remains. Everyone lies in wait to shed blood; they hunt each other with nets.
33007003 Both hands are skilled in doing evil; the ruler demands gifts, the judge accepts bribes, the powerful dictate what they desire— they all conspire together.
33007004 The best of them is like a brier, the most upright worse than a thorn hedge. The day God visits you has come, the day your watchmen sound the alarm. Now is the time of your confusion.
33007005 Do not trust a neighbor; put no confidence in a friend. Even with the woman who lies in your embrace guard the words of your lips.
33007006 For a son dishonors his father, a daughter rises up against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law— a man’s enemies are the members of his own household.
33007007 But as for me, I watch in hope for the Lord, I wait for God my Savior; my God will hear me.
33007008 Do not gloat over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will rise. Though I sit in darkness, the Lord will be my light.
33007009 Because I have sinned against him, I will bear the Lord’s wrath, until he pleads my case and upholds my cause. He will bring me out into the light; I will see his righteousness.
33007010 Then my enemy will see it and will be covered with shame, she who said to me, “Where is the Lord your God?” My eyes will see her downfall; even now she will be trampled underfoot like mire in the streets.
33007011 The day for building your walls will come, the day for extending your boundaries.
33007012 In that day people will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, even from Egypt to the Euphrates and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain.
33007013 The earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants, as the result of their deeds.
33007014 Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your inheritance, which lives by itself in a forest, in fertile pasturelands. Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead as in days long ago.
33007015 “As in the days when you came out of Egypt, I will show them my wonders.”
33007016 Nations will see and be ashamed, deprived of all their power. They will put their hands over their mouths and their ears will become deaf.
33007017 They will lick dust like a snake, like creatures that crawl on the ground. They will come trembling out of their dens; they will turn in fear to the Lord our God and will be afraid of you.
33007018 Who is a God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? You do not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy.
33007019 You will again have compassion on us; you will tread our sins underfoot and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea.
33007020 You will be faithful to Jacob, and show love to Abraham, as you pledged on oath to our ancestors in days long ago.
34001001 A prophecy concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
34001002 The Lord is a jealous and avenging God; the Lord takes vengeance and is filled with wrath. The Lord takes vengeance on his foes and vents his wrath against his enemies.
34001003 The Lord is slow to anger but great in power; the Lord will not leave the guilty unpunished. His way is in the whirlwind and the storm, and clouds are the dust of his feet.
34001004 He rebukes the sea and dries it up; he makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither and the blossoms of Lebanon fade.
34001005 The mountains quake before him and the hills melt away. The earth trembles at his presence, the world and all who live in it.
34001006 Who can withstand his indignation? Who can endure his fierce anger? His wrath is poured out like fire; the rocks are shattered before him.
34001007 The Lord is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him,
34001008 but with an overwhelming flood he will make an end of Nineveh; he will pursue his foes into the realm of darkness.
34001009 Whatever they plot against the Lord he will bring to an end; trouble will not come a second time.
34001010 They will be entangled among thorns and drunk from their wine; they will be consumed like dry stubble.
34001011 From you, Nineveh, has one come forth who plots evil against the Lord and devises wicked plans.
34001012 This is what the Lord says: “Although they have allies and are numerous, they will be destroyed and pass away. Although I have afflicted you, Judah, I will afflict you no more.
34001013 Now I will break their yoke from your neck and tear your shackles away.”
34001014 The Lord has given a command concerning you, Nineveh: “You will have no descendants to bear your name. I will destroy the images and idols that are in the temple of your gods. I will prepare your grave, for you are vile.”
34001015 Look, there on the mountains, the feet of one who brings good news, who proclaims peace! Celebrate your festivals, Judah, and fulfill your vows. No more will the wicked invade you; they will be completely destroyed.
34002001 An attacker advances against you, Nineveh. Guard the fortress, watch the road, brace yourselves, marshal all your strength!
34002002 The Lord will restore the splendor of Jacob like the splendor of Israel, though destroyers have laid them waste and have ruined their vines.
34002003 The shields of the soldiers are red; the warriors are clad in scarlet. The metal on the chariots flashes on the day they are made ready; the spears of juniper are brandished.
34002004 The chariots storm through the streets, rushing back and forth through the squares. They look like flaming torches; they dart about like lightning.
34002005 Nineveh summons her picked troops, yet they stumble on their way. They dash to the city wall; the protective shield is put in place.
34002006 The river gates are thrown open and the palace collapses.
34002007 It is decreed that Nineveh be exiled and carried away. Her female slaves moan like doves and beat on their breasts.
34002008 Nineveh is like a pool whose water is draining away. “Stop! Stop!” they cry, but no one turns back.
34002009 Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! The supply is endless, the wealth from all its treasures!
34002010 She is pillaged, plundered, stripped! Hearts melt, knees give way, bodies tremble, every face grows pale.
34002011 Where now is the lions’ den, the place where they fed their young, where the lion and lioness went, and the cubs, with nothing to fear?
34002012 The lion killed enough for his cubs and strangled the prey for his mate, filling his lairs with the kill and his dens with the prey.
34002013 “I am against you,” declares the Lord Almighty. “I will burn up your chariots in smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions. I will leave you no prey on the earth. The voices of your messengers will no longer be heard.”
34003001 Woe to the city of blood, full of lies, full of plunder, never without victims!
34003002 The crack of whips, the clatter of wheels, galloping horses and jolting chariots!
34003003 Charging cavalry, flashing swords and glittering spears! Many casualties, piles of dead, bodies without number, people stumbling over the corpses—
34003004 all because of the wanton lust of a prostitute, alluring, the mistress of sorceries, who enslaved nations by her prostitution and peoples by her witchcraft.
34003005 “I am against you,” declares the Lord Almighty. “I will lift your skirts over your face. I will show the nations your nakedness and the kingdoms your shame.
34003006 I will pelt you with filth, I will treat you with contempt and make you a spectacle.
34003007 All who see you will flee from you and say, ‘Nineveh is in ruins—who will mourn for her?’ Where can I find anyone to comfort you?”
34003008 Are you better than Thebes, situated on the Nile, with water around her? The river was her defense, the waters her wall.
34003009 Cush and Egypt were her boundless strength; Put and Libya were among her allies.
34003010 Yet she was taken captive and went into exile. Her infants were dashed to pieces at every street corner. Lots were cast for her nobles, and all her great men were put in chains.
34003011 You too will become drunk; you will go into hiding and seek refuge from the enemy.
34003012 All your fortresses are like fig trees with their first ripe fruit; when they are shaken, the figs fall into the mouth of the eater.
34003013 Look at your troops— they are all weaklings. The gates of your land are wide open to your enemies; fire has consumed the bars of your gates.
34003014 Draw water for the siege, strengthen your defenses! Work the clay, tread the mortar, repair the brickwork!
34003015 There the fire will consume you; the sword will cut you down— they will devour you like a swarm of locusts. Multiply like grasshoppers, multiply like locusts!
34003016 You have increased the number of your merchants till they are more numerous than the stars in the sky, but like locusts they strip the land and then fly away.
34003017 Your guards are like locusts, your officials like swarms of locusts that settle in the walls on a cold day— but when the sun appears they fly away, and no one knows where.
34003018 King of Assyria, your shepherds slumber; your nobles lie down to rest. Your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them.
34003019 Nothing can heal you; your wound is fatal. All who hear the news about you clap their hands at your fall, for who has not felt your endless cruelty?
35001001 The prophecy that Habakkuk the prophet received.
35001002 How long, Lord, must I call for help, but you do not listen? Or cry out to you, “Violence!” but you do not save?
35001003 Why do you make me look at injustice? Why do you tolerate wrongdoing? Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and conflict abounds.
35001004 Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never prevails. The wicked hem in the righteous, so that justice is perverted.
35001005 “Look at the nations and watch— and be utterly amazed. For I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told.
35001006 I am raising up the Babylonians, that ruthless and impetuous people, who sweep across the whole earth to seize dwellings not their own.
35001007 They are a feared and dreaded people; they are a law to themselves and promote their own honor.
35001008 Their horses are swifter than leopards, fiercer than wolves at dusk. Their cavalry gallops headlong; their horsemen come from afar. They fly like an eagle swooping to devour;
35001009 they all come intent on violence. Their hordes advance like a desert wind and gather prisoners like sand.
35001010 They mock kings and scoff at rulers. They laugh at all fortified cities; by building earthen ramps they capture them.
35001011 Then they sweep past like the wind and go on— guilty people, whose own strength is their god.”
35001012 Lord, are you not from everlasting? My God, my Holy One, you will never die. You, Lord, have appointed them to execute judgment; you, my Rock, have ordained them to punish.
35001013 Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; you cannot tolerate wrongdoing. Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?
35001014 You have made people like the fish in the sea, like the sea creatures that have no ruler.
35001015 The wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks, he catches them in his net, he gathers them up in his dragnet; and so he rejoices and is glad.
35001016 Therefore he sacrifices to his net and burns incense to his dragnet, for by his net he lives in luxury and enjoys the choicest food.
35001017 Is he to keep on emptying his net, destroying nations without mercy?
35002001 I will stand at my watch and station myself on the ramparts; I will look to see what he will say to me, and what answer I am to give to this complaint.
35002002 Then the Lord replied: “Write down the revelation and make it plain on tablets so that a herald may run with it.
35002003 For the revelation awaits an appointed time; it speaks of the end and will not prove false. Though it linger, wait for it; it will certainly come and will not delay.
35002004 “See, the enemy is puffed up; his desires are not upright— but the righteous person will live by his faithfulness —
35002005 indeed, wine betrays him; he is arrogant and never at rest. Because he is as greedy as the grave and like death is never satisfied, he gathers to himself all the nations and takes captive all the peoples.
35002006 “Will not all of them taunt him with ridicule and scorn, saying, “ ‘Woe to him who piles up stolen goods and makes himself wealthy by extortion! How long must this go on?’
35002007 Will not your creditors suddenly arise? Will they not wake up and make you tremble? Then you will become their prey.
35002008 Because you have plundered many nations, the peoples who are left will plunder you. For you have shed human blood; you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them.
35002009 “Woe to him who builds his house by unjust gain, setting his nest on high to escape the clutches of ruin!
35002010 You have plotted the ruin of many peoples, shaming your own house and forfeiting your life.
35002011 The stones of the wall will cry out, and the beams of the woodwork will echo it.
35002012 “Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed and establishes a town by injustice!
35002013 Has not the Lord Almighty determined that the people’s labor is only fuel for the fire, that the nations exhaust themselves for nothing?
35002014 For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.
35002015 “Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbors, pouring it from the wineskin till they are drunk, so that he can gaze on their naked bodies!
35002016 You will be filled with shame instead of glory. Now it is your turn! Drink and let your nakedness be exposed ! The cup from the Lord’s right hand is coming around to you, and disgrace will cover your glory.
35002017 The violence you have done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and your destruction of animals will terrify you. For you have shed human blood; you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them.
35002018 “Of what value is an idol carved by a craftsman? Or an image that teaches lies? For the one who makes it trusts in his own creation; he makes idols that cannot speak.
35002019 Woe to him who says to wood, ‘Come to life!’ Or to lifeless stone, ‘Wake up!’ Can it give guidance? It is covered with gold and silver; there is no breath in it.”
35002020 The Lord is in his holy temple; let all the earth be silent before him.
35003001 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet. On shigionoth.
35003002 Lord, I have heard of your fame; I stand in awe of your deeds, Lord. Repeat them in our day, in our time make them known; in wrath remember mercy.
35003003 God came from Teman, the Holy One from Mount Paran. His glory covered the heavens and his praise filled the earth.
35003004 His splendor was like the sunrise; rays flashed from his hand, where his power was hidden.
35003005 Plague went before him; pestilence followed his steps.
35003006 He stood, and shook the earth; he looked, and made the nations tremble. The ancient mountains crumbled and the age-old hills collapsed— but he marches on forever.
35003007 I saw the tents of Cushan in distress, the dwellings of Midian in anguish.
35003008 Were you angry with the rivers, Lord? Was your wrath against the streams? Did you rage against the sea when you rode your horses and your chariots to victory?
35003009 You uncovered your bow, you called for many arrows. You split the earth with rivers;
35003010 the mountains saw you and writhed. Torrents of water swept by; the deep roared and lifted its waves on high.
35003011 Sun and moon stood still in the heavens at the glint of your flying arrows, at the lightning of your flashing spear.
35003012 In wrath you strode through the earth and in anger you threshed the nations.
35003013 You came out to deliver your people, to save your anointed one. You crushed the leader of the land of wickedness, you stripped him from head to foot.
35003014 With his own spear you pierced his head when his warriors stormed out to scatter us, gloating as though about to devour the wretched who were in hiding.
35003015 You trampled the sea with your horses, churning the great waters.
35003016 I heard and my heart pounded, my lips quivered at the sound; decay crept into my bones, and my legs trembled. Yet I will wait patiently for the day of calamity to come on the nation invading us.
35003017 Though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls,
35003018 yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will be joyful in God my Savior.
35003019 The Sovereign Lord is my strength; he makes my feet like the feet of a deer, he enables me to tread on the heights.
36001001 The word of the Lord that came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, during the reign of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah:
36001002 “I will sweep away everything from the face of the earth,” declares the Lord.
36001003 “I will sweep away both man and beast; I will sweep away the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea— and the idols that cause the wicked to stumble.” “When I destroy all mankind on the face of the earth,” declares the Lord,
36001004 “I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all who live in Jerusalem. I will destroy every remnant of Baal worship in this place, the very names of the idolatrous priests—
36001005 those who bow down on the roofs to worship the starry host, those who bow down and swear by the Lord and who also swear by Molek,
36001006 those who turn back from following the Lord and neither seek the Lord nor inquire of him.”
36001007 Be silent before the Sovereign Lord, for the day of the Lord is near. The Lord has prepared a sacrifice; he has consecrated those he has invited.
36001008 “On the day of the Lord’s sacrifice I will punish the officials and the king’s sons and all those clad in foreign clothes.
36001009 On that day I will punish all who avoid stepping on the threshold, who fill the temple of their gods with violence and deceit.
36001010 “On that day,” declares the Lord, “a cry will go up from the Fish Gate, wailing from the New Quarter, and a loud crash from the hills.
36001011 Wail, you who live in the market district ; all your merchants will be wiped out, all who trade with silver will be destroyed.
36001012 At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps and punish those who are complacent, who are like wine left on its dregs, who think, ‘The Lord will do nothing, either good or bad.’
36001013 Their wealth will be plundered, their houses demolished. Though they build houses, they will not live in them; though they plant vineyards, they will not drink the wine.”
36001014 The great day of the Lord is near— near and coming quickly. The cry on the day of the Lord is bitter; the Mighty Warrior shouts his battle cry.
36001015 That day will be a day of wrath— a day of distress and anguish, a day of trouble and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness—
36001016 a day of trumpet and battle cry against the fortified cities and against the corner towers.
36001017 “I will bring such distress on all people that they will grope about like those who are blind, because they have sinned against the Lord. Their blood will be poured out like dust and their entrails like dung.
36001018 Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them on the day of the Lord’s wrath.” In the fire of his jealousy the whole earth will be consumed, for he will make a sudden end of all who live on the earth.
36002001 Gather together, gather yourselves together, you shameful nation,
36002002 before the decree takes effect and that day passes like windblown chaff, before the Lord’s fierce anger comes upon you, before the day of the Lord’s wrath comes upon you.
36002003 Seek the Lord, all you humble of the land, you who do what he commands. Seek righteousness, seek humility; perhaps you will be sheltered on the day of the Lord’s anger.
36002004 Gaza will be abandoned and Ashkelon left in ruins. At midday Ashdod will be emptied and Ekron uprooted.
36002005 Woe to you who live by the sea, you Kerethite people; the word of the Lord is against you, Canaan, land of the Philistines. He says, “I will destroy you, and none will be left.”
36002006 The land by the sea will become pastures having wells for shepherds and pens for flocks.
36002007 That land will belong to the remnant of the people of Judah; there they will find pasture. In the evening they will lie down in the houses of Ashkelon. The Lord their God will care for them; he will restore their fortunes.
36002008 “I have heard the insults of Moab and the taunts of the Ammonites, who insulted my people and made threats against their land.
36002009 Therefore, as surely as I live,” declares the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, “surely Moab will become like Sodom, the Ammonites like Gomorrah— a place of weeds and salt pits, a wasteland forever. The remnant of my people will plunder them; the survivors of my nation will inherit their land.”
36002010 This is what they will get in return for their pride, for insulting and mocking the people of the Lord Almighty.
36002011 The Lord will be awesome to them when he destroys all the gods of the earth. Distant nations will bow down to him, all of them in their own lands.
36002012 “You Cushites, too, will be slain by my sword.”
36002013 He will stretch out his hand against the north and destroy Assyria, leaving Nineveh utterly desolate and dry as the desert.
36002014 Flocks and herds will lie down there, creatures of every kind. The desert owl and the screech owl will roost on her columns. Their hooting will echo through the windows, rubble will fill the doorways, the beams of cedar will be exposed.
36002015 This is the city of revelry that lived in safety. She said to herself, “I am the one! And there is none besides me.” What a ruin she has become, a lair for wild beasts! All who pass by her scoff and shake their fists.
36003001 Woe to the city of oppressors, rebellious and defiled!
36003002 She obeys no one, she accepts no correction. She does not trust in the Lord, she does not draw near to her God.
36003003 Her officials within her are roaring lions; her rulers are evening wolves, who leave nothing for the morning.
36003004 Her prophets are unprincipled; they are treacherous people. Her priests profane the sanctuary and do violence to the law.
36003005 The Lord within her is righteous; he does no wrong. Morning by morning he dispenses his justice, and every new day he does not fail, yet the unrighteous know no shame.
36003006 “I have destroyed nations; their strongholds are demolished. I have left their streets deserted, with no one passing through. Their cities are laid waste; they are deserted and empty.
36003007 Of Jerusalem I thought, ‘Surely you will fear me and accept correction!’ Then her place of refuge would not be destroyed, nor all my punishments come upon her. But they were still eager to act corruptly in all they did.
36003008 Therefore wait for me,” declares the Lord, “for the day I will stand up to testify. I have decided to assemble the nations, to gather the kingdoms and to pour out my wrath on them— all my fierce anger. The whole world will be consumed by the fire of my jealous anger.
36003009 “Then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that all of them may call on the name of the Lord and serve him shoulder to shoulder.
36003010 From beyond the rivers of Cush my worshipers, my scattered people, will bring me offerings.
36003011 On that day you, Jerusalem, will not be put to shame for all the wrongs you have done to me, because I will remove from you your arrogant boasters. Never again will you be haughty on my holy hill.
36003012 But I will leave within you the meek and humble. The remnant of Israel will trust in the name of the Lord.
36003013 They will do no wrong; they will tell no lies. A deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouths. They will eat and lie down and no one will make them afraid.”
36003014 Sing, Daughter Zion; shout aloud, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, Daughter Jerusalem!
36003015 The Lord has taken away your punishment, he has turned back your enemy. The Lord, the King of Israel, is with you; never again will you fear any harm.
36003016 On that day they will say to Jerusalem, “Do not fear, Zion; do not let your hands hang limp.
36003017 The Lord your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you; in his love he will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice over you with singing.”
36003018 “I will remove from you all who mourn over the loss of your appointed festivals, which is a burden and reproach for you.
36003019 At that time I will deal with all who oppressed you. I will rescue the lame; I will gather the exiles. I will give them praise and honor in every land where they have suffered shame.
36003020 At that time I will gather you; at that time I will bring you home. I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth when I restore your fortunes before your very eyes,” says the Lord..
37001001 In the second year of King Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest:
37001002 This is what the Lord Almighty says: “These people say, ‘The time has not yet come to rebuild the Lord’s house.’ ”
37001003 Then the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai:
37001004 “Is it a time for you yourselves to be living in your paneled houses, while this house remains a ruin?”
37001005 Now this is what the Lord Almighty says: “Give careful thought to your ways.
37001006 You have planted much, but harvested little. You eat, but never have enough. You drink, but never have your fill. You put on clothes, but are not warm. You earn wages, only to put them in a purse with holes in it.”
37001007 This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Give careful thought to your ways.
37001008 Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build my house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored,” says the Lord.
37001009 “You expected much, but see, it turned out to be little. What you brought home, I blew away. Why?” declares the Lord Almighty. “Because of my house, which remains a ruin, while each of you is busy with your own house.
37001010 Therefore, because of you the heavens have withheld their dew and the earth its crops.
37001011 I called for a drought on the fields and the mountains, on the grain, the new wine, the olive oil and everything else the ground produces, on people and livestock, and on all the labor of your hands.”
37001012 Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest, and the whole remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the Lord their God and the message of the prophet Haggai, because the Lord their God had sent him. And the people feared the Lord.
37001013 Then Haggai, the Lord’s messenger, gave this message of the Lord to the people: “I am with you,” declares the Lord.
37001014 So the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of the whole remnant of the people. They came and began to work on the house of the Lord Almighty, their God,
37001015 on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month. In the second year of King Darius,
37002001 on the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai:
37002002 “Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people. Ask them,
37002003 ‘Who of you is left who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Does it not seem to you like nothing?
37002004 But now be strong, Zerubbabel,’ declares the Lord. ‘Be strong, Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,’ declares the Lord, ‘and work. For I am with you,’ declares the Lord Almighty.
37002005 ‘This is what I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt. And my Spirit remains among you. Do not fear.’
37002006 “This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘In a little while I will once more shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land.
37002007 I will shake all nations, and what is desired by all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,’ says the Lord Almighty.
37002008 ‘The silver is mine and the gold is mine,’ declares the Lord Almighty.
37002009 ‘The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house,’ says the Lord Almighty. ‘And in this place I will grant peace,’ declares the Lord Almighty.”
37002010 On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Haggai:
37002011 “This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘Ask the priests what the law says:
37002012 If someone carries consecrated meat in the fold of their garment, and that fold touches some bread or stew, some wine, olive oil or other food, does it become consecrated?’ ” The priests answered, “No.”
37002013 Then Haggai said, “If a person defiled by contact with a dead body touches one of these things, does it become defiled?” “Yes,” the priests replied, “it becomes defiled.”
37002014 Then Haggai said, “ ‘So it is with this people and this nation in my sight,’ declares the Lord. ‘Whatever they do and whatever they offer there is defiled.
37002015 “ ‘Now give careful thought to this from this day on —consider how things were before one stone was laid on another in the Lord’s temple.
37002016 When anyone came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When anyone went to a wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were only twenty.
37002017 I struck all the work of your hands with blight, mildew and hail, yet you did not return to me,’ declares the Lord.
37002018 ‘From this day on, from this twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, give careful thought to the day when the foundation of the Lord’s temple was laid. Give careful thought:
37002019 Is there yet any seed left in the barn? Until now, the vine and the fig tree, the pomegranate and the olive tree have not borne fruit. “ ‘From this day on I will bless you.’ ”
37002020 The word of the Lord came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month:
37002021 “Tell Zerubbabel governor of Judah that I am going to shake the heavens and the earth.
37002022 I will overturn royal thrones and shatter the power of the foreign kingdoms. I will overthrow chariots and their drivers; horses and their riders will fall, each by the sword of his brother.
37002023 “ ‘On that day,’ declares the Lord Almighty, ‘I will take you, my servant Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,’ declares the Lord, ‘and I will make you like my signet ring, for I have chosen you,’ declares the Lord Almighty.”
38001001 In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo:
38001002 “The Lord was very angry with your ancestors.
38001003 Therefore tell the people: This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘Return to me,’ declares the Lord Almighty, ‘and I will return to you,’ says the Lord Almighty.
38001004 Do not be like your ancestors, to whom the earlier prophets proclaimed: This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘Turn from your evil ways and your evil practices.’ But they would not listen or pay attention to me, declares the Lord.
38001005 Where are your ancestors now? And the prophets, do they live forever?
38001006 But did not my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, overtake your ancestors? “Then they repented and said, ‘The Lord Almighty has done to us what our ways and practices deserve, just as he determined to do.’ ”
38001007 On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo.
38001008 During the night I had a vision, and there before me was a man mounted on a red horse. He was standing among the myrtle trees in a ravine. Behind him were red, brown and white horses.
38001009 I asked, “What are these, my lord?” The angel who was talking with me answered, “I will show you what they are.”
38001010 Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, “They are the ones the Lord has sent to go throughout the earth.”
38001011 And they reported to the angel of the Lord who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We have gone throughout the earth and found the whole world at rest and in peace.”
38001012 Then the angel of the Lord said, “Lord Almighty, how long will you withhold mercy from Jerusalem and from the towns of Judah, which you have been angry with these seventy years?”
38001013 So the Lord spoke kind and comforting words to the angel who talked with me.
38001014 Then the angel who was speaking to me said, “Proclaim this word: This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘I am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion,
38001015 and I am very angry with the nations that feel secure. I was only a little angry, but they went too far with the punishment.’
38001016 “Therefore this is what the Lord says: ‘I will return to Jerusalem with mercy, and there my house will be rebuilt. And the measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem,’ declares the Lord Almighty.
38001017 “Proclaim further: This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘My towns will again overflow with prosperity, and the Lord will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.’ ”
38001018 Then I looked up, and there before me were four horns.
38001019 I asked the angel who was speaking to me, “What are these?” He answered me, “These are the horns that scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.”
38001020 Then the Lord showed me four craftsmen.
38001021 I asked, “What are these coming to do?” He answered, “These are the horns that scattered Judah so that no one could raise their head, but the craftsmen have come to terrify them and throw down these horns of the nations who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter its people.”
38002001 Then I looked up, and there before me was a man with a measuring line in his hand.
38002002 I asked, “Where are you going?” He answered me, “To measure Jerusalem, to find out how wide and how long it is.”
38002003 While the angel who was speaking to me was leaving, another angel came to meet him
38002004 and said to him: “Run, tell that young man, ‘Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the great number of people and animals in it.
38002005 And I myself will be a wall of fire around it,’ declares the Lord, ‘and I will be its glory within.’
38002006 “Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,” declares the Lord, “for I have scattered you to the four winds of heaven,” declares the Lord.
38002007 “Come, Zion! Escape, you who live in Daughter Babylon!”
38002008 For this is what the Lord Almighty says: “After the Glorious One has sent me against the nations that have plundered you—for whoever touches you touches the apple of his eye—
38002009 I will surely raise my hand against them so that their slaves will plunder them. Then you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me.
38002010 “Shout and be glad, Daughter Zion. For I am coming, and I will live among you,” declares the Lord.
38002011 “Many nations will be joined with the Lord in that day and will become my people. I will live among you and you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you.
38002012 The Lord will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land and will again choose Jerusalem.
38002013 Be still before the Lord, all mankind, because he has roused himself from his holy dwelling.”
38003001 Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right side to accuse him.
38003002 The Lord said to Satan, “The Lord rebuke you, Satan! The Lord, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a burning stick snatched from the fire?”
38003003 Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel.
38003004 The angel said to those who were standing before him, “Take off his filthy clothes.” Then he said to Joshua, “See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put fine garments on you.”
38003005 Then I said, “Put a clean turban on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him, while the angel of the Lord stood by.
38003006 The angel of the Lord gave this charge to Joshua:
38003007 “This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘If you will walk in obedience to me and keep my requirements, then you will govern my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you a place among these standing here.
38003008 “ ‘Listen, High Priest Joshua, you and your associates seated before you, who are men symbolic of things to come: I am going to bring my servant, the Branch.
38003009 See, the stone I have set in front of Joshua! There are seven eyes on that one stone, and I will engrave an inscription on it,’ says the Lord Almighty, ‘and I will remove the sin of this land in a single day.
38003010 “ ‘In that day each of you will invite your neighbor to sit under your vine and fig tree,’ declares the Lord Almighty.”
38004001 Then the angel who talked with me returned and woke me up, like someone awakened from sleep.
38004002 He asked me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lamps on it, with seven channels to the lamps.
38004003 Also there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.”
38004004 I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”
38004005 He answered, “Do you not know what these are?” “No, my lord,” I replied.
38004006 So he said to me, “This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says the Lord Almighty.
38004007 “What are you, mighty mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become level ground. Then he will bring out the capstone to shouts of ‘God bless it! God bless it!’ ”
38004008 Then the word of the Lord came to me:
38004009 “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this temple; his hands will also complete it. Then you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you.
38004010 “Who dares despise the day of small things, since the seven eyes of the Lord that range throughout the earth will rejoice when they see the chosen capstone in the hand of Zerubbabel?”
38004011 Then I asked the angel, “What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?”
38004012 Again I asked him, “What are these two olive branches beside the two gold pipes that pour out golden oil?”
38004013 He replied, “Do you not know what these are?” “No, my lord,” I said.
38004014 So he said, “These are the two who are anointed to serve the Lord of all the earth.”
38005001 I looked again, and there before me was a flying scroll.
38005002 He asked me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a flying scroll, twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide. ”
38005003 And he said to me, “This is the curse that is going out over the whole land; for according to what it says on one side, every thief will be banished, and according to what it says on the other, everyone who swears falsely will be banished.
38005004 The Lord Almighty declares, ‘I will send it out, and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of anyone who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in that house and destroy it completely, both its timbers and its stones.’ ”
38005005 Then the angel who was speaking to me came forward and said to me, “Look up and see what is appearing.”
38005006 I asked, “What is it?” He replied, “It is a basket.” And he added, “This is the iniquity of the people throughout the land.”
38005007 Then the cover of lead was raised, and there in the basket sat a woman!
38005008 He said, “This is wickedness,” and he pushed her back into the basket and pushed its lead cover down on it.
38005009 Then I looked up—and there before me were two women, with the wind in their wings! They had wings like those of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between heaven and earth.
38005010 “Where are they taking the basket?” I asked the angel who was speaking to me.
38005011 He replied, “To the country of Babylonia to build a house for it. When the house is ready, the basket will be set there in its place.”
38006001 I looked up again, and there before me were four chariots coming out from between two mountains—mountains of bronze.
38006002 The first chariot had red horses, the second black,
38006003 the third white, and the fourth dappled—all of them powerful.
38006004 I asked the angel who was speaking to me, “What are these, my lord?”
38006005 The angel answered me, “These are the four spirits of heaven, going out from standing in the presence of the Lord of the whole world.
38006006 The one with the black horses is going toward the north country, the one with the white horses toward the west, and the one with the dappled horses toward the south.”
38006007 When the powerful horses went out, they were straining to go throughout the earth. And he said, “Go throughout the earth!” So they went throughout the earth.
38006008 Then he called to me, “Look, those going toward the north country have given my Spirit rest in the land of the north.”
38006009 The word of the Lord came to me:
38006010 “Take silver and gold from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon. Go the same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah.
38006011 Take the silver and gold and make a crown, and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of Jozadak.
38006012 Tell him this is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘Here is the man whose name is the Branch, and he will branch out from his place and build the temple of the Lord.
38006013 It is he who will build the temple of the Lord, and he will be clothed with majesty and will sit and rule on his throne. And he will be a priest on his throne. And there will be harmony between the two.’
38006014 The crown will be given to Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen son of Zephaniah as a memorial in the temple of the Lord.
38006015 Those who are far away will come and help to build the temple of the Lord, and you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you. This will happen if you diligently obey the Lord your God.”
38007001 In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, the month of Kislev.
38007002 The people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-Melek, together with their men, to entreat the Lord
38007003 by asking the priests of the house of the Lord Almighty and the prophets, “Should I mourn and fast in the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?”
38007004 Then the word of the Lord Almighty came to me:
38007005 “Ask all the people of the land and the priests, ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months for the past seventy years, was it really for me that you fasted?
38007006 And when you were eating and drinking, were you not just feasting for yourselves?
38007007 Are these not the words the Lord proclaimed through the earlier prophets when Jerusalem and its surrounding towns were at rest and prosperous, and the Negev and the western foothills were settled?’ ”
38007008 And the word of the Lord came again to Zechariah:
38007009 “This is what the Lord Almighty said: ‘Administer true justice; show mercy and compassion to one another.
38007010 Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the foreigner or the poor. Do not plot evil against each other.’
38007011 “But they refused to pay attention; stubbornly they turned their backs and covered their ears.
38007012 They made their hearts as hard as flint and would not listen to the law or to the words that the Lord Almighty had sent by his Spirit through the earlier prophets. So the Lord Almighty was very angry.
38007013 “ ‘When I called, they did not listen; so when they called, I would not listen,’ says the Lord Almighty.
38007014 ‘I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations, where they were strangers. The land they left behind them was so desolate that no one traveled through it. This is how they made the pleasant land desolate.’ ”
38008001 The word of the Lord Almighty came to me.
38008002 This is what the Lord Almighty says: “I am very jealous for Zion; I am burning with jealousy for her.”
38008003 This is what the Lord says: “I will return to Zion and dwell in Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the Faithful City, and the mountain of the Lord Almighty will be called the Holy Mountain.”
38008004 This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Once again men and women of ripe old age will sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each of them with cane in hand because of their age.
38008005 The city streets will be filled with boys and girls playing there.”
38008006 This is what the Lord Almighty says: “It may seem marvelous to the remnant of this people at that time, but will it seem marvelous to me?” declares the Lord Almighty.
38008007 This is what the Lord Almighty says: “I will save my people from the countries of the east and the west.
38008008 I will bring them back to live in Jerusalem; they will be my people, and I will be faithful and righteous to them as their God.”
38008009 This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Now hear these words, ‘Let your hands be strong so that the temple may be built.’ This is also what the prophets said who were present when the foundation was laid for the house of the Lord Almighty.
38008010 Before that time there were no wages for people or hire for animals. No one could go about their business safely because of their enemies, since I had turned everyone against their neighbor.
38008011 But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as I did in the past,” declares the Lord Almighty.
38008012 “The seed will grow well, the vine will yield its fruit, the ground will produce its crops, and the heavens will drop their dew. I will give all these things as an inheritance to the remnant of this people.
38008013 Just as you, Judah and Israel, have been a curse among the nations, so I will save you, and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid, but let your hands be strong.”
38008014 This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Just as I had determined to bring disaster on you and showed no pity when your ancestors angered me,” says the Lord Almighty,
38008015 “so now I have determined to do good again to Jerusalem and Judah. Do not be afraid.
38008016 These are the things you are to do: Speak the truth to each other, and render true and sound judgment in your courts;
38008017 do not plot evil against each other, and do not love to swear falsely. I hate all this,” declares the Lord.
38008018 The word of the Lord Almighty came to me.
38008019 This is what the Lord Almighty says: “The fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh and tenth months will become joyful and glad occasions and happy festivals for Judah. Therefore love truth and peace.”
38008020 This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Many peoples and the inhabitants of many cities will yet come,
38008021 and the inhabitants of one city will go to another and say, ‘Let us go at once to entreat the Lord and seek the Lord Almighty. I myself am going.’
38008022 And many peoples and powerful nations will come to Jerusalem to seek the Lord Almighty and to entreat him.”
38008023 This is what the Lord Almighty says: “In those days ten people from all languages and nations will take firm hold of one Jew by the hem of his robe and say, ‘Let us go with you, because we have heard that God is with you.’ ”
38009001 A prophecy: The word of the Lord is against the land of Hadrak and will come to rest on Damascus— for the eyes of all people and all the tribes of Israel are on the Lord—
38009002 and on Hamath too, which borders on it, and on Tyre and Sidon, though they are very skillful.
38009003 Tyre has built herself a stronghold; she has heaped up silver like dust, and gold like the dirt of the streets.
38009004 But the Lord will take away her possessions and destroy her power on the sea, and she will be consumed by fire.
38009005 Ashkelon will see it and fear; Gaza will writhe in agony, and Ekron too, for her hope will wither. Gaza will lose her king and Ashkelon will be deserted.
38009006 A mongrel people will occupy Ashdod, and I will put an end to the pride of the Philistines.
38009007 I will take the blood from their mouths, the forbidden food from between their teeth. Those who are left will belong to our God and become a clan in Judah, and Ekron will be like the Jebusites.
38009008 But I will encamp at my temple to guard it against marauding forces. Never again will an oppressor overrun my people, for now I am keeping watch.
38009009 Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion! Shout, Daughter Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and victorious, lowly and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
38009010 I will take away the chariots from Ephraim and the warhorses from Jerusalem, and the battle bow will be broken. He will proclaim peace to the nations. His rule will extend from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth.
38009011 As for you, because of the blood of my covenant with you, I will free your prisoners from the waterless pit.
38009012 Return to your fortress, you prisoners of hope; even now I announce that I will restore twice as much to you.
38009013 I will bend Judah as I bend my bow and fill it with Ephraim. I will rouse your sons, Zion, against your sons, Greece, and make you like a warrior’s sword.
38009014 Then the Lord will appear over them; his arrow will flash like lightning. The Sovereign Lord will sound the trumpet; he will march in the storms of the south,
38009015 and the Lord Almighty will shield them. They will destroy and overcome with slingstones. They will drink and roar as with wine; they will be full like a bowl used for sprinkling the corners of the altar.
38009016 The Lord their God will save his people on that day as a shepherd saves his flock. They will sparkle in his land like jewels in a crown.
38009017 How attractive and beautiful they will be! Grain will make the young men thrive, and new wine the young women.
38010001 Ask the Lord for rain in the springtime; it is the Lord who sends the thunderstorms. He gives showers of rain to all people, and plants of the field to everyone.
38010002 The idols speak deceitfully, diviners see visions that lie; they tell dreams that are false, they give comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep oppressed for lack of a shepherd.
38010003 “My anger burns against the shepherds, and I will punish the leaders; for the Lord Almighty will care for his flock, the people of Judah, and make them like a proud horse in battle.
38010004 From Judah will come the cornerstone, from him the tent peg, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler.
38010005 Together they will be like warriors in battle trampling their enemy into the mud of the streets. They will fight because the Lord is with them, and they will put the enemy horsemen to shame.
38010006 “I will strengthen Judah and save the tribes of Joseph. I will restore them because I have compassion on them. They will be as though I had not rejected them, for I am the Lord their God and I will answer them.
38010007 The Ephraimites will become like warriors, and their hearts will be glad as with wine. Their children will see it and be joyful; their hearts will rejoice in the Lord.
38010008 I will signal for them and gather them in. Surely I will redeem them; they will be as numerous as before.
38010009 Though I scatter them among the peoples, yet in distant lands they will remember me. They and their children will survive, and they will return.
38010010 I will bring them back from Egypt and gather them from Assyria. I will bring them to Gilead and Lebanon, and there will not be room enough for them.
38010011 They will pass through the sea of trouble; the surging sea will be subdued and all the depths of the Nile will dry up. Assyria’s pride will be brought down and Egypt’s scepter will pass away.
38010012 I will strengthen them in the Lord and in his name they will live securely,” declares the Lord.
38011001 Open your doors, Lebanon, so that fire may devour your cedars!
38011002 Wail, you juniper, for the cedar has fallen; the stately trees are ruined! Wail, oaks of Bashan; the dense forest has been cut down!
38011003 Listen to the wail of the shepherds; their rich pastures are destroyed! Listen to the roar of the lions; the lush thicket of the Jordan is ruined!
38011004 This is what the Lord my God says: “Shepherd the flock marked for slaughter.
38011005 Their buyers slaughter them and go unpunished. Those who sell them say, ‘Praise the Lord, I am rich!’ Their own shepherds do not spare them.
38011006 For I will no longer have pity on the people of the land,” declares the Lord. “I will give everyone into the hands of their neighbors and their king. They will devastate the land, and I will not rescue anyone from their hands.”
38011007 So I shepherded the flock marked for slaughter, particularly the oppressed of the flock. Then I took two staffs and called one Favor and the other Union, and I shepherded the flock.
38011008 In one month I got rid of the three shepherds. The flock detested me, and I grew weary of them
38011009 and said, “I will not be your shepherd. Let the dying die, and the perishing perish. Let those who are left eat one another’s flesh.”
38011010 Then I took my staff called Favor and broke it, revoking the covenant I had made with all the nations.
38011011 It was revoked on that day, and so the oppressed of the flock who were watching me knew it was the word of the Lord.
38011012 I told them, “If you think it best, give me my pay; but if not, keep it.” So they paid me thirty pieces of silver.
38011013 And the Lord said to me, “Throw it to the potter”—the handsome price at which they valued me! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter at the house of the Lord.
38011014 Then I broke my second staff called Union, breaking the family bond between Judah and Israel.
38011015 Then the Lord said to me, “Take again the equipment of a foolish shepherd.
38011016 For I am going to raise up a shepherd over the land who will not care for the lost, or seek the young, or heal the injured, or feed the healthy, but will eat the meat of the choice sheep, tearing off their hooves.
38011017 “Woe to the worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock! May the sword strike his arm and his right eye! May his arm be completely withered, his right eye totally blinded!”
38012001 A prophecy: The word of the Lord concerning Israel. The Lord, who stretches out the heavens, who lays the foundation of the earth, and who forms the human spirit within a person, declares:
38012002 “I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that sends all the surrounding peoples reeling. Judah will be besieged as well as Jerusalem.
38012003 On that day, when all the nations of the earth are gathered against her, I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock for all the nations. All who try to move it will injure themselves.
38012004 On that day I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness,” declares the Lord. “I will keep a watchful eye over Judah, but I will blind all the horses of the nations.
38012005 Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, ‘The people of Jerusalem are strong, because the Lord Almighty is their God.’
38012006 “On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile, like a flaming torch among sheaves. They will consume all the surrounding peoples right and left, but Jerusalem will remain intact in her place.
38012007 “The Lord will save the dwellings of Judah first, so that the honor of the house of David and of Jerusalem’s inhabitants may not be greater than that of Judah.
38012008 On that day the Lord will shield those who live in Jerusalem, so that the feeblest among them will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the Lord going before them.
38012009 On that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem.
38012010 “And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication. They will look on me, the one they have pierced, and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only child, and grieve bitterly for him as one grieves for a firstborn son.
38012011 On that day the weeping in Jerusalem will be as great as the weeping of Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
38012012 The land will mourn, each clan by itself, with their wives by themselves: the clan of the house of David and their wives, the clan of the house of Nathan and their wives,
38012013 the clan of the house of Levi and their wives, the clan of Shimei and their wives,
38012014 and all the rest of the clans and their wives.
38013001 “On that day a fountain will be opened to the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and impurity.
38013002 “On that day, I will banish the names of the idols from the land, and they will be remembered no more,” declares the Lord Almighty. “I will remove both the prophets and the spirit of impurity from the land.
38013003 And if anyone still prophesies, their father and mother, to whom they were born, will say to them, ‘You must die, because you have told lies in the Lord’s name.’ Then their own parents will stab the one who prophesies.
38013004 “On that day every prophet will be ashamed of their prophetic vision. They will not put on a prophet’s garment of hair in order to deceive.
38013005 Each will say, ‘I am not a prophet. I am a farmer; the land has been my livelihood since my youth. ’
38013006 If someone asks, ‘What are these wounds on your body ?’ they will answer, ‘The wounds I was given at the house of my friends.’
38013007 “Awake, sword, against my shepherd, against the man who is close to me!” declares the Lord Almighty. “Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered, and I will turn my hand against the little ones.
38013008 In the whole land,” declares the Lord, “two-thirds will be struck down and perish; yet one-third will be left in it.
38013009 This third I will put into the fire; I will refine them like silver and test them like gold. They will call on my name and I will answer them; I will say, ‘They are my people,’ and they will say, ‘The Lord is our God.’ ”
38014001 A day of the Lord is coming, Jerusalem, when your possessions will be plundered and divided up within your very walls.
38014002 I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem to fight against it; the city will be captured, the houses ransacked, and the women raped. Half of the city will go into exile, but the rest of the people will not be taken from the city.
38014003 Then the Lord will go out and fight against those nations, as he fights on a day of battle.
38014004 On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a great valley, with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south.
38014005 You will flee by my mountain valley, for it will extend to Azel. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the Lord my God will come, and all the holy ones with him.
38014006 On that day there will be neither sunlight nor cold, frosty darkness.
38014007 It will be a unique day—a day known only to the Lord—with no distinction between day and night. When evening comes, there will be light.
38014008 On that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem, half of it east to the Dead Sea and half of it west to the Mediterranean Sea, in summer and in winter.
38014009 The Lord will be king over the whole earth. On that day there will be one Lord, and his name the only name.
38014010 The whole land, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, will become like the Arabah. But Jerusalem will be raised up high from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses, and will remain in its place.
38014011 It will be inhabited; never again will it be destroyed. Jerusalem will be secure.
38014012 This is the plague with which the Lord will strike all the nations that fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.
38014013 On that day people will be stricken by the Lord with great panic. They will seize each other by the hand and attack one another.
38014014 Judah too will fight at Jerusalem. The wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected—great quantities of gold and silver and clothing.
38014015 A similar plague will strike the horses and mules, the camels and donkeys, and all the animals in those camps.
38014016 Then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the Lord Almighty, and to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles.
38014017 If any of the peoples of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord Almighty, they will have no rain.
38014018 If the Egyptian people do not go up and take part, they will have no rain. The Lord will bring on them the plague he inflicts on the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles.
38014019 This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles.
38014020 On that day holy to the Lord will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, and the cooking pots in the Lord’s house will be like the sacred bowls in front of the altar.
38014021 Every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the Lord Almighty, and all who come to sacrifice will take some of the pots and cook in them. And on that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the Lord Almighty.
39001001 A prophecy: The word of the Lord to Israel through Malachi.
39001002 “I have loved you,” says the Lord. “But you ask, ‘How have you loved us?’ “Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?” declares the Lord. “Yet I have loved Jacob,
39001003 but Esau I have hated, and I have turned his hill country into a wasteland and left his inheritance to the desert jackals.”
39001004 Edom may say, “Though we have been crushed, we will rebuild the ruins.” But this is what the Lord Almighty says: “They may build, but I will demolish. They will be called the Wicked Land, a people always under the wrath of the Lord.
39001005 You will see it with your own eyes and say, ‘Great is the Lord—even beyond the borders of Israel!’
39001006 “A son honors his father, and a slave his master. If I am a father, where is the honor due me? If I am a master, where is the respect due me?” says the Lord Almighty. “It is you priests who show contempt for my name. “But you ask, ‘How have we shown contempt for your name?’
39001007 “By offering defiled food on my altar. “But you ask, ‘How have we defiled you?’ “By saying that the Lord’s table is contemptible.
39001008 When you offer blind animals for sacrifice, is that not wrong? When you sacrifice lame or diseased animals, is that not wrong? Try offering them to your governor! Would he be pleased with you? Would he accept you?” says the Lord Almighty.
39001009 “Now plead with God to be gracious to us. With such offerings from your hands, will he accept you?”—says the Lord Almighty.
39001010 “Oh, that one of you would shut the temple doors, so that you would not light useless fires on my altar! I am not pleased with you,” says the Lord Almighty, “and I will accept no offering from your hands.
39001011 My name will be great among the nations, from where the sun rises to where it sets. In every place incense and pure offerings will be brought to me, because my name will be great among the nations,” says the Lord Almighty.
39001012 “But you profane it by saying, ‘The Lord’s table is defiled,’ and, ‘Its food is contemptible.’
39001013 And you say, ‘What a burden!’ and you sniff at it contemptuously,” says the Lord Almighty. “When you bring injured, lame or diseased animals and offer them as sacrifices, should I accept them from your hands?” says the Lord.
39001014 “Cursed is the cheat who has an acceptable male in his flock and vows to give it, but then sacrifices a blemished animal to the Lord. For I am a great king,” says the Lord Almighty, “and my name is to be feared among the nations.
39002001 “And now, you priests, this warning is for you.
39002002 If you do not listen, and if you do not resolve to honor my name,” says the Lord Almighty, “I will send a curse on you, and I will curse your blessings. Yes, I have already cursed them, because you have not resolved to honor me.
39002003 “Because of you I will rebuke your descendants ; I will smear on your faces the dung from your festival sacrifices, and you will be carried off with it.
39002004 And you will know that I have sent you this warning so that my covenant with Levi may continue,” says the Lord Almighty.
39002005 “My covenant was with him, a covenant of life and peace, and I gave them to him; this called for reverence and he revered me and stood in awe of my name.
39002006 True instruction was in his mouth and nothing false was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many from sin.
39002007 “For the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge, because he is the messenger of the Lord Almighty and people seek instruction from his mouth.
39002008 But you have turned from the way and by your teaching have caused many to stumble; you have violated the covenant with Levi,” says the Lord Almighty.
39002009 “So I have caused you to be despised and humiliated before all the people, because you have not followed my ways but have shown partiality in matters of the law.”
39002010 Do we not all have one Father ? Did not one God create us? Why do we profane the covenant of our ancestors by being unfaithful to one another?
39002011 Judah has been unfaithful. A detestable thing has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem: Judah has desecrated the sanctuary the Lord loves by marrying women who worship a foreign god.
39002012 As for the man who does this, whoever he may be, may the Lord remove him from the tents of Jacob —even though he brings an offering to the Lord Almighty.
39002013 Another thing you do: You flood the Lord’s altar with tears. You weep and wail because he no longer looks with favor on your offerings or accepts them with pleasure from your hands.
39002014 You ask, “Why?” It is because the Lord is the witness between you and the wife of your youth. You have been unfaithful to her, though she is your partner, the wife of your marriage covenant.
39002015 Has not the one God made you? You belong to him in body and spirit. And what does the one God seek? Godly offspring. So be on your guard, and do not be unfaithful to the wife of your youth.
39002016 “The man who hates and divorces his wife,” says the Lord, the God of Israel, “does violence to the one he should protect,” says the Lord Almighty. So be on your guard, and do not be unfaithful.
39002017 You have wearied the Lord with your words. “How have we wearied him?” you ask. By saying, “All who do evil are good in the eyes of the Lord, and he is pleased with them” or “Where is the God of justice?”
39003001 “I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come,” says the Lord Almighty.
39003002 But who can endure the day of his coming? Who can stand when he appears? For he will be like a refiner’s fire or a launderer’s soap.
39003003 He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; he will purify the Levites and refine them like gold and silver. Then the Lord will have men who will bring offerings in righteousness,
39003004 and the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be acceptable to the Lord, as in days gone by, as in former years.
39003005 “So I will come to put you on trial. I will be quick to testify against sorcerers, adulterers and perjurers, against those who defraud laborers of their wages, who oppress the widows and the fatherless, and deprive the foreigners among you of justice, but do not fear me,” says the Lord Almighty.
39003006 “I the Lord do not change. So you, the descendants of Jacob, are not destroyed.
39003007 Ever since the time of your ancestors you have turned away from my decrees and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you,” says the Lord Almighty. “But you ask, ‘How are we to return?’
39003008 “Will a mere mortal rob God? Yet you rob me. “But you ask, ‘How are we robbing you?’ “In tithes and offerings.
39003009 You are under a curse—your whole nation—because you are robbing me.
39003010 Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this,” says the Lord Almighty, “and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it.
39003011 I will prevent pests from devouring your crops, and the vines in your fields will not drop their fruit before it is ripe,” says the Lord Almighty.
39003012 “Then all the nations will call you blessed, for yours will be a delightful land,” says the Lord Almighty.
39003013 “You have spoken arrogantly against me,” says the Lord. “Yet you ask, ‘What have we said against you?’
39003014 “You have said, ‘It is futile to serve God. What do we gain by carrying out his requirements and going about like mourners before the Lord Almighty?
39003015 But now we call the arrogant blessed. Certainly evildoers prosper, and even when they put God to the test, they get away with it.’ ”
39003016 Then those who feared the Lord talked with each other, and the Lord listened and heard. A scroll of remembrance was written in his presence concerning those who feared the Lord and honored his name.
39003017 “On the day when I act,” says the Lord Almighty, “they will be my treasured possession. I will spare them, just as a father has compassion and spares his son who serves him.
39003018 And you will again see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not.
39004001 “Surely the day is coming; it will burn like a furnace. All the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble, and the day that is coming will set them on fire,” says the Lord Almighty. “Not a root or a branch will be left to them.
39004002 But for you who revere my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its rays. And you will go out and frolic like well-fed calves.
39004003 Then you will trample on the wicked; they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day when I act,” says the Lord Almighty.
39004004 “Remember the law of my servant Moses, the decrees and laws I gave him at Horeb for all Israel.
39004005 “See, I will send the prophet Elijah to you before that great and dreadful day of the Lord comes.
39004006 He will turn the hearts of the parents to their children, and the hearts of the children to their parents; or else I will come and strike the land with total destruction.”
40001001 This is the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah the son of David, the son of Abraham:
40001002 Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,
40001003 Judah the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram,
40001004 Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon,
40001005 Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth, Obed the father of Jesse,
40001006 and Jesse the father of King David. David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah’s wife,
40001007 Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa,
40001008 Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Jehoram, Jehoram the father of Uzziah,
40001009 Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,
40001010 Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah,
40001011 and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.
40001012 After the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,
40001013 Zerubbabel the father of Abihud, Abihud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor,
40001014 Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Akim, Akim the father of Elihud,
40001015 Elihud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob,
40001016 and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, and Mary was the mother of Jesus who is called the Messiah.
40001017 Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Messiah.
40001018 This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about : His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.
40001019 Because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law, and yet did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.
40001020 But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
40001021 She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”
40001022 All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:
40001023 “The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel” (which means “God with us”).
40001024 When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife.
40001025 But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.
40002001 After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem
40002002 and asked, “Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.”
40002003 When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
40002004 When he had called together all the people’s chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Messiah was to be born.
40002005 “In Bethlehem in Judea,” they replied, “for this is what the prophet has written:
40002006 “ ‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.’ ”
40002007 Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
40002008 He sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.”
40002009 After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
40002010 When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.
40002011 On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.
40002012 And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.
40002013 When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up,” he said, “take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.”
40002014 So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt,
40002015 where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called my son.”
40002016 When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.
40002017 Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:
40002018 “A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.”
40002019 After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
40002020 and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child’s life are dead.”
40002021 So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.
40002022 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,
40002023 and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.
40003001 In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea
40003002 and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.”
40003003 This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah: “A voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’ ”
40003004 John’s clothes were made of camel’s hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
40003005 People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan.
40003006 Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
40003007 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them: “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
40003008 Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.
40003009 And do not think you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
40003010 The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
40003011 “I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
40003012 His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
40003013 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
40003014 But John tried to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”
40003015 Jesus replied, “Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John consented.
40003016 As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.
40003017 And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”
40004001 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
40004002 After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.
40004003 The tempter came to him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.”
40004004 Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’ ”
40004005 Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.
40004006 “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down. For it is written: “ ‘He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’ ”
40004007 Jesus answered him, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’ ”
40004008 Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.
40004009 “All this I will give you,” he said, “if you will bow down and worship me.”
40004010 Jesus said to him, “Away from me, Satan! For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.’ ”
40004011 Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.
40004012 When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee.
40004013 Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali—
40004014 to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah:
40004015 “Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—
40004016 the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.”
40004017 From that time on Jesus began to preach, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.”
40004018 As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
40004019 “Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for people.”
40004020 At once they left their nets and followed him.
40004021 Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them,
40004022 and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.
40004023 Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
40004024 News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed; and he healed them.
40004025 Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and the region across the Jordan followed him.
40005001 Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him,
40005002 and he began to teach them. He said:
40005003 “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
40005004 Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
40005005 Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
40005006 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
40005007 Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
40005008 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
40005009 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
40005010 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
40005011 “Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.
40005012 Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
40005013 “You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
40005014 “You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.
40005015 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
40005016 In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.
40005017 “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
40005018 For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.
40005019 Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
40005020 For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.
40005021 “You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘You shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’
40005022 But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca,’ is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell.
40005023 “Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you,
40005024 leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift.
40005025 “Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still together on the way, or your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison.
40005026 Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.
40005027 “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’
40005028 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
40005029 If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
40005030 And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.
40005031 “It has been said, ‘Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.’
40005032 But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
40005033 “Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.’
40005034 But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is God’s throne;
40005035 or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King.
40005036 And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.
40005037 All you need to say is simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.
40005038 “You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’
40005039 But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.
40005040 And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well.
40005041 If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles.
40005042 Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.
40005043 “You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’
40005044 But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
40005045 that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
40005046 If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that?
40005047 And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that?
40005048 Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
40006001 “Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
40006002 “So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
40006003 But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
40006004 so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
40006005 “And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
40006006 But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
40006007 And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.
40006008 Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
40006009 “This, then, is how you should pray: “ ‘Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,
40006010 your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
40006011 Give us today our daily bread.
40006012 And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
40006013 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. ’
40006014 For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
40006015 But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.
40006016 “When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
40006017 But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,
40006018 so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
40006019 “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
40006020 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
40006021 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
40006022 “The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
40006023 But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
40006024 “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.
40006025 “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?
40006026 Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
40006027 Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life ?
40006028 “And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin.
40006029 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.
40006030 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith?
40006031 So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’
40006032 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.
40006033 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
40006034 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
40007001 “Do not judge, or you too will be judged.
40007002 For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
40007003 “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?
40007004 How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye?
40007005 You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.
40007006 “Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.
40007007 “Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.
40007008 For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.
40007009 “Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
40007010 Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?
40007011 If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!
40007012 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.
40007013 “Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.
40007014 But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.
40007015 “Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.
40007016 By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?
40007017 Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
40007018 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
40007019 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
40007020 Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.
40007021 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
40007022 Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’
40007023 Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’
40007024 “Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
40007025 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.
40007026 But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
40007027 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.”
40007028 When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching,
40007029 because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.
40008001 When Jesus came down from the mountainside, large crowds followed him.
40008002 A man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”
40008003 Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!” Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy.
40008004 Then Jesus said to him, “See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”
40008005 When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help.
40008006 “Lord,” he said, “my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly.”
40008007 Jesus said to him, “Shall I come and heal him?”
40008008 The centurion replied, “Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
40008009 For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
40008010 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, “Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.
40008011 I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
40008012 But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
40008013 Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would.” And his servant was healed at that moment.
40008014 When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
40008015 He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him.
40008016 When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
40008017 This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: “He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases.”
40008018 When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake.
40008019 Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”
40008020 Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”
40008021 Another disciple said to him, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”
40008022 But Jesus told him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”
40008023 Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him.
40008024 Suddenly a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
40008025 The disciples went and woke him, saying, “Lord, save us! We’re going to drown!”
40008026 He replied, “You of little faith, why are you so afraid?” Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.
40008027 The men were amazed and asked, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!”
40008028 When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.
40008029 “What do you want with us, Son of God?” they shouted. “Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?”
40008030 Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding.
40008031 The demons begged Jesus, “If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.”
40008032 He said to them, “Go!” So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water.
40008033 Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town and reported all this, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.
40008034 Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region.
40009001 Jesus stepped into a boat, crossed over and came to his own town.
40009002 Some men brought to him a paralyzed man, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, “Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven.”
40009003 At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, “This fellow is blaspheming!”
40009004 Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, “Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?
40009005 Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?
40009006 But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” So he said to the paralyzed man, “Get up, take your mat and go home.”
40009007 Then the man got up and went home.
40009008 When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe; and they praised God, who had given such authority to man.
40009009 As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him.
40009010 While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples.
40009011 When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
40009012 On hearing this, Jesus said, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
40009013 But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”
40009014 Then John’s disciples came and asked him, “How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?”
40009015 Jesus answered, “How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.
40009016 “No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse.
40009017 Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.”
40009018 While he was saying this, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him and said, “My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live.”
40009019 Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples.
40009020 Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.
40009021 She said to herself, “If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed.”
40009022 Jesus turned and saw her. “Take heart, daughter,” he said, “your faith has healed you.” And the woman was healed at that moment.
40009023 When Jesus entered the synagogue leader’s house and saw the noisy crowd and people playing pipes,
40009024 he said, “Go away. The girl is not dead but asleep.” But they laughed at him.
40009025 After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up.
40009026 News of this spread through all that region.
40009027 As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”
40009028 When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” “Yes, Lord,” they replied.
40009029 Then he touched their eyes and said, “According to your faith let it be done to you”;
40009030 and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly, “See that no one knows about this.”
40009031 But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region.
40009032 While they were going out, a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus.
40009033 And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.”
40009034 But the Pharisees said, “It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons.”
40009035 Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness.
40009036 When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
40009037 Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few.
40009038 Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.”
40010001 Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
40010002 These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
40010003 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
40010004 Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
40010005 These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: “Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.
40010006 Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel.
40010007 As you go, proclaim this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near.’
40010008 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.
40010009 “Do not get any gold or silver or copper to take with you in your belts—
40010010 no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff, for the worker is worth his keep.
40010011 Whatever town or village you enter, search there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave.
40010012 As you enter the home, give it your greeting.
40010013 If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you.
40010014 If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet.
40010015 Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.
40010016 “I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.
40010017 Be on your guard; you will be handed over to the local councils and be flogged in the synagogues.
40010018 On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.
40010019 But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say,
40010020 for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
40010021 “Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.
40010022 You will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.
40010023 When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
40010024 “The student is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master.
40010025 It is enough for students to be like their teachers, and servants like their masters. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household!
40010026 “So do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.
40010027 What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs.
40010028 Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
40010029 Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father’s care.
40010030 And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
40010031 So don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
40010032 “Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.
40010033 But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven.
40010034 “Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
40010035 For I have come to turn “ ‘a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law—
40010036 a man’s enemies will be the members of his own household.’
40010037 “Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
40010038 Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
40010039 Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.
40010040 “Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
40010041 Whoever welcomes a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person’s reward.
40010042 And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who is my disciple, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not lose their reward.”
40011001 After Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
40011002 When John, who was in prison, heard about the deeds of the Messiah, he sent his disciples
40011003 to ask him, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?”
40011004 Jesus replied, “Go back and report to John what you hear and see:
40011005 The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.
40011006 Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.”
40011007 As John’s disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?
40011008 If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in kings’ palaces.
40011009 Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
40011010 This is the one about whom it is written: “ ‘I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.’
40011011 Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
40011012 From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence, and violent people have been raiding it.
40011013 For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
40011014 And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.
40011015 Whoever has ears, let them hear.
40011016 “To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others:
40011017 “ ‘We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.’
40011018 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’
40011019 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’ But wisdom is proved right by her deeds.”
40011020 Then Jesus began to denounce the towns in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent.
40011021 “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
40011022 But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
40011023 And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.
40011024 But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.”
40011025 At that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.
40011026 Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do.
40011027 “All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
40011028 “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
40011029 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
40011030 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”
40012001 At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.
40012002 When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.”
40012003 He answered, “Haven’t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
40012004 He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread—which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests.
40012005 Or haven’t you read in the Law that the priests on Sabbath duty in the temple desecrate the Sabbath and yet are innocent?
40012006 I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.
40012007 If you had known what these words mean, ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the innocent.
40012008 For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”
40012009 Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue,
40012010 and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to bring charges against Jesus, they asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”
40012011 He said to them, “If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?
40012012 How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”
40012013 Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other.
40012014 But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.
40012015 Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed all who were ill.
40012016 He warned them not to tell others about him.
40012017 This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
40012018 “Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
40012019 He will not quarrel or cry out; no one will hear his voice in the streets.
40012020 A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till he has brought justice through to victory.
40012021 In his name the nations will put their hope.”
40012022 Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see.
40012023 All the people were astonished and said, “Could this be the Son of David?”
40012024 But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.”
40012025 Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.
40012026 If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
40012027 And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.
40012028 But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
40012029 “Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man’s house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.
40012030 “Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.
40012031 And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
40012032 Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.
40012033 “Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit.
40012034 You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.
40012035 A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him.
40012036 But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.
40012037 For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.”
40012038 Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.”
40012039 He answered, “A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
40012040 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
40012041 The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here.
40012042 The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon’s wisdom, and now something greater than Solomon is here.
40012043 “When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.
40012044 Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’ When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean and put in order.
40012045 Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation.”
40012046 While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
40012047 Someone told him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.”
40012048 He replied to him, “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”
40012049 Pointing to his disciples, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers.
40012050 For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.”
40013001 That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake.
40013002 Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore.
40013003 Then he told them many things in parables, saying: “A farmer went out to sow his seed.
40013004 As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.
40013005 Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.
40013006 But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.
40013007 Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.
40013008 Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.
40013009 Whoever has ears, let them hear.”
40013010 The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?”
40013011 He replied, “Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.
40013012 Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.
40013013 This is why I speak to them in parables: “Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand.
40013014 In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: “ ‘You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.
40013015 For this people’s heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.’
40013016 But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
40013017 For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.
40013018 “Listen then to what the parable of the sower means:
40013019 When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path.
40013020 The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.
40013021 But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.
40013022 The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful.
40013023 But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.”
40013024 Jesus told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
40013025 But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.
40013026 When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.
40013027 “The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’
40013028 “ ‘An enemy did this,’ he replied. “The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’
40013029 “ ‘No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them.
40013030 Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’ ”
40013031 He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.
40013032 Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.”
40013033 He told them still another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough.”
40013034 Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable.
40013035 So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: “I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.”
40013036 Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”
40013037 He answered, “The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.
40013038 The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one,
40013039 and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.
40013040 “As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age.
40013041 The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.
40013042 They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40013043 Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear.
40013044 “The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.
40013045 “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.
40013046 When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.
40013047 “Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish.
40013048 When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away.
40013049 This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous
40013050 and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40013051 “Have you understood all these things?” Jesus asked. “Yes,” they replied.
40013052 He said to them, “Therefore every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.”
40013053 When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there.
40013054 Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. “Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?” they asked.
40013055 “Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother’s name Mary, and aren’t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas?
40013056 Aren’t all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?”
40013057 And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home.”
40013058 And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.
40014001 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus,
40014002 and he said to his attendants, “This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”
40014003 Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife,
40014004 for John had been saying to him: “It is not lawful for you to have her.”
40014005 Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, because they considered John a prophet.
40014006 On Herod’s birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for the guests and pleased Herod so much
40014007 that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.
40014008 Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.”
40014009 The king was distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he ordered that her request be granted
40014010 and had John beheaded in the prison.
40014011 His head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl, who carried it to her mother.
40014012 John’s disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.
40014013 When Jesus heard what had happened, he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. Hearing of this, the crowds followed him on foot from the towns.
40014014 When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
40014015 As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, “This is a remote place, and it’s already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.”
40014016 Jesus replied, “They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.”
40014017 “We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered.
40014018 “Bring them here to me,” he said.
40014019 And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
40014020 They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
40014021 The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and children.
40014022 Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd.
40014023 After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone,
40014024 and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.
40014025 Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake.
40014026 When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,” they said, and cried out in fear.
40014027 But Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”
40014028 “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.”
40014029 “Come,” he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus.
40014030 But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!”
40014031 Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little faith,” he said, “why did you doubt?”
40014032 And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down.
40014033 Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”
40014034 When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret.
40014035 And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding country. People brought all their sick to him
40014036 and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.
40015001 Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked,
40015002 “Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don’t wash their hands before they eat!”
40015003 Jesus replied, “And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?
40015004 For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’ and ‘Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.’
40015005 But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is ‘devoted to God,’
40015006 they are not to ‘honor their father or mother’ with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.
40015007 You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:
40015008 “ ‘These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
40015009 They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.’ ”
40015010 Jesus called the crowd to him and said, “Listen and understand.
40015011 What goes into someone’s mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them.”
40015012 Then the disciples came to him and asked, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?”
40015013 He replied, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots.
40015014 Leave them; they are blind guides. If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.”
40015015 Peter said, “Explain the parable to us.”
40015016 “Are you still so dull?” Jesus asked them.
40015017 “Don’t you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body?
40015018 But the things that come out of a person’s mouth come from the heart, and these defile them.
40015019 For out of the heart come evil thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.
40015020 These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them.”
40015021 Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
40015022 A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly.”
40015023 Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.”
40015024 He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.”
40015025 The woman came and knelt before him. “Lord, help me!” she said.
40015026 He replied, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”
40015027 “Yes it is, Lord,” she said. “Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.”
40015028 Then Jesus said to her, “Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.” And her daughter was healed at that moment.
40015029 Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down.
40015030 Great crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them.
40015031 The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel.
40015032 Jesus called his disciples to him and said, “I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way.”
40015033 His disciples answered, “Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?”
40015034 “How many loaves do you have?” Jesus asked. “Seven,” they replied, “and a few small fish.”
40015035 He told the crowd to sit down on the ground.
40015036 Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people.
40015037 They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
40015038 The number of those who ate was four thousand men, besides women and children.
40015039 After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan.
40016001 The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven.
40016002 He replied, “When evening comes, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red,’
40016003 and in the morning, ‘Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.’ You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.
40016004 A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.” Jesus then left them and went away.
40016005 When they went across the lake, the disciples forgot to take bread.
40016006 “Be careful,” Jesus said to them. “Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
40016007 They discussed this among themselves and said, “It is because we didn’t bring any bread.”
40016008 Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, “You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?
40016009 Do you still not understand? Don’t you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?
40016010 Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?
40016011 How is it you don’t understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
40016012 Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
40016013 When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say the Son of Man is?”
40016014 They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
40016015 “But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?”
40016016 Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”
40016017 Jesus replied, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.
40016018 And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
40016019 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”
40016020 Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.
40016021 From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.
40016022 Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. “Never, Lord!” he said. “This shall never happen to you!”
40016023 Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.”
40016024 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.
40016025 For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it.
40016026 What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
40016027 For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father’s glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.
40016028 “Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”
40017001 After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
40017002 There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.
40017003 Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.
40017004 Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.”
40017005 While he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!”
40017006 When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground, terrified.
40017007 But Jesus came and touched them. “Get up,” he said. “Don’t be afraid.”
40017008 When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.
40017009 As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, “Don’t tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”
40017010 The disciples asked him, “Why then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?”
40017011 Jesus replied, “To be sure, Elijah comes and will restore all things.
40017012 But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.”
40017013 Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist.
40017014 When they came to the crowd, a man approached Jesus and knelt before him.
40017015 “Lord, have mercy on my son,” he said. “He has seizures and is suffering greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
40017016 I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.”
40017017 “You unbelieving and perverse generation,” Jesus replied, “how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.”
40017018 Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed at that moment.
40017019 Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?”
40017020 He replied, “Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.”
40017021 
40017022 When they came together in Galilee, he said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.
40017023 They will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised to life.” And the disciples were filled with grief.
40017024 After Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma temple tax came to Peter and asked, “Doesn’t your teacher pay the temple tax?”
40017025 “Yes, he does,” he replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus was the first to speak. “What do you think, Simon?” he asked. “From whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes—from their own children or from others?”
40017026 “From others,” Peter answered. “Then the children are exempt,” Jesus said to him.
40017027 “But so that we may not cause offense, go to the lake and throw out your line. Take the first fish you catch; open its mouth and you will find a four-drachma coin. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours.”
40018001 At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who, then, is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”
40018002 He called a little child to him, and placed the child among them.
40018003 And he said: “Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
40018004 Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
40018005 And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.
40018006 “If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
40018007 Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble! Such things must come, but woe to the person through whom they come!
40018008 If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.
40018009 And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.
40018010 “See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.
40018011 
40018012 “What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off?
40018013 And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off.
40018014 In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish.
40018015 “If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over.
40018016 But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that ‘every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.’
40018017 If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
40018018 “Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
40018019 “Again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
40018020 For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.”
40018021 Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?”
40018022 Jesus answered, “I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.
40018023 “Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
40018024 As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was brought to him.
40018025 Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.
40018026 “At this the servant fell on his knees before him. ‘Be patient with me,’ he begged, ‘and I will pay back everything.’
40018027 The servant’s master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go.
40018028 “But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. He grabbed him and began to choke him. ‘Pay back what you owe me!’ he demanded.
40018029 “His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.’
40018030 “But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt.
40018031 When the other servants saw what had happened, they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened.
40018032 “Then the master called the servant in. ‘You wicked servant,’ he said, ‘I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to.
40018033 Shouldn’t you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?’
40018034 In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed.
40018035 “This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.”
40019001 When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan.
40019002 Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
40019003 Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?”
40019004 “Haven’t you read,” he replied, “that at the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’
40019005 and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’ ?
40019006 So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”
40019007 “Why then,” they asked, “did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?”
40019008 Jesus replied, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.
40019009 I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.”
40019010 The disciples said to him, “If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry.”
40019011 Jesus replied, “Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given.
40019012 For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others—and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.”
40019013 Then people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked them.
40019014 Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”
40019015 When he had placed his hands on them, he went on from there.
40019016 Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?”
40019017 “Why do you ask me about what is good?” Jesus replied. “There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.”
40019018 “Which ones?” he inquired. Jesus replied, “ ‘You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony,
40019019 honor your father and mother,’ and ‘love your neighbor as yourself.’ ”
40019020 “All these I have kept,” the young man said. “What do I still lack?”
40019021 Jesus answered, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”
40019022 When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.
40019023 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.
40019024 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”
40019025 When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved?”
40019026 Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”
40019027 Peter answered him, “We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?”
40019028 Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
40019029 And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
40019030 But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
40020001 “For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
40020002 He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard.
40020003 “About nine in the morning he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing.
40020004 He told them, ‘You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.’
40020005 So they went. “He went out again about noon and about three in the afternoon and did the same thing.
40020006 About five in the afternoon he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, ‘Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?’
40020007 “ ‘Because no one has hired us,’ they answered. “He said to them, ‘You also go and work in my vineyard.’
40020008 “When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.’
40020009 “The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius.
40020010 So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius.
40020011 When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner.
40020012 ‘These who were hired last worked only one hour,’ they said, ‘and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.’
40020013 “But he answered one of them, ‘I am not being unfair to you, friend. Didn’t you agree to work for a denarius?
40020014 Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you.
40020015 Don’t I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?’
40020016 “So the last will be first, and the first will be last.”
40020017 Now Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the Twelve aside and said to them,
40020018 “We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death
40020019 and will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. On the third day he will be raised to life!”
40020020 Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling down, asked a favor of him.
40020021 “What is it you want?” he asked. She said, “Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom.”
40020022 “You don’t know what you are asking,” Jesus said to them. “Can you drink the cup I am going to drink?” “We can,” they answered.
40020023 Jesus said to them, “You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father.”
40020024 When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers.
40020025 Jesus called them together and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.
40020026 Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
40020027 and whoever wants to be first must be your slave—
40020028 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”
40020029 As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
40020030 Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was going by, they shouted, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”
40020031 The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the louder, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”
40020032 Jesus stopped and called them. “What do you want me to do for you?” he asked.
40020033 “Lord,” they answered, “we want our sight.”
40020034 Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him.
40021001 As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
40021002 saying to them, “Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me.
40021003 If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away.”
40021004 This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet:
40021005 “Say to Daughter Zion, ‘See, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’ ”
40021006 The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.
40021007 They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks on them for Jesus to sit on.
40021008 A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
40021009 The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!” “Hosanna in the highest heaven!”
40021010 When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, “Who is this?”
40021011 The crowds answered, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.”
40021012 Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
40021013 “It is written,” he said to them, “ ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but you are making it ‘a den of robbers.’ ”
40021014 The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them.
40021015 But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple courts, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they were indignant.
40021016 “Do you hear what these children are saying?” they asked him. “Yes,” replied Jesus, “have you never read, “ ‘From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise’ ?”
40021017 And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.
40021018 Early in the morning, as Jesus was on his way back to the city, he was hungry.
40021019 Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, “May you never bear fruit again!” Immediately the tree withered.
40021020 When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?” they asked.
40021021 Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done.
40021022 If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.”
40021023 Jesus entered the temple courts, and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. “By what authority are you doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave you this authority?”
40021024 Jesus replied, “I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
40021025 John’s baptism—where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or of human origin?” They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’
40021026 But if we say, ‘Of human origin’—we are afraid of the people, for they all hold that John was a prophet.”
40021027 So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” Then he said, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
40021028 “What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work today in the vineyard.’
40021029 “ ‘I will not,’ he answered, but later he changed his mind and went.
40021030 “Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, ‘I will, sir,’ but he did not go.
40021031 “Which of the two did what his father wanted?” “The first,” they answered. Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you.
40021032 For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.
40021033 “Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place.
40021034 When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.
40021035 “The tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.
40021036 Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way.
40021037 Last of all, he sent his son to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said.
40021038 “But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him and take his inheritance.’
40021039 So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
40021040 “Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?”
40021041 “He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,” they replied, “and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.”
40021042 Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures: “ ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes’ ?
40021043 “Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.
40021044 Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.”
40021045 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus’ parables, they knew he was talking about them.
40021046 They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet.
40022001 Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:
40022002 “The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
40022003 He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come.
40022004 “Then he sent some more servants and said, ‘Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’
40022005 “But they paid no attention and went off—one to his field, another to his business.
40022006 The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them.
40022007 The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.
40022008 “Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come.
40022009 So go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.’
40022010 So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, the bad as well as the good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.
40022011 “But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
40022012 He asked, ‘How did you get in here without wedding clothes, friend?’ The man was speechless.
40022013 “Then the king told the attendants, ‘Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
40022014 “For many are invited, but few are chosen.”
40022015 Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words.
40022016 They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. “Teacher,” they said, “we know that you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren’t swayed by others, because you pay no attention to who they are.
40022017 Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay the imperial tax to Caesar or not?”
40022018 But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, “You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?
40022019 Show me the coin used for paying the tax.” They brought him a denarius,
40022020 and he asked them, “Whose image is this? And whose inscription?”
40022021 “Caesar’s,” they replied. Then he said to them, “So give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”
40022022 When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away.
40022023 That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.
40022024 “Teacher,” they said, “Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for him.
40022025 Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
40022026 The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh.
40022027 Finally, the woman died.
40022028 Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?”
40022029 Jesus replied, “You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.
40022030 At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.
40022031 But about the resurrection of the dead—have you not read what God said to you,
40022032 ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’ ? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.”
40022033 When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.
40022034 Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together.
40022035 One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question:
40022036 “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”
40022037 Jesus replied: “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’
40022038 This is the first and greatest commandment.
40022039 And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’
40022040 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”
40022041 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
40022042 “What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?” “The son of David,” they replied.
40022043 He said to them, “How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him ‘Lord’? For he says,
40022044 “ ‘The Lord said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.” ’
40022045 If then David calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son?”
40022046 No one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions.
40023001 Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples:
40023002 “The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat.
40023003 So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.
40023004 They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.
40023005 “Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long;
40023006 they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues;
40023007 they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by others.
40023008 “But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
40023009 And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.
40023010 Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah.
40023011 The greatest among you will be your servant.
40023012 For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.
40023013 “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.
40023014 
40023015 “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.
40023016 “Woe to you, blind guides! You say, ‘If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gold of the temple is bound by that oath.’
40023017 You blind fools! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred?
40023018 You also say, ‘If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gift on the altar is bound by that oath.’
40023019 You blind men! Which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred?
40023020 Therefore, anyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
40023021 And anyone who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.
40023022 And anyone who swears by heaven swears by God’s throne and by the one who sits on it.
40023023 “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.
40023024 You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.
40023025 “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
40023026 Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.
40023027 “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean.
40023028 In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.
40023029 “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
40023030 And you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’
40023031 So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.
40023032 Go ahead, then, and complete what your ancestors started!
40023033 “You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell?
40023034 Therefore I am sending you prophets and sages and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town.
40023035 And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
40023036 Truly I tell you, all this will come on this generation.
40023037 “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing.
40023038 Look, your house is left to you desolate.
40023039 For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.’ ”
40024001 Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings.
40024002 “Do you see all these things?” he asked. “Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.”
40024003 As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”
40024004 Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you.
40024005 For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many.
40024006 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.
40024007 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
40024008 All these are the beginning of birth pains.
40024009 “Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.
40024010 At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other,
40024011 and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.
40024012 Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold,
40024013 but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.
40024014 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
40024015 “So when you see standing in the holy place ‘the abomination that causes desolation,’ spoken of through the prophet Daniel—let the reader understand—
40024016 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
40024017 Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out of the house.
40024018 Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak.
40024019 How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!
40024020 Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath.
40024021 For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again.
40024022 “If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened.
40024023 At that time if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Messiah!’ or, ‘There he is!’ do not believe it.
40024024 For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
40024025 See, I have told you ahead of time.
40024026 “So if anyone tells you, ‘There he is, out in the wilderness,’ do not go out; or, ‘Here he is, in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it.
40024027 For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
40024028 Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.
40024029 “Immediately after the distress of those days “ ‘the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’
40024030 “Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory.
40024031 And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.
40024032 “Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
40024033 Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door.
40024034 Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
40024035 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
40024036 “But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
40024037 As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
40024038 For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark;
40024039 and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
40024040 Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left.
40024041 Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left.
40024042 “Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.
40024043 But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into.
40024044 So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.
40024045 “Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time?
40024046 It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns.
40024047 Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
40024048 But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, ‘My master is staying away a long time,’
40024049 and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards.
40024050 The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of.
40024051 He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40025001 “At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
40025002 Five of them were foolish and five were wise.
40025003 The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them.
40025004 The wise ones, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps.
40025005 The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
40025006 “At midnight the cry rang out: ‘Here’s the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’
40025007 “Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps.
40025008 The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’
40025009 “ ‘No,’ they replied, ‘there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’
40025010 “But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut.
40025011 “Later the others also came. ‘Lord, Lord,’ they said, ‘open the door for us!’
40025012 “But he replied, ‘Truly I tell you, I don’t know you.’
40025013 “Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.
40025014 “Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them.
40025015 To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.
40025016 The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more.
40025017 So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more.
40025018 But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money.
40025019 “After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.
40025020 The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.’
40025021 “His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’
40025022 “The man with two bags of gold also came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.’
40025023 “His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’
40025024 “Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed.
40025025 So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.’
40025026 “His master replied, ‘You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed?
40025027 Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.
40025028 “ ‘So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags.
40025029 For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.
40025030 And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
40025031 “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne.
40025032 All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
40025033 He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
40025034 “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.
40025035 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in,
40025036 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’
40025037 “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?
40025038 When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you?
40025039 When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’
40025040 “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’
40025041 “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
40025042 For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink,
40025043 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’
40025044 “They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’
40025045 “He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’
40025046 “Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.”
40026001 When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,
40026002 “As you know, the Passover is two days away—and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.”
40026003 Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas,
40026004 and they schemed to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him.
40026005 “But not during the festival,” they said, “or there may be a riot among the people.”
40026006 While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of Simon the Leper,
40026007 a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table.
40026008 When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. “Why this waste?” they asked.
40026009 “This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor.”
40026010 Aware of this, Jesus said to them, “Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me.
40026011 The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me.
40026012 When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.
40026013 Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.”
40026014 Then one of the Twelve—the one called Judas Iscariot—went to the chief priests
40026015 and asked, “What are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?” So they counted out for him thirty pieces of silver.
40026016 From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over.
40026017 On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?”
40026018 He replied, “Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, ‘The Teacher says: My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.’ ”
40026019 So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
40026020 When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve.
40026021 And while they were eating, he said, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me.”
40026022 They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, “Surely you don’t mean me, Lord?”
40026023 Jesus replied, “The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.
40026024 The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.”
40026025 Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, “Surely you don’t mean me, Rabbi?” Jesus answered, “You have said so.”
40026026 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take and eat; this is my body.”
40026027 Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you.
40026028 This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
40026029 I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.”
40026030 When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
40026031 Then Jesus told them, “This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: “ ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’
40026032 But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”
40026033 Peter replied, “Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will.”
40026034 “Truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.”
40026035 But Peter declared, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.” And all the other disciples said the same.
40026036 Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”
40026037 He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
40026038 Then he said to them, “My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.”
40026039 Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.”
40026040 Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. “Couldn’t you men keep watch with me for one hour?” he asked Peter.
40026041 “Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”
40026042 He went away a second time and prayed, “My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.”
40026043 When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy.
40026044 So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.
40026045 Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.
40026046 Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!”
40026047 While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
40026048 Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The one I kiss is the man; arrest him.”
40026049 Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him.
40026050 Jesus replied, “Do what you came for, friend.” Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him.
40026051 With that, one of Jesus’ companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
40026052 “Put your sword back in its place,” Jesus said to him, “for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.
40026053 Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?
40026054 But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?”
40026055 In that hour Jesus said to the crowd, “Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me.
40026056 But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.
40026057 Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
40026058 But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.
40026059 The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
40026060 But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two came forward
40026061 and declared, “This fellow said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’ ”
40026062 Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?”
40026063 But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, “I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.”
40026064 “You have said so,” Jesus replied. “But I say to all of you: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.”
40026065 Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.
40026066 What do you think?” “He is worthy of death,” they answered.
40026067 Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him
40026068 and said, “Prophesy to us, Messiah. Who hit you?”
40026069 Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. “You also were with Jesus of Galilee,” she said.
40026070 But he denied it before them all. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said.
40026071 Then he went out to the gateway, where another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, “This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.”
40026072 He denied it again, with an oath: “I don’t know the man!”
40026073 After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, “Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away.”
40026074 Then he began to call down curses, and he swore to them, “I don’t know the man!” Immediately a rooster crowed.
40026075 Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: “Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.
40027001 Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people made their plans how to have Jesus executed.
40027002 So they bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate the governor.
40027003 When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
40027004 “I have sinned,” he said, “for I have betrayed innocent blood.” “What is that to us?” they replied. “That’s your responsibility.”
40027005 So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
40027006 The chief priests picked up the coins and said, “It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.”
40027007 So they decided to use the money to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for foreigners.
40027008 That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
40027009 Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel,
40027010 and they used them to buy the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”
40027011 Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus replied.
40027012 When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer.
40027013 Then Pilate asked him, “Don’t you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?”
40027014 But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge—to the great amazement of the governor.
40027015 Now it was the governor’s custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd.
40027016 At that time they had a well-known prisoner whose name was Jesus Barabbas.
40027017 So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, “Which one do you want me to release to you: Jesus Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?”
40027018 For he knew it was out of self-interest that they had handed Jesus over to him.
40027019 While Pilate was sitting on the judge’s seat, his wife sent him this message: “Don’t have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.”
40027020 But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.
40027021 “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” asked the governor. “Barabbas,” they answered.
40027022 “What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?” Pilate asked. They all answered, “Crucify him!”
40027023 “Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!”
40027024 When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,” he said. “It is your responsibility!”
40027025 All the people answered, “His blood is on us and on our children!”
40027026 Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.
40027027 Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.
40027028 They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,
40027029 and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him. “Hail, king of the Jews!” they said.
40027030 They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.
40027031 After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.
40027032 As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross.
40027033 They came to a place called Golgotha (which means “the place of the skull”).
40027034 There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.
40027035 When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots.
40027036 And sitting down, they kept watch over him there.
40027037 Above his head they placed the written charge against him: this is jesus, the king of the jews.
40027038 Two rebels were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
40027039 Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads
40027040 and saying, “You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!”
40027041 In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him.
40027042 “He saved others,” they said, “but he can’t save himself! He’s the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.
40027043 He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’ ”
40027044 In the same way the rebels who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.
40027045 From noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land.
40027046 About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lemasabachthani?” (which means “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”).
40027047 When some of those standing there heard this, they said, “He’s calling Elijah.”
40027048 Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
40027049 The rest said, “Now leave him alone. Let’s see if Elijah comes to save him.”
40027050 And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.
40027051 At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split
40027052 and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.
40027053 They came out of the tombs after Jesus’ resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people.
40027054 When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, “Surely he was the Son of God!”
40027055 Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
40027056 Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.
40027057 As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.
40027058 Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus’ body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
40027059 Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
40027060 and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.
40027061 Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.
40027062 The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
40027063 “Sir,” they said, “we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’
40027064 So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.”
40027065 “Take a guard,” Pilate answered. “Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.”
40027066 So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.
40028001 After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
40028002 There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it.
40028003 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.
40028004 The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.
40028005 The angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
40028006 He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.
40028007 Then go quickly and tell his disciples: ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.’ Now I have told you.”
40028008 So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
40028009 Suddenly Jesus met them. “Greetings,” he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him.
40028010 Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.”
40028011 While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
40028012 When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money,
40028013 telling them, “You are to say, ‘His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.’
40028014 If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”
40028015 So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.
40028016 Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
40028017 When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.
40028018 Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
40028019 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
40028020 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”
41001001 The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God,
41001002 as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way” —
41001003 “a voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’ ”
41001004 And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
41001005 The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
41001006 John wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
41001007 And this was his message: “After me comes the one more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.
41001008 I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”
41001009 At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
41001010 Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
41001011 And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.”
41001012 At once the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness,
41001013 and he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.
41001014 After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
41001015 “The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!”
41001016 As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
41001017 “Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for people.”
41001018 At once they left their nets and followed him.
41001019 When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.
41001020 Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.
41001021 They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.
41001022 The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.
41001023 Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out,
41001024 “What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”
41001025 “Be quiet!” said Jesus sternly. “Come out of him!”
41001026 The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.
41001027 The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, “What is this? A new teaching—and with authority! He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him.”
41001028 News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.
41001029 As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.
41001030 Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told Jesus about her.
41001031 So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.
41001032 That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.
41001033 The whole town gathered at the door,
41001034 and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.
41001035 Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.
41001036 Simon and his companions went to look for him,
41001037 and when they found him, they exclaimed: “Everyone is looking for you!”
41001038 Jesus replied, “Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.”
41001039 So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.
41001040 A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, “If you are willing, you can make me clean.”
41001041 Jesus was indignant. He reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!”
41001042 Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.
41001043 Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:
41001044 “See that you don’t tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”
41001045 Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.
41002001 A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home.
41002002 They gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them.
41002003 Some men came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, carried by four of them.
41002004 Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on.
41002005 When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”
41002006 Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,
41002007 “Why does this fellow talk like that? He’s blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
41002008 Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, “Why are you thinking these things?
41002009 Which is easier: to say to this paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat and walk’?
41002010 But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” So he said to the man,
41002011 “I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.”
41002012 He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”
41002013 Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.
41002014 As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
41002015 While Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.
41002016 When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
41002017 On hearing this, Jesus said to them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”
41002018 Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, “How is it that John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?”
41002019 Jesus answered, “How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them.
41002020 But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.
41002021 “No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.
41002022 And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins.”
41002023 One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.
41002024 The Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?”
41002025 He answered, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?
41002026 In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.”
41002027 Then he said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
41002028 So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”
41003001 Another time Jesus went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there.
41003002 Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.
41003003 Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, “Stand up in front of everyone.”
41003004 Then Jesus asked them, “Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” But they remained silent.
41003005 He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.
41003006 Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.
41003007 Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed.
41003008 When they heard about all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon.
41003009 Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him.
41003010 For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him.
41003011 Whenever the impure spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God.”
41003012 But he gave them strict orders not to tell others about him.
41003013 Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.
41003014 He appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach
41003015 and to have authority to drive out demons.
41003016 These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter),
41003017 James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means “sons of thunder”),
41003018 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot
41003019 and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
41003020 Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat.
41003021 When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, “He is out of his mind.”
41003022 And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons.”
41003023 So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables: “How can Satan drive out Satan?
41003024 If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
41003025 If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
41003026 And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.
41003027 In fact, no one can enter a strong man’s house without first tying him up. Then he can plunder the strong man’s house.
41003028 Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter,
41003029 but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin.”
41003030 He said this because they were saying, “He has an impure spirit.”
41003031 Then Jesus’ mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.
41003032 A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, “Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.”
41003033 “Who are my mother and my brothers?” he asked.
41003034 Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, “Here are my mother and my brothers!
41003035 Whoever does God’s will is my brother and sister and mother.”
41004001 Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water’s edge.
41004002 He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said:
41004003 “Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.
41004004 As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.
41004005 Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.
41004006 But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.
41004007 Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain.
41004008 Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, some multiplying thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times.”
41004009 Then Jesus said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”
41004010 When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables.
41004011 He told them, “The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables
41004012 so that, “ ‘they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!’ ”
41004013 Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?
41004014 The farmer sows the word.
41004015 Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.
41004016 Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy.
41004017 But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.
41004018 Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word;
41004019 but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.
41004020 Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop—some thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times what was sown.”
41004021 He said to them, “Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don’t you put it on its stand?
41004022 For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open.
41004023 If anyone has ears to hear, let them hear.”
41004024 “Consider carefully what you hear,” he continued. “With the measure you use, it will be measured to you—and even more.
41004025 Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.”
41004026 He also said, “This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground.
41004027 Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.
41004028 All by itself the soil produces grain—first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.
41004029 As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.”
41004030 Again he said, “What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it?
41004031 It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds on earth.
41004032 Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds can perch in its shade.”
41004033 With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand.
41004034 He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.
41004035 That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, “Let us go over to the other side.”
41004036 Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him.
41004037 A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped.
41004038 Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care if we drown?”
41004039 He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, “Quiet! Be still!” Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.
41004040 He said to his disciples, “Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?”
41004041 They were terrified and asked each other, “Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!”
41005001 They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.
41005002 When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs to meet him.
41005003 This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain.
41005004 For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.
41005005 Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.
41005006 When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.
41005007 He shouted at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God’s name don’t torture me!”
41005008 For Jesus had said to him, “Come out of this man, you impure spirit!”
41005009 Then Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” “My name is Legion,” he replied, “for we are many.”
41005010 And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.
41005011 A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.
41005012 The demons begged Jesus, “Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.”
41005013 He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.
41005014 Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.
41005015 When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
41005016 Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man—and told about the pigs as well.
41005017 Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.
41005018 As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.
41005019 Jesus did not let him, but said, “Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.”
41005020 So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.
41005021 When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.
41005022 Then one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet.
41005023 He pleaded earnestly with him, “My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.”
41005024 So Jesus went with him. A large crowd followed and pressed around him.
41005025 And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.
41005026 She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.
41005027 When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,
41005028 because she thought, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.”
41005029 Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.
41005030 At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my clothes?”
41005031 “You see the people crowding against you,” his disciples answered, “and yet you can ask, ‘Who touched me?’ ”
41005032 But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.
41005033 Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.
41005034 He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.”
41005035 While Jesus was still speaking, some people came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” they said. “Why bother the teacher anymore?”
41005036 Overhearing what they said, Jesus told him, “Don’t be afraid; just believe.”
41005037 He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James.
41005038 When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.
41005039 He went in and said to them, “Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep.”
41005040 But they laughed at him. After he put them all out, he took the child’s father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was.
41005041 He took her by the hand and said to her, “Talitha koum!” (which means “Little girl, I say to you, get up!”).
41005042 Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished.
41005043 He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.
41006001 Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples.
41006002 When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. “Where did this man get these things?” they asked. “What’s this wisdom that has been given him? What are these remarkable miracles he is performing?
41006003 Isn’t this the carpenter? Isn’t this Mary’s son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren’t his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him.
41006004 Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home.”
41006005 He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.
41006006 He was amazed at their lack of faith. Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village.
41006007 Calling the Twelve to him, he began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over impure spirits.
41006008 These were his instructions: “Take nothing for the journey except a staff—no bread, no bag, no money in your belts.
41006009 Wear sandals but not an extra shirt.
41006010 Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.
41006011 And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, leave that place and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”
41006012 They went out and preached that people should repent.
41006013 They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.
41006014 King Herod heard about this, for Jesus’ name had become well known. Some were saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”
41006015 Others said, “He is Elijah.” And still others claimed, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago.”
41006016 But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!”
41006017 For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, whom he had married.
41006018 For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”
41006019 So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to,
41006020 because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled ; yet he liked to listen to him.
41006021 Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.
41006022 When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, “Ask me for anything you want, and I’ll give it to you.”
41006023 And he promised her with an oath, “Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.”
41006024 She went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask for?” “The head of John the Baptist,” she answered.
41006025 At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”
41006026 The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.
41006027 So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John’s head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison,
41006028 and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.
41006029 On hearing of this, John’s disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.
41006030 The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught.
41006031 Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, “Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.”
41006032 So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.
41006033 But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.
41006034 When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.
41006035 By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. “This is a remote place,” they said, “and it’s already very late.
41006036 Send the people away so that they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”
41006037 But he answered, “You give them something to eat.” They said to him, “That would take more than half a year’s wages ! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?”
41006038 “How many loaves do you have?” he asked. “Go and see.” When they found out, they said, “Five—and two fish.”
41006039 Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.
41006040 So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.
41006041 Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.
41006042 They all ate and were satisfied,
41006043 and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish.
41006044 The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.
41006045 Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.
41006046 After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.
41006047 Later that night, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land.
41006048 He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. Shortly before dawn he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them,
41006049 but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out,
41006050 because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and said, “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”
41006051 Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed,
41006052 for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.
41006053 When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there.
41006054 As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus.
41006055 They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.
41006056 And wherever he went—into villages, towns or countryside—they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.
41007001 The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus
41007002 and saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed.
41007003 (The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders.
41007004 When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles. )
41007005 So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, “Why don’t your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with defiled hands?”
41007006 He replied, “Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: “ ‘These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
41007007 They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.’
41007008 You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions.”
41007009 And he continued, “You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!
41007010 For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and mother,’ and, ‘Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.’
41007011 But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is Corban (that is, devoted to God)—
41007012 then you no longer let them do anything for their father or mother.
41007013 Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.”
41007014 Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, “Listen to me, everyone, and understand this.
41007015 Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles them.”
41007016 
41007017 After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.
41007018 “Are you so dull?” he asked. “Don’t you see that nothing that enters a person from the outside can defile them?
41007019 For it doesn’t go into their heart but into their stomach, and then out of the body.” (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.)
41007020 He went on: “What comes out of a person is what defiles them.
41007021 For it is from within, out of a person’s heart, that evil thoughts come—sexual immorality, theft, murder,
41007022 adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.
41007023 All these evils come from inside and defile a person.”
41007024 Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret.
41007025 In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an impure spirit came and fell at his feet.
41007026 The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.
41007027 “First let the children eat all they want,” he told her, “for it is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”
41007028 “Lord,” she replied, “even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”
41007029 Then he told her, “For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter.”
41007030 She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.
41007031 Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.
41007032 There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him.
41007033 After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man’s ears. Then he spit and touched the man’s tongue.
41007034 He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, “Ephphatha!” (which means “Be opened!”).
41007035 At this, the man’s ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly.
41007036 Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it.
41007037 People were overwhelmed with amazement. “He has done everything well,” they said. “He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”
41008001 During those days another large crowd gathered. Since they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said,
41008002 “I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat.
41008003 If I send them home hungry, they will collapse on the way, because some of them have come a long distance.”
41008004 His disciples answered, “But where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them?”
41008005 “How many loaves do you have?” Jesus asked. “Seven,” they replied.
41008006 He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. When he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people, and they did so.
41008007 They had a few small fish as well; he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them.
41008008 The people ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
41008009 About four thousand were present. After he had sent them away,
41008010 he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.
41008011 The Pharisees came and began to question Jesus. To test him, they asked him for a sign from heaven.
41008012 He sighed deeply and said, “Why does this generation ask for a sign? Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to it.”
41008013 Then he left them, got back into the boat and crossed to the other side.
41008014 The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat.
41008015 “Be careful,” Jesus warned them. “Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod.”
41008016 They discussed this with one another and said, “It is because we have no bread.”
41008017 Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: “Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?
41008018 Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don’t you remember?
41008019 When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?” “Twelve,” they replied.
41008020 “And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?” They answered, “Seven.”
41008021 He said to them, “Do you still not understand?”
41008022 They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him.
41008023 He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man’s eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, “Do you see anything?”
41008024 He looked up and said, “I see people; they look like trees walking around.”
41008025 Once more Jesus put his hands on the man’s eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.
41008026 Jesus sent him home, saying, “Don’t even go into the village.”
41008027 Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, “Who do people say I am?”
41008028 They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.”
41008029 “But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?” Peter answered, “You are the Messiah.”
41008030 Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.
41008031 He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again.
41008032 He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
41008033 But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. “Get behind me, Satan!” he said. “You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.”
41008034 Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.
41008035 For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it.
41008036 What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?
41008037 Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
41008038 If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his Father’s glory with the holy angels.”
41009001 And he said to them, “Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see that the kingdom of God has come with power.”
41009002 After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high mountain, where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them.
41009003 His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them.
41009004 And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus.
41009005 Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.”
41009006 (He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.)
41009007 Then a cloud appeared and covered them, and a voice came from the cloud: “This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!”
41009008 Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.
41009009 As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
41009010 They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what “rising from the dead” meant.
41009011 And they asked him, “Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?”
41009012 Jesus replied, “To be sure, Elijah does come first, and restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected?
41009013 But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they have done to him everything they wished, just as it is written about him.”
41009014 When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them.
41009015 As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him.
41009016 “What are you arguing with them about?” he asked.
41009017 A man in the crowd answered, “Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech.
41009018 Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not.”
41009019 “You unbelieving generation,” Jesus replied, “how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.”
41009020 So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.
41009021 Jesus asked the boy’s father, “How long has he been like this?” “From childhood,” he answered.
41009022 “It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us.”
41009023 “ ‘If you can’?” said Jesus. “Everything is possible for one who believes.”
41009024 Immediately the boy’s father exclaimed, “I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!”
41009025 When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the impure spirit. “You deaf and mute spirit,” he said, “I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.”
41009026 The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, “He’s dead.”
41009027 But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up.
41009028 After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?”
41009029 He replied, “This kind can come out only by prayer. ”
41009030 They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were,
41009031 because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise.”
41009032 But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.
41009033 They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, “What were you arguing about on the road?”
41009034 But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest.
41009035 Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, “Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last, and the servant of all.”
41009036 He took a little child whom he placed among them. Taking the child in his arms, he said to them,
41009037 “Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me.”
41009038 “Teacher,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us.”
41009039 “Do not stop him,” Jesus said. “For no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me,
41009040 for whoever is not against us is for us.
41009041 Truly I tell you, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to the Messiah will certainly not lose their reward.
41009042 “If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them if a large millstone were hung around their neck and they were thrown into the sea.
41009043 If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out.
41009044 
41009045 And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.
41009046 
41009047 And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,
41009048 where “ ‘the worms that eat them do not die, and the fire is not quenched.’
41009049 Everyone will be salted with fire.
41009050 “Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty again? Have salt among yourselves, and be at peace with each other.”
41010001 Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them.
41010002 Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”
41010003 “What did Moses command you?” he replied.
41010004 They said, “Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.”
41010005 “It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law,” Jesus replied.
41010006 “But at the beginning of creation God ‘made them male and female.’
41010007 ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,
41010008 and the two will become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two, but one flesh.
41010009 Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”
41010010 When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this.
41010011 He answered, “Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.
41010012 And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.”
41010013 People were bringing little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them, but the disciples rebuked them.
41010014 When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
41010015 Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”
41010016 And he took the children in his arms, placed his hands on them and blessed them.
41010017 As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. “Good teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
41010018 “Why do you call me good?” Jesus answered. “No one is good—except God alone.
41010019 You know the commandments: ‘You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, you shall not defraud, honor your father and mother.’ ”
41010020 “Teacher,” he declared, “all these I have kept since I was a boy.”
41010021 Jesus looked at him and loved him. “One thing you lack,” he said. “Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”
41010022 At this the man’s face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.
41010023 Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!”
41010024 The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!
41010025 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”
41010026 The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, “Who then can be saved?”
41010027 Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.”
41010028 Then Peter spoke up, “We have left everything to follow you!”
41010029 “Truly I tell you,” Jesus replied, “no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel
41010030 will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age: homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields—along with persecutions—and in the age to come eternal life.
41010031 But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”
41010032 They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him.
41010033 “We are going up to Jerusalem,” he said, “and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles,
41010034 who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise.”
41010035 Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. “Teacher,” they said, “we want you to do for us whatever we ask.”
41010036 “What do you want me to do for you?” he asked.
41010037 They replied, “Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.”
41010038 “You don’t know what you are asking,” Jesus said. “Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?”
41010039 “We can,” they answered. Jesus said to them, “You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with,
41010040 but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared.”
41010041 When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John.
41010042 Jesus called them together and said, “You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.
41010043 Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
41010044 and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.
41010045 For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”
41010046 Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (which means “son of Timaeus”), was sitting by the roadside begging.
41010047 When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”
41010048 Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
41010049 Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” So they called to the blind man, “Cheer up! On your feet! He’s calling you.”
41010050 Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.
41010051 “What do you want me to do for you?” Jesus asked him. The blind man said, “Rabbi, I want to see.”
41010052 “Go,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you.” Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.
41011001 As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,
41011002 saying to them, “Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.
41011003 If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.’ ”
41011004 They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. As they untied it,
41011005 some people standing there asked, “What are you doing, untying that colt?”
41011006 They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go.
41011007 When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it.
41011008 Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields.
41011009 Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, “Hosanna! ” “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!”
41011010 “Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!” “Hosanna in the highest heaven!”
41011011 Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.
41011012 The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry.
41011013 Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs.
41011014 Then he said to the tree, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard him say it.
41011015 On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves,
41011016 and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.
41011017 And as he taught them, he said, “Is it not written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations’ ? But you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’ ”
41011018 The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.
41011019 When evening came, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city.
41011020 In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.
41011021 Peter remembered and said to Jesus, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!”
41011022 “Have faith in God,” Jesus answered.
41011023 “Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.
41011024 Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.
41011025 And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.”
41011026 
41011027 They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders came to him.
41011028 “By what authority are you doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave you authority to do this?”
41011029 Jesus replied, “I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
41011030 John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or of human origin? Tell me!”
41011031 They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’
41011032 But if we say, ‘Of human origin’ …” (They feared the people, for everyone held that John really was a prophet.)
41011033 So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” Jesus said, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”
41012001 Jesus then began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place.
41012002 At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.
41012003 But they seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
41012004 Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully.
41012005 He sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat, others they killed.
41012006 “He had one left to send, a son, whom he loved. He sent him last of all, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’
41012007 “But the tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’
41012008 So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.
41012009 “What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.
41012010 Haven’t you read this passage of Scripture: “ ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;
41012011 the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes’ ?”
41012012 Then the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd; so they left him and went away.
41012013 Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words.
41012014 They came to him and said, “Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity. You aren’t swayed by others, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay the imperial tax to Caesar or not?
41012015 Should we pay or shouldn’t we?” But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. “Why are you trying to trap me?” he asked. “Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.”
41012016 They brought the coin, and he asked them, “Whose image is this? And whose inscription?” “Caesar’s,” they replied.
41012017 Then Jesus said to them, “Give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s and to God what is God’s.” And they were amazed at him.
41012018 Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.
41012019 “Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.
41012020 Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children.
41012021 The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the same with the third.
41012022 In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too.
41012023 At the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?”
41012024 Jesus replied, “Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God?
41012025 When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.
41012026 Now about the dead rising—have you not read in the Book of Moses, in the account of the burning bush, how God said to him, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’ ?
41012027 He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!”
41012028 One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?”
41012029 “The most important one,” answered Jesus, “is this: ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.
41012030 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’
41012031 The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no commandment greater than these.”
41012032 “Well said, teacher,” the man replied. “You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.
41012033 To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.”
41012034 When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions.
41012035 While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, “Why do the teachers of the law say that the Messiah is the son of David?
41012036 David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: “ ‘The Lord said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.” ’
41012037 David himself calls him ‘Lord.’ How then can he be his son?” The large crowd listened to him with delight.
41012038 As he taught, Jesus said, “Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted with respect in the marketplaces,
41012039 and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.
41012040 They devour widows’ houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will be punished most severely.”
41012041 Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts.
41012042 But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents.
41012043 Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.
41012044 They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything—all she had to live on.”
41013001 As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!”
41013002 “Do you see all these great buildings?” replied Jesus. “Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.”
41013003 As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately,
41013004 “Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?”
41013005 Jesus said to them: “Watch out that no one deceives you.
41013006 Many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am he,’ and will deceive many.
41013007 When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.
41013008 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth pains.
41013009 “You must be on your guard. You will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues. On account of me you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them.
41013010 And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.
41013011 Whenever you are arrested and brought to trial, do not worry beforehand about what to say. Just say whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
41013012 “Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.
41013013 Everyone will hate you because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.
41013014 “When you see ‘the abomination that causes desolation’ standing where it does not belong—let the reader understand—then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
41013015 Let no one on the housetop go down or enter the house to take anything out.
41013016 Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak.
41013017 How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!
41013018 Pray that this will not take place in winter,
41013019 because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now—and never to be equaled again.
41013020 “If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them.
41013021 At that time if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Messiah!’ or, ‘Look, there he is!’ do not believe it.
41013022 For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
41013023 So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time.
41013024 “But in those days, following that distress, “ ‘the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light;
41013025 the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’
41013026 “At that time people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.
41013027 And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens.
41013028 “Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
41013029 Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, right at the door.
41013030 Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
41013031 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
41013032 “But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
41013033 Be on guard! Be alert ! You do not know when that time will come.
41013034 It’s like a man going away: He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with their assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch.
41013035 “Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back—whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn.
41013036 If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping.
41013037 What I say to you, I say to everyone: ‘Watch!’ ”
41014001 Now the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread were only two days away, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were scheming to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him.
41014002 “But not during the festival,” they said, “or the people may riot.”
41014003 While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.
41014004 Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, “Why this waste of perfume?
41014005 It could have been sold for more than a year’s wages and the money given to the poor.” And they rebuked her harshly.
41014006 “Leave her alone,” said Jesus. “Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.
41014007 The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me.
41014008 She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial.
41014009 Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.”
41014010 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them.
41014011 They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over.
41014012 On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus’ disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?”
41014013 So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, “Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.
41014014 Say to the owner of the house he enters, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’
41014015 He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.”
41014016 The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.
41014017 When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve.
41014018 While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me—one who is eating with me.”
41014019 They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, “Surely you don’t mean me?”
41014020 “It is one of the Twelve,” he replied, “one who dips bread into the bowl with me.
41014021 The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.”
41014022 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take it; this is my body.”
41014023 Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it.
41014024 “This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many,” he said to them.
41014025 “Truly I tell you, I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”
41014026 When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
41014027 “You will all fall away,” Jesus told them, “for it is written: “ ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’
41014028 But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”
41014029 Peter declared, “Even if all fall away, I will not.”
41014030 “Truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “today—yes, tonight—before the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times.”
41014031 But Peter insisted emphatically, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.” And all the others said the same.
41014032 They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, “Sit here while I pray.”
41014033 He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.
41014034 “My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death,” he said to them. “Stay here and keep watch.”
41014035 Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him.
41014036 “Abba, Father,” he said, “everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.”
41014037 Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. “Simon,” he said to Peter, “are you asleep? Couldn’t you keep watch for one hour?
41014038 Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”
41014039 Once more he went away and prayed the same thing.
41014040 When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him.
41014041 Returning the third time, he said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.
41014042 Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!”
41014043 Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders.
41014044 Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard.”
41014045 Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, “Rabbi!” and kissed him.
41014046 The men seized Jesus and arrested him.
41014047 Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
41014048 “Am I leading a rebellion,” said Jesus, “that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?
41014049 Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.”
41014050 Then everyone deserted him and fled.
41014051 A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him,
41014052 he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.
41014053 They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, the elders and the teachers of the law came together.
41014054 Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.
41014055 The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any.
41014056 Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.
41014057 Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him:
41014058 “We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with human hands and in three days will build another, not made with hands.’ ”
41014059 Yet even then their testimony did not agree.
41014060 Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, “Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?”
41014061 But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?”
41014062 “I am,” said Jesus. “And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.”
41014063 The high priest tore his clothes. “Why do we need any more witnesses?” he asked.
41014064 “You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?” They all condemned him as worthy of death.
41014065 Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, “Prophesy!” And the guards took him and beat him.
41014066 While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by.
41014067 When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. “You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus,” she said.
41014068 But he denied it. “I don’t know or understand what you’re talking about,” he said, and went out into the entryway.
41014069 When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, “This fellow is one of them.”
41014070 Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, “Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.”
41014071 He began to call down curses, and he swore to them, “I don’t know this man you’re talking about.”
41014072 Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times.” And he broke down and wept.
41015001 Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, made their plans. So they bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate.
41015002 “Are you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate. “You have said so,” Jesus replied.
41015003 The chief priests accused him of many things.
41015004 So again Pilate asked him, “Aren’t you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of.”
41015005 But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed.
41015006 Now it was the custom at the festival to release a prisoner whom the people requested.
41015007 A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising.
41015008 The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did.
41015009 “Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate,
41015010 knowing it was out of self-interest that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.
41015011 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead.
41015012 “What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?” Pilate asked them.
41015013 “Crucify him!” they shouted.
41015014 “Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!”
41015015 Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.
41015016 The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers.
41015017 They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him.
41015018 And they began to call out to him, “Hail, king of the Jews!”
41015019 Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him.
41015020 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.
41015021 A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross.
41015022 They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means “the place of the skull”).
41015023 Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.
41015024 And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get.
41015025 It was nine in the morning when they crucified him.
41015026 The written notice of the charge against him read: the king of the jews.
41015027 They crucified two rebels with him, one on his right and one on his left.
41015028 
41015029 Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, “So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days,
41015030 come down from the cross and save yourself !”
41015031 In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. “He saved others,” they said, “but he can’t save himself!
41015032 Let this Messiah, this king of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.” Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.
41015033 At noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.
41015034 And at three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” (which means “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”).
41015035 When some of those standing near heard this, they said, “Listen, he’s calling Elijah.”
41015036 Someone ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink. “Now leave him alone. Let’s see if Elijah comes to take him down,” he said.
41015037 With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.
41015038 The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
41015039 And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, saw how he died, he said, “Surely this man was the Son of God!”
41015040 Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joseph, and Salome.
41015041 In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.
41015042 It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached,
41015043 Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body.
41015044 Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died.
41015045 When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.
41015046 So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
41015047 Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where he was laid.
41016001 When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus’ body.
41016002 Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb
41016003 and they asked each other, “Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?”
41016004 But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away.
41016005 As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.
41016006 “Don’t be alarmed,” he said. “You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him.
41016007 But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.’ ”
41016008 Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.
41016009 When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons.
41016010 She went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping.
41016011 When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it.
41016012 Afterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country.
41016013 These returned and reported it to the rest; but they did not believe them either.
41016014 Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen.
41016015 He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.
41016016 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
41016017 And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;
41016018 they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.”
41016019 After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God.
41016020 Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it.
42001001 Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us,
42001002 just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.
42001003 With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,
42001004 so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.
42001005 In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.
42001006 Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord’s commands and decrees blamelessly.
42001007 But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and they were both very old.
42001008 Once when Zechariah’s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,
42001009 he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
42001010 And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.
42001011 Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
42001012 When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.
42001013 But the angel said to him: “Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John.
42001014 He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth,
42001015 for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born.
42001016 He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God.
42001017 And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”
42001018 Zechariah asked the angel, “How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years.”
42001019 The angel said to him, “I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.
42001020 And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their appointed time.”
42001021 Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.
42001022 When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.
42001023 When his time of service was completed, he returned home.
42001024 After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion.
42001025 “The Lord has done this for me,” she said. “In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.”
42001026 In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,
42001027 to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin’s name was Mary.
42001028 The angel went to her and said, “Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.”
42001029 Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
42001030 But the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God.
42001031 You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus.
42001032 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,
42001033 and he will reign over Jacob’s descendants forever; his kingdom will never end.”
42001034 “How will this be,” Mary asked the angel, “since I am a virgin?”
42001035 The angel answered, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.
42001036 Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month.
42001037 For no word from God will ever fail.”
42001038 “I am the Lord’s servant,” Mary answered. “May your word to me be fulfilled.” Then the angel left her.
42001039 At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea,
42001040 where she entered Zechariah’s home and greeted Elizabeth.
42001041 When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
42001042 In a loud voice she exclaimed: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!
42001043 But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
42001044 As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
42001045 Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!”
42001046 And Mary said: “My soul glorifies the Lord
42001047 and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
42001048 for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed,
42001049 for the Mighty One has done great things for me— holy is his name.
42001050 His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation.
42001051 He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.
42001052 He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble.
42001053 He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty.
42001054 He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful
42001055 to Abraham and his descendants forever, just as he promised our ancestors.”
42001056 Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.
42001057 When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son.
42001058 Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.
42001059 On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah,
42001060 but his mother spoke up and said, “No! He is to be called John.”
42001061 They said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who has that name.”
42001062 Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child.
42001063 He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone’s astonishment he wrote, “His name is John.”
42001064 Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began to speak, praising God.
42001065 All the neighbors were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things.
42001066 Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, “What then is this child going to be?” For the Lord’s hand was with him.
42001067 His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:
42001068 “Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come to his people and redeemed them.
42001069 He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David
42001070 (as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),
42001071 salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us—
42001072 to show mercy to our ancestors and to remember his holy covenant,
42001073 the oath he swore to our father Abraham:
42001074 to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear
42001075 in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
42001076 And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,
42001077 to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins,
42001078 because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven
42001079 to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace.”
42001080 And the child grew and became strong in spirit ; and he lived in the wilderness until he appeared publicly to Israel.
42002001 In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.
42002002 (This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.)
42002003 And everyone went to their own town to register.
42002004 So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.
42002005 He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.
42002006 While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,
42002007 and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.
42002008 And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.
42002009 An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
42002010 But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people.
42002011 Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord.
42002012 This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.”
42002013 Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,
42002014 “Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.”
42002015 When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.”
42002016 So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger.
42002017 When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child,
42002018 and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.
42002019 But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.
42002020 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.
42002021 On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise the child, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he was conceived.
42002022 When the time came for the purification rites required by the Law of Moses, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord
42002023 (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord” ),
42002024 and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: “a pair of doves or two young pigeons.”
42002025 Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.
42002026 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord’s Messiah.
42002027 Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required,
42002028 Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying:
42002029 “Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you may now dismiss your servant in peace.
42002030 For my eyes have seen your salvation,
42002031 which you have prepared in the sight of all nations:
42002032 a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel.”
42002033 The child’s father and mother marveled at what was said about him.
42002034 Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: “This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against,
42002035 so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too.”
42002036 There was also a prophet, Anna, the daughter of Penuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,
42002037 and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying.
42002038 Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.
42002039 When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.
42002040 And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was on him.
42002041 Every year Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover.
42002042 When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival, according to the custom.
42002043 After the festival was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it.
42002044 Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends.
42002045 When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him.
42002046 After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.
42002047 Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.
42002048 When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.”
42002049 “Why were you searching for me?” he asked. “Didn’t you know I had to be in my Father’s house?”
42002050 But they did not understand what he was saying to them.
42002051 Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart.
42002052 And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.
42003001 In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar—when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene—
42003002 during the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness.
42003003 He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
42003004 As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: “A voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.
42003005 Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth.
42003006 And all people will see God’s salvation.’ ”
42003007 John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
42003008 Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
42003009 The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”
42003010 “What should we do then?” the crowd asked.
42003011 John answered, “Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same.”
42003012 Even tax collectors came to be baptized. “Teacher,” they asked, “what should we do?”
42003013 “Don’t collect any more than you are required to,” he told them.
42003014 Then some soldiers asked him, “And what should we do?” He replied, “Don’t extort money and don’t accuse people falsely—be content with your pay.”
42003015 The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah.
42003016 John answered them all, “I baptize you with water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
42003017 His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
42003018 And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them.
42003019 But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of his marriage to Herodias, his brother’s wife, and all the other evil things he had done,
42003020 Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.
42003021 When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened
42003022 and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.”
42003023 Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph, the son of Heli,
42003024 the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melki, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,
42003025 the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,
42003026 the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josek, the son of Joda,
42003027 the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,
42003028 the son of Melki, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,
42003029 the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,
42003030 the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,
42003031 the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,
42003032 the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,
42003033 the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,
42003034 the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,
42003035 the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,
42003036 the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,
42003037 the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Kenan,
42003038 the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
42004001 Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,
42004002 where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them he was hungry.
42004003 The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.”
42004004 Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone.’ ”
42004005 The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world.
42004006 And he said to him, “I will give you all their authority and splendor; it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to.
42004007 If you worship me, it will all be yours.”
42004008 Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.’ ”
42004009 The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down from here.
42004010 For it is written: “ ‘He will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully;
42004011 they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’ ”
42004012 Jesus answered, “It is said: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’ ”
42004013 When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time.
42004014 Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside.
42004015 He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him.
42004016 He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read,
42004017 and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:
42004018 “The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free,
42004019 to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”
42004020 Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him.
42004021 He began by saying to them, “Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.”
42004022 All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” they asked.
42004023 Jesus said to them, “Surely you will quote this proverb to me: ‘Physician, heal yourself!’ And you will tell me, ‘Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.’ ”
42004024 “Truly I tell you,” he continued, “no prophet is accepted in his hometown.
42004025 I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah’s time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land.
42004026 Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon.
42004027 And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed—only Naaman the Syrian.”
42004028 All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.
42004029 They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff.
42004030 But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.
42004031 Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath he taught the people.
42004032 They were amazed at his teaching, because his words had authority.
42004033 In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an impure spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice,
42004034 “Go away! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”
42004035 “Be quiet!” Jesus said sternly. “Come out of him!” Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him.
42004036 All the people were amazed and said to each other, “What words these are! With authority and power he gives orders to impure spirits and they come out!”
42004037 And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area.
42004038 Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her.
42004039 So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them.
42004040 At sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them.
42004041 Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Messiah.
42004042 At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them.
42004043 But he said, “I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent.”
42004044 And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
42005001 One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, the people were crowding around him and listening to the word of God.
42005002 He saw at the water’s edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets.
42005003 He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.
42005004 When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.”
42005005 Simon answered, “Master, we’ve worked hard all night and haven’t caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.”
42005006 When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.
42005007 So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.
42005008 When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’ knees and said, “Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!”
42005009 For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken,
42005010 and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon’s partners. Then Jesus said to Simon, “Don’t be afraid; from now on you will fish for people.”
42005011 So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him.
42005012 While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”
42005013 Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!” And immediately the leprosy left him.
42005014 Then Jesus ordered him, “Don’t tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”
42005015 Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses.
42005016 But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.
42005017 One day Jesus was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there. They had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal the sick.
42005018 Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus.
42005019 When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.
42005020 When Jesus saw their faith, he said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven.”
42005021 The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, “Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
42005022 Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?
42005023 Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?
42005024 But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” So he said to the paralyzed man, “I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.”
42005025 Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home praising God.
42005026 Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, “We have seen remarkable things today.”
42005027 After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. “Follow me,” Jesus said to him,
42005028 and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.
42005029 Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.
42005030 But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”
42005031 Jesus answered them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
42005032 I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”
42005033 They said to him, “John’s disciples often fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking.”
42005034 Jesus answered, “Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?
42005035 But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; in those days they will fast.”
42005036 He told them this parable: “No one tears a piece out of a new garment to patch an old one. Otherwise, they will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old.
42005037 And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined.
42005038 No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins.
42005039 And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for they say, ‘The old is better.’ ”
42006001 One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain, rub them in their hands and eat the kernels.
42006002 Some of the Pharisees asked, “Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?”
42006003 Jesus answered them, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
42006004 He entered the house of God, and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.”
42006005 Then Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”
42006006 On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled.
42006007 The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath.
42006008 But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, “Get up and stand in front of everyone.” So he got up and stood there.
42006009 Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?”
42006010 He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He did so, and his hand was completely restored.
42006011 But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.
42006012 One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God.
42006013 When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles:
42006014 Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,
42006015 Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot,
42006016 Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
42006017 He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon,
42006018 who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by impure spirits were cured,
42006019 and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all.
42006020 Looking at his disciples, he said: “Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
42006021 Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.
42006022 Blessed are you when people hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.
42006023 “Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their ancestors treated the prophets.
42006024 “But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort.
42006025 Woe to you who are well fed now, for you will go hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.
42006026 Woe to you when everyone speaks well of you, for that is how their ancestors treated the false prophets.
42006027 “But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
42006028 bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.
42006029 If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them.
42006030 Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back.
42006031 Do to others as you would have them do to you.
42006032 “If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.
42006033 And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that.
42006034 And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.
42006035 But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.
42006036 Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.
42006037 “Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.
42006038 Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.”
42006039 He also told them this parable: “Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit?
42006040 The student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.
42006041 “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?
42006042 How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.
42006043 “No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.
42006044 Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers.
42006045 A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.
42006046 “Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?
42006047 As for everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like.
42006048 They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built.
42006049 But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”
42007001 When Jesus had finished saying all this to the people who were listening, he entered Capernaum.
42007002 There a centurion’s servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die.
42007003 The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant.
42007004 When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, “This man deserves to have you do this,
42007005 because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.”
42007006 So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof.
42007007 That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed.
42007008 For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
42007009 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, “I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.”
42007010 Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.
42007011 Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him.
42007012 As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out—the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her.
42007013 When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, “Don’t cry.”
42007014 Then he went up and touched the bier they were carrying him on, and the bearers stood still. He said, “Young man, I say to you, get up!”
42007015 The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.
42007016 They were all filled with awe and praised God. “A great prophet has appeared among us,” they said. “God has come to help his people.”
42007017 This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country.
42007018 John’s disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them,
42007019 he sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?”
42007020 When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?’ ”
42007021 At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind.
42007022 So he replied to the messengers, “Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.
42007023 Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.”
42007024 After John’s messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?
42007025 If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.
42007026 But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
42007027 This is the one about whom it is written: “ ‘I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.’
42007028 I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.”
42007029 (All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus’ words, acknowledged that God’s way was right, because they had been baptized by John.
42007030 But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God’s purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.)
42007031 Jesus went on to say, “To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?
42007032 They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: “ ‘We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.’
42007033 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’
42007034 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’
42007035 But wisdom is proved right by all her children.”
42007036 When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, he went to the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table.
42007037 A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume.
42007038 As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.
42007039 When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner.”
42007040 Jesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to tell you.” “Tell me, teacher,” he said.
42007041 “Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
42007042 Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?”
42007043 Simon replied, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.” “You have judged correctly,” Jesus said.
42007044 Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.
42007045 You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.
42007046 You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.
42007047 Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.”
42007048 Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”
42007049 The other guests began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”
42007050 Jesus said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”
42008001 After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him,
42008002 and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out;
42008003 Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod’s household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means.
42008004 While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable:
42008005 “A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up.
42008006 Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture.
42008007 Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants.
42008008 Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.” When he said this, he called out, “Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”
42008009 His disciples asked him what this parable meant.
42008010 He said, “The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, “ ‘though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.’
42008011 “This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.
42008012 Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.
42008013 Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away.
42008014 The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life’s worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature.
42008015 But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.
42008016 “No one lights a lamp and hides it in a clay jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, they put it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light.
42008017 For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open.
42008018 Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they think they have will be taken from them.”
42008019 Now Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd.
42008020 Someone told him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.”
42008021 He replied, “My mother and brothers are those who hear God’s word and put it into practice.”
42008022 One day Jesus said to his disciples, “Let us go over to the other side of the lake.” So they got into a boat and set out.
42008023 As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger.
42008024 The disciples went and woke him, saying, “Master, Master, we’re going to drown!” He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm.
42008025 “Where is your faith?” he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement they asked one another, “Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him.”
42008026 They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee.
42008027 When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs.
42008028 When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torture me!”
42008029 For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.
42008030 Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” “Legion,” he replied, because many demons had gone into him.
42008031 And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.
42008032 A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission.
42008033 When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
42008034 When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside,
42008035 and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
42008036 Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured.
42008037 Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.
42008038 The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,
42008039 “Return home and tell how much God has done for you.” So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.
42008040 Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him.
42008041 Then a man named Jairus, a synagogue leader, came and fell at Jesus’ feet, pleading with him to come to his house
42008042 because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him.
42008043 And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her.
42008044 She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.
42008045 “Who touched me?” Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you.”
42008046 But Jesus said, “Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me.”
42008047 Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed.
42008048 Then he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.”
42008049 While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” he said. “Don’t bother the teacher anymore.”
42008050 Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, “Don’t be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.”
42008051 When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child’s father and mother.
42008052 Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. “Stop wailing,” Jesus said. “She is not dead but asleep.”
42008053 They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.
42008054 But he took her by the hand and said, “My child, get up!”
42008055 Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat.
42008056 Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.
42009001 When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases,
42009002 and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
42009003 He told them: “Take nothing for the journey—no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra shirt.
42009004 Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town.
42009005 If people do not welcome you, leave their town and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”
42009006 So they set out and went from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere.
42009007 Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead,
42009008 others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life.
42009009 But Herod said, “I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?” And he tried to see him.
42009010 When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida,
42009011 but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.
42009012 Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, “Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here.”
42009013 He replied, “You give them something to eat.” They answered, “We have only five loaves of bread and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all this crowd.”
42009014 (About five thousand men were there.) But he said to his disciples, “Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”
42009015 The disciples did so, and everyone sat down.
42009016 Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people.
42009017 They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
42009018 Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, “Who do the crowds say I am?”
42009019 They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life.”
42009020 “But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?” Peter answered, “God’s Messiah.”
42009021 Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone.
42009022 And he said, “The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.”
42009023 Then he said to them all: “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me.
42009024 For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will save it.
42009025 What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit their very self?
42009026 Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
42009027 “Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.”
42009028 About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray.
42009029 As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning.
42009030 Two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus.
42009031 They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem.
42009032 Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.
42009033 As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.” (He did not know what he was saying.)
42009034 While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and covered them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.
42009035 A voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him.”
42009036 When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves and did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen.
42009037 The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.
42009038 A man in the crowd called out, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.
42009039 A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him.
42009040 I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not.”
42009041 “You unbelieving and perverse generation,” Jesus replied, “how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.”
42009042 Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father.
42009043 And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples,
42009044 “Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.”
42009045 But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.
42009046 An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest.
42009047 Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him.
42009048 Then he said to them, “Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For it is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest.”
42009049 “Master,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us.”
42009050 “Do not stop him,” Jesus said, “for whoever is not against you is for you.”
42009051 As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.
42009052 And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him;
42009053 but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem.
42009054 When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, “Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them ?”
42009055 But Jesus turned and rebuked them.
42009056 Then he and his disciples went to another village.
42009057 As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go.”
42009058 Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”
42009059 He said to another man, “Follow me.” But he replied, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”
42009060 Jesus said to him, “Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.”
42009061 Still another said, “I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family.”
42009062 Jesus replied, “No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.”
42010001 After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go.
42010002 He told them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.
42010003 Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.
42010004 Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road.
42010005 “When you enter a house, first say, ‘Peace to this house.’
42010006 If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you.
42010007 Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house.
42010008 “When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you.
42010009 Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’
42010010 But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say,
42010011 ‘Even the dust of your town we wipe from our feet as a warning to you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God has come near.’
42010012 I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.
42010013 “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
42010014 But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
42010015 And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades.
42010016 “Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; but whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me.”
42010017 The seventy-two returned with joy and said, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.”
42010018 He replied, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.
42010019 I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.
42010020 However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”
42010021 At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do.
42010022 “All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.”
42010023 Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, “Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.
42010024 For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.”
42010025 On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
42010026 “What is written in the Law?” he replied. “How do you read it?”
42010027 He answered, “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’ ; and, ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ ”
42010028 “You have answered correctly,” Jesus replied. “Do this and you will live.”
42010029 But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”
42010030 In reply Jesus said: “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead.
42010031 A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side.
42010032 So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.
42010033 But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him.
42010034 He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him.
42010035 The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Look after him,’ he said, ‘and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.’
42010036 “Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?”
42010037 The expert in the law replied, “The one who had mercy on him.” Jesus told him, “Go and do likewise.”
42010038 As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him.
42010039 She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to what he said.
42010040 But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!”
42010041 “Martha, Martha,” the Lord answered, “you are worried and upset about many things,
42010042 but few things are needed—or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.”
42011001 One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.”
42011002 He said to them, “When you pray, say: “ ‘Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come.
42011003 Give us each day our daily bread.
42011004 Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And lead us not into temptation. ’ ”
42011005 Then Jesus said to them, “Suppose you have a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread;
42011006 a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have no food to offer him.’
42011007 And suppose the one inside answers, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is already locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can’t get up and give you anything.’
42011008 I tell you, even though he will not get up and give you the bread because of friendship, yet because of your shameless audacity he will surely get up and give you as much as you need.
42011009 “So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.
42011010 For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.
42011011 “Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?
42011012 Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?
42011013 If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”
42011014 Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed.
42011015 But some of them said, “By Beelzebul, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons.”
42011016 Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven.
42011017 Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: “Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall.
42011018 If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebul.
42011019 Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.
42011020 But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
42011021 “When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are safe.
42011022 But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up his plunder.
42011023 “Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.
42011024 “When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’
42011025 When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order.
42011026 Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first.”
42011027 As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, “Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you.”
42011028 He replied, “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.”
42011029 As the crowds increased, Jesus said, “This is a wicked generation. It asks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.
42011030 For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.
42011031 The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon’s wisdom; and now something greater than Solomon is here.
42011032 The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and now something greater than Jonah is here.
42011033 “No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light.
42011034 Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are unhealthy, your body also is full of darkness.
42011035 See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness.
42011036 Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be just as full of light as when a lamp shines its light on you.”
42011037 When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table.
42011038 But the Pharisee was surprised when he noticed that Jesus did not first wash before the meal.
42011039 Then the Lord said to him, “Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.
42011040 You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?
42011041 But now as for what is inside you—be generous to the poor, and everything will be clean for you.
42011042 “Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.
42011043 “Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces.
42011044 “Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which people walk over without knowing it.”
42011045 One of the experts in the law answered him, “Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us also.”
42011046 Jesus replied, “And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.
42011047 “Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your ancestors who killed them.
42011048 So you testify that you approve of what your ancestors did; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs.
42011049 Because of this, God in his wisdom said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.’
42011050 Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world,
42011051 from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held responsible for it all.
42011052 “Woe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering.”
42011053 When Jesus went outside, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions,
42011054 waiting to catch him in something he might say.
42012001 Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples, saying: “Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
42012002 There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.
42012003 What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.
42012004 “I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more.
42012005 But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after your body has been killed, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him.
42012006 Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God.
42012007 Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
42012008 “I tell you, whoever publicly acknowledges me before others, the Son of Man will also acknowledge before the angels of God.
42012009 But whoever disowns me before others will be disowned before the angels of God.
42012010 And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
42012011 “When you are brought before synagogues, rulers and authorities, do not worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say,
42012012 for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say.”
42012013 Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”
42012014 Jesus replied, “Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?”
42012015 Then he said to them, “Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.”
42012016 And he told them this parable: “The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest.
42012017 He thought to himself, ‘What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.’
42012018 “Then he said, ‘This is what I’ll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain.
42012019 And I’ll say to myself, “You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.” ’
42012020 “But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?’
42012021 “This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God.”
42012022 Then Jesus said to his disciples: “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear.
42012023 For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes.
42012024 Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds!
42012025 Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life ?
42012026 Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?
42012027 “Consider how the wild flowers grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.
42012028 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you—you of little faith!
42012029 And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it.
42012030 For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them.
42012031 But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.
42012032 “Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom.
42012033 Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys.
42012034 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
42012035 “Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning,
42012036 like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him.
42012037 It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them.
42012038 It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, even if he comes in the middle of the night or toward daybreak.
42012039 But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into.
42012040 You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.”
42012041 Peter asked, “Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?”
42012042 The Lord answered, “Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time?
42012043 It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns.
42012044 Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
42012045 But suppose the servant says to himself, ‘My master is taking a long time in coming,’ and he then begins to beat the other servants, both men and women, and to eat and drink and get drunk.
42012046 The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers.
42012047 “The servant who knows the master’s will and does not get ready or does not do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows.
42012048 But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.
42012049 “I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!
42012050 But I have a baptism to undergo, and what constraint I am under until it is completed!
42012051 Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division.
42012052 From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two and two against three.
42012053 They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”
42012054 He said to the crowd: “When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, ‘It’s going to rain,’ and it does.
42012055 And when the south wind blows, you say, ‘It’s going to be hot,’ and it is.
42012056 Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky. How is it that you don’t know how to interpret this present time?
42012057 “Why don’t you judge for yourselves what is right?
42012058 As you are going with your adversary to the magistrate, try hard to be reconciled on the way, or your adversary may drag you off to the judge, and the judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.
42012059 I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.”
42013001 Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
42013002 Jesus answered, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way?
42013003 I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.
42013004 Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them—do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem?
42013005 I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.”
42013006 Then he told this parable: “A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any.
42013007 So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, ‘For three years now I’ve been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?’
42013008 “ ‘Sir,’ the man replied, ‘leave it alone for one more year, and I’ll dig around it and fertilize it.
42013009 If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.’ ”
42013010 On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues,
42013011 and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all.
42013012 When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, “Woman, you are set free from your infirmity.”
42013013 Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God.
42013014 Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue leader said to the people, “There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath.”
42013015 The Lord answered him, “You hypocrites! Doesn’t each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water?
42013016 Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?”
42013017 When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing.
42013018 Then Jesus asked, “What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to?
42013019 It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds perched in its branches.”
42013020 Again he asked, “What shall I compare the kingdom of God to?
42013021 It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough.”
42013022 Then Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem.
42013023 Someone asked him, “Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?” He said to them,
42013024 “Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to.
42013025 Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand outside knocking and pleading, ‘Sir, open the door for us.’ “But he will answer, ‘I don’t know you or where you come from.’
42013026 “Then you will say, ‘We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.’
42013027 “But he will reply, ‘I don’t know you or where you come from. Away from me, all you evildoers!’
42013028 “There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out.
42013029 People will come from east and west and north and south, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God.
42013030 Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last.”
42013031 At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, “Leave this place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you.”
42013032 He replied, “Go tell that fox, ‘I will keep on driving out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.’
42013033 In any case, I must press on today and tomorrow and the next day—for surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem!
42013034 “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing.
42013035 Look, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.’ ”
42014001 One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he was being carefully watched.
42014002 There in front of him was a man suffering from abnormal swelling of his body.
42014003 Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?”
42014004 But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him on his way.
42014005 Then he asked them, “If one of you has a child or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull it out?”
42014006 And they had nothing to say.
42014007 When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable:
42014008 “When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited.
42014009 If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, ‘Give this person your seat.’ Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place.
42014010 But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, ‘Friend, move up to a better place.’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all the other guests.
42014011 For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”
42014012 Then Jesus said to his host, “When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or sisters, your relatives, or your rich neighbors; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid.
42014013 But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,
42014014 and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”
42014015 When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, “Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.”
42014016 Jesus replied: “A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests.
42014017 At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’
42014018 “But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, ‘I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.’
42014019 “Another said, ‘I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I’m on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.’
42014020 “Still another said, ‘I just got married, so I can’t come.’
42014021 “The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame.’
42014022 “ ‘Sir,’ the servant said, ‘what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.’
42014023 “Then the master told his servant, ‘Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full.
42014024 I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.’ ”
42014025 Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them he said:
42014026 “If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even their own life—such a person cannot be my disciple.
42014027 And whoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.
42014028 “Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won’t you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it?
42014029 For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you,
42014030 saying, ‘This person began to build and wasn’t able to finish.’
42014031 “Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Won’t he first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand?
42014032 If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace.
42014033 In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples.
42014034 “Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?
42014035 It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; it is thrown out. “Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”
42015001 Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus.
42015002 But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”
42015003 Then Jesus told them this parable:
42015004 “Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?
42015005 And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders
42015006 and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.’
42015007 I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.
42015008 “Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Doesn’t she light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?
42015009 And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.’
42015010 In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”
42015011 Jesus continued: “There was a man who had two sons.
42015012 The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the estate.’ So he divided his property between them.
42015013 “Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.
42015014 After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.
42015015 So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.
42015016 He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.
42015017 “When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!
42015018 I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.
42015019 I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.’
42015020 So he got up and went to his father. “But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.
42015021 “The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’
42015022 “But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.
42015023 Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate.
42015024 For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ So they began to celebrate.
42015025 “Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.
42015026 So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.
42015027 ‘Your brother has come,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’
42015028 “The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him.
42015029 But he answered his father, ‘Look! All these years I’ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.
42015030 But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’
42015031 “ ‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.
42015032 But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ ”
42016001 Jesus told his disciples: “There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions.
42016002 So he called him in and asked him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.’
42016003 “The manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I’m not strong enough to dig, and I’m ashamed to beg—
42016004 I know what I’ll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.’
42016005 “So he called in each one of his master’s debtors. He asked the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’
42016006 “ ‘Nine hundred gallons of olive oil,’ he replied. “The manager told him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred and fifty.’
42016007 “Then he asked the second, ‘And how much do you owe?’ “ ‘A thousand bushels of wheat,’ he replied. “He told him, ‘Take your bill and make it eight hundred.’
42016008 “The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light.
42016009 I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.
42016010 “Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.
42016011 So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?
42016012 And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else’s property, who will give you property of your own?
42016013 “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.”
42016014 The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus.
42016015 He said to them, “You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God’s sight.
42016016 “The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing their way into it.
42016017 It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.
42016018 “Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
42016019 “There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.
42016020 At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores
42016021 and longing to eat what fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.
42016022 “The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried.
42016023 In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side.
42016024 So he called to him, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.’
42016025 “But Abraham replied, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.
42016026 And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.’
42016027 “He answered, ‘Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family,
42016028 for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.’
42016029 “Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.’
42016030 “ ‘No, father Abraham,’ he said, ‘but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.’
42016031 “He said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’ ”
42017001 Jesus said to his disciples: “Things that cause people to stumble are bound to come, but woe to anyone through whom they come.
42017002 It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble.
42017003 So watch yourselves. “If your brother or sister sins against you, rebuke them; and if they repent, forgive them.
42017004 Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and seven times come back to you saying ‘I repent,’ you must forgive them.”
42017005 The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”
42017006 He replied, “If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it will obey you.
42017007 “Suppose one of you has a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Will he say to the servant when he comes in from the field, ‘Come along now and sit down to eat’?
42017008 Won’t he rather say, ‘Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink’?
42017009 Will he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do?
42017010 So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.’ ”
42017011 Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee.
42017012 As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him. They stood at a distance
42017013 and called out in a loud voice, “Jesus, Master, have pity on us!”
42017014 When he saw them, he said, “Go, show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went, they were cleansed.
42017015 One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice.
42017016 He threw himself at Jesus’ feet and thanked him—and he was a Samaritan.
42017017 Jesus asked, “Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?
42017018 Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?”
42017019 Then he said to him, “Rise and go; your faith has made you well.”
42017020 Once, on being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, “The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed,
42017021 nor will people say, ‘Here it is,’ or ‘There it is,’ because the kingdom of God is in your midst.”
42017022 Then he said to his disciples, “The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.
42017023 People will tell you, ‘There he is!’ or ‘Here he is!’ Do not go running off after them.
42017024 For the Son of Man in his day will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other.
42017025 But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
42017026 “Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man.
42017027 People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.
42017028 “It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.
42017029 But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.
42017030 “It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed.
42017031 On that day no one who is on the housetop, with possessions inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything.
42017032 Remember Lot’s wife!
42017033 Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life will preserve it.
42017034 I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left.
42017035 Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left.”
42017036 
42017037 “Where, Lord?” they asked. He replied, “Where there is a dead body, there the vultures will gather.”
42018001 Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up.
42018002 He said: “In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought.
42018003 And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, ‘Grant me justice against my adversary.’
42018004 “For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, ‘Even though I don’t fear God or care what people think,
42018005 yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won’t eventually come and attack me!’ ”
42018006 And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unjust judge says.
42018007 And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?
42018008 I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?”
42018009 To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable:
42018010 “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
42018011 The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.
42018012 I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’
42018013 “But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’
42018014 “I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”
42018015 People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his hands on them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.
42018016 But Jesus called the children to him and said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
42018017 Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”
42018018 A certain ruler asked him, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
42018019 “Why do you call me good?” Jesus answered. “No one is good—except God alone.
42018020 You know the commandments: ‘You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’ ”
42018021 “All these I have kept since I was a boy,” he said.
42018022 When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”
42018023 When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was very wealthy.
42018024 Jesus looked at him and said, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!
42018025 Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”
42018026 Those who heard this asked, “Who then can be saved?”
42018027 Jesus replied, “What is impossible with man is possible with God.”
42018028 Peter said to him, “We have left all we had to follow you!”
42018029 “Truly I tell you,” Jesus said to them, “no one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
42018030 will fail to receive many times as much in this age, and in the age to come eternal life.”
42018031 Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, “We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.
42018032 He will be delivered over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him and spit on him;
42018033 they will flog him and kill him. On the third day he will rise again.”
42018034 The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.
42018035 As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.
42018036 When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.
42018037 They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.”
42018038 He called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”
42018039 Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
42018040 Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him,
42018041 “What do you want me to do for you?” “Lord, I want to see,” he replied.
42018042 Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.”
42018043 Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God.
42019001 Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.
42019002 A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy.
42019003 He wanted to see who Jesus was, but because he was short he could not see over the crowd.
42019004 So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way.
42019005 When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today.”
42019006 So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.
42019007 All the people saw this and began to mutter, “He has gone to be the guest of a sinner.”
42019008 But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.”
42019009 Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham.
42019010 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”
42019011 While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once.
42019012 He said: “A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return.
42019013 So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. ‘Put this money to work,’ he said, ‘until I come back.’
42019014 “But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, ‘We don’t want this man to be our king.’
42019015 “He was made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with it.
42019016 “The first one came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has earned ten more.’
42019017 “ ‘Well done, my good servant!’ his master replied. ‘Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.’
42019018 “The second came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has earned five more.’
42019019 “His master answered, ‘You take charge of five cities.’
42019020 “Then another servant came and said, ‘Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth.
42019021 I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.’
42019022 “His master replied, ‘I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in, and reaping what I did not sow?
42019023 Why then didn’t you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?’
42019024 “Then he said to those standing by, ‘Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.’
42019025 “ ‘Sir,’ they said, ‘he already has ten!’
42019026 “He replied, ‘I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what they have will be taken away.
42019027 But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them—bring them here and kill them in front of me.’ ”
42019028 After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
42019029 As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them,
42019030 “Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.
42019031 If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ say, ‘The Lord needs it.’ ”
42019032 Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them.
42019033 As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, “Why are you untying the colt?”
42019034 They replied, “The Lord needs it.”
42019035 They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it.
42019036 As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road.
42019037 When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen:
42019038 “Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!” “Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”
42019039 Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!”
42019040 “I tell you,” he replied, “if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.”
42019041 As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it
42019042 and said, “If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes.
42019043 The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side.
42019044 They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God’s coming to you.”
42019045 When Jesus entered the temple courts, he began to drive out those who were selling.
42019046 “It is written,” he said to them, “ ‘My house will be a house of prayer’ ; but you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’ ”
42019047 Every day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him.
42019048 Yet they could not find any way to do it, because all the people hung on his words.
42020001 One day as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the good news, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, together with the elders, came up to him.
42020002 “Tell us by what authority you are doing these things,” they said. “Who gave you this authority?”
42020003 He replied, “I will also ask you a question. Tell me:
42020004 John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or of human origin?”
42020005 They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’
42020006 But if we say, ‘Of human origin,’ all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet.”
42020007 So they answered, “We don’t know where it was from.”
42020008 Jesus said, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”
42020009 He went on to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time.
42020010 At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
42020011 He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed.
42020012 He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.
42020013 “Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.’
42020014 “But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. ‘This is the heir,’ they said. ‘Let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’
42020015 So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. “What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
42020016 He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.” When the people heard this, they said, “God forbid!”
42020017 Jesus looked directly at them and asked, “Then what is the meaning of that which is written: “ ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone’ ?
42020018 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.”
42020019 The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.
42020020 Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be sincere. They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said, so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor.
42020021 So the spies questioned him: “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.
42020022 Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”
42020023 He saw through their duplicity and said to them,
42020024 “Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?” “Caesar’s,” they replied.
42020025 He said to them, “Then give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”
42020026 They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent.
42020027 Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question.
42020028 “Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.
42020029 Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless.
42020030 The second
42020031 and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children.
42020032 Finally, the woman died too.
42020033 Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?”
42020034 Jesus replied, “The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.
42020035 But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage,
42020036 and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God’s children, since they are children of the resurrection.
42020037 But in the account of the burning bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’
42020038 He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive.”
42020039 Some of the teachers of the law responded, “Well said, teacher!”
42020040 And no one dared to ask him any more questions.
42020041 Then Jesus said to them, “Why is it said that the Messiah is the son of David?
42020042 David himself declares in the Book of Psalms: “ ‘The Lord said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand
42020043 until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.” ’
42020044 David calls him ‘Lord.’ How then can he be his son?”
42020045 While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples,
42020046 “Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.
42020047 They devour widows’ houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will be punished most severely.”
42021001 As Jesus looked up, he saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple treasury.
42021002 He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins.
42021003 “Truly I tell you,” he said, “this poor widow has put in more than all the others.
42021004 All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on.”
42021005 Some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to God. But Jesus said,
42021006 “As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one of them will be thrown down.”
42021007 “Teacher,” they asked, “when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?”
42021008 He replied: “Watch out that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am he,’ and, ‘The time is near.’ Do not follow them.
42021009 When you hear of wars and uprisings, do not be frightened. These things must happen first, but the end will not come right away.”
42021010 Then he said to them: “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
42021011 There will be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven.
42021012 “But before all this, they will seize you and persecute you. They will hand you over to synagogues and put you in prison, and you will be brought before kings and governors, and all on account of my name.
42021013 And so you will bear testimony to me.
42021014 But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves.
42021015 For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.
42021016 You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers and sisters, relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death.
42021017 Everyone will hate you because of me.
42021018 But not a hair of your head will perish.
42021019 Stand firm, and you will win life.
42021020 “When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near.
42021021 Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country not enter the city.
42021022 For this is the time of punishment in fulfillment of all that has been written.
42021023 How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people.
42021024 They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
42021025 “There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea.
42021026 People will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken.
42021027 At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
42021028 When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”
42021029 He told them this parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the trees.
42021030 When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near.
42021031 Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near.
42021032 “Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
42021033 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
42021034 “Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you suddenly like a trap.
42021035 For it will come on all those who live on the face of the whole earth.
42021036 Be always on the watch, and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen, and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man.”
42021037 Each day Jesus was teaching at the temple, and each evening he went out to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives,
42021038 and all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple.
42022001 Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching,
42022002 and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.
42022003 Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve.
42022004 And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus.
42022005 They were delighted and agreed to give him money.
42022006 He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.
42022007 Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.
42022008 Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.”
42022009 “Where do you want us to prepare for it?” they asked.
42022010 He replied, “As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters,
42022011 and say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’
42022012 He will show you a large room upstairs, all furnished. Make preparations there.”
42022013 They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.
42022014 When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table.
42022015 And he said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.
42022016 For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.”
42022017 After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, “Take this and divide it among you.
42022018 For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”
42022019 And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.”
42022020 In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.
42022021 But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table.
42022022 The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed. But woe to that man who betrays him!”
42022023 They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this.
42022024 A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest.
42022025 Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors.
42022026 But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.
42022027 For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.
42022028 You are those who have stood by me in my trials.
42022029 And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me,
42022030 so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
42022031 “Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat.
42022032 But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”
42022033 But he replied, “Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.”
42022034 Jesus answered, “I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.”
42022035 Then Jesus asked them, “When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?” “Nothing,” they answered.
42022036 He said to them, “But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don’t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.
42022037 It is written: ‘And he was numbered with the transgressors’ ; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.”
42022038 The disciples said, “See, Lord, here are two swords.” “That’s enough!” he replied.
42022039 Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.
42022040 On reaching the place, he said to them, “Pray that you will not fall into temptation.”
42022041 He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed,
42022042 “Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.”
42022043 An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.
42022044 And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.
42022045 When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.
42022046 “Why are you sleeping?” he asked them. “Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.”
42022047 While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him,
42022048 but Jesus asked him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”
42022049 When Jesus’ followers saw what was going to happen, they said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?”
42022050 And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.
42022051 But Jesus answered, “No more of this!” And he touched the man’s ear and healed him.
42022052 Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, “Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?
42022053 Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour—when darkness reigns.”
42022054 Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.
42022055 And when some there had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them.
42022056 A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, “This man was with him.”
42022057 But he denied it. “Woman, I don’t know him,” he said.
42022058 A little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” “Man, I am not!” Peter replied.
42022059 About an hour later another asserted, “Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean.”
42022060 Peter replied, “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed.
42022061 The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.”
42022062 And he went outside and wept bitterly.
42022063 The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him.
42022064 They blindfolded him and demanded, “Prophesy! Who hit you?”
42022065 And they said many other insulting things to him.
42022066 At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and the teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them.
42022067 “If you are the Messiah,” they said, “tell us.” Jesus answered, “If I tell you, you will not believe me,
42022068 and if I asked you, you would not answer.
42022069 But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.”
42022070 They all asked, “Are you then the Son of God?” He replied, “You say that I am.”
42022071 Then they said, “Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips.”
42023001 Then the whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate.
42023002 And they began to accuse him, saying, “We have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Messiah, a king.”
42023003 So Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus replied.
42023004 Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”
42023005 But they insisted, “He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here.”
42023006 On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean.
42023007 When he learned that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.
42023008 When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform a sign of some sort.
42023009 He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer.
42023010 The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him.
42023011 Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate.
42023012 That day Herod and Pilate became friends—before this they had been enemies.
42023013 Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people,
42023014 and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him.
42023015 Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death.
42023016 Therefore, I will punish him and then release him.”
42023017 
42023018 But the whole crowd shouted, “Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!”
42023019 (Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.)
42023020 Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again.
42023021 But they kept shouting, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”
42023022 For the third time he spoke to them: “Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him.”
42023023 But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified, and their shouts prevailed.
42023024 So Pilate decided to grant their demand.
42023025 He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will.
42023026 As the soldiers led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus.
42023027 A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him.
42023028 Jesus turned and said to them, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children.
42023029 For the time will come when you will say, ‘Blessed are the childless women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!’
42023030 Then “ ‘they will say to the mountains, “Fall on us!” and to the hills, “Cover us!” ’
42023031 For if people do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?”
42023032 Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed.
42023033 When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him there, along with the criminals—one on his right, the other on his left.
42023034 Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.
42023035 The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, “He saved others; let him save himself if he is God’s Messiah, the Chosen One.”
42023036 The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar
42023037 and said, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.”
42023038 There was a written notice above him, which read: this is the king of the jews.
42023039 One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: “Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!”
42023040 But the other criminal rebuked him. “Don’t you fear God,” he said, “since you are under the same sentence?
42023041 We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.”
42023042 Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom. ”
42023043 Jesus answered him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.”
42023044 It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon,
42023045 for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two.
42023046 Jesus called out with a loud voice, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.” When he had said this, he breathed his last.
42023047 The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, “Surely this was a righteous man.”
42023048 When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away.
42023049 But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.
42023050 Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man,
42023051 who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea, and he himself was waiting for the kingdom of God.
42023052 Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus’ body.
42023053 Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid.
42023054 It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.
42023055 The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it.
42023056 Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.
42024001 On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.
42024002 They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,
42024003 but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
42024004 While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.
42024005 In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead?
42024006 He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee:
42024007 ‘The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.’ ”
42024008 Then they remembered his words.
42024009 When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.
42024010 It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles.
42024011 But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense.
42024012 Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.
42024013 Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.
42024014 They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.
42024015 As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them;
42024016 but they were kept from recognizing him.
42024017 He asked them, “What are you discussing together as you walk along?” They stood still, their faces downcast.
42024018 One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, “Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?”
42024019 “What things?” he asked. “About Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.
42024020 The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him;
42024021 but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place.
42024022 In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning
42024023 but didn’t find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive.
42024024 Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus.”
42024025 He said to them, “How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
42024026 Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?”
42024027 And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.
42024028 As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus continued on as if he were going farther.
42024029 But they urged him strongly, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.” So he went in to stay with them.
42024030 When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them.
42024031 Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight.
42024032 They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”
42024033 They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together
42024034 and saying, “It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.”
42024035 Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.
42024036 While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.”
42024037 They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost.
42024038 He said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?
42024039 Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.”
42024040 When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.
42024041 And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”
42024042 They gave him a piece of broiled fish,
42024043 and he took it and ate it in their presence.
42024044 He said to them, “This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.”
42024045 Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.
42024046 He told them, “This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,
42024047 and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
42024048 You are witnesses of these things.
42024049 I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”
42024050 When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them.
42024051 While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven.
42024052 Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.
42024053 And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.
43001001 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
43001002 He was with God in the beginning.
43001003 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.
43001004 In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind.
43001005 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
43001006 There was a man sent from God whose name was John.
43001007 He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe.
43001008 He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.
43001009 The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.
43001010 He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.
43001011 He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.
43001012 Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God—
43001013 children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God.
43001014 The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.
43001015 (John testified concerning him. He cried out, saying, “This is the one I spoke about when I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.’ ”)
43001016 Out of his fullness we have all received grace in place of grace already given.
43001017 For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
43001018 No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known.
43001019 Now this was John’s testimony when the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was.
43001020 He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, “I am not the Messiah.”
43001021 They asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” He answered, “No.”
43001022 Finally they said, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”
43001023 John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, “I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way for the Lord.’ ”
43001024 Now the Pharisees who had been sent
43001025 questioned him, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”
43001026 “I baptize with water,” John replied, “but among you stands one you do not know.
43001027 He is the one who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.”
43001028 This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
43001029 The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
43001030 This is the one I meant when I said, ‘A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.’
43001031 I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.”
43001032 Then John gave this testimony: “I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.
43001033 And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’
43001034 I have seen and I testify that this is God’s Chosen One.”
43001035 The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.
43001036 When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”
43001037 When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.
43001038 Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, “What do you want?” They said, “Rabbi” (which means “Teacher”), “where are you staying?”
43001039 “Come,” he replied, “and you will see.” So they went and saw where he was staying, and they spent that day with him. It was about four in the afternoon.
43001040 Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus.
43001041 The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, “We have found the Messiah” (that is, the Christ).
43001042 And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which, when translated, is Peter ).
43001043 The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, “Follow me.”
43001044 Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.
43001045 Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”
43001046 “Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?” Nathanael asked. “Come and see,” said Philip.
43001047 When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, “Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit.”
43001048 “How do you know me?” Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, “I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.”
43001049 Then Nathanael declared, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the king of Israel.”
43001050 Jesus said, “You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You will see greater things than that.”
43001051 He then added, “Very truly I tell you, you will see ‘heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on’ the Son of Man.”
43002001 On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there,
43002002 and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.
43002003 When the wine was gone, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no more wine.”
43002004 “Woman, why do you involve me?” Jesus replied. “My hour has not yet come.”
43002005 His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”
43002006 Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons.
43002007 Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water”; so they filled them to the brim.
43002008 Then he told them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.” They did so,
43002009 and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside
43002010 and said, “Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now.”
43002011 What Jesus did here in Cana of Galilee was the first of the signs through which he revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.
43002012 After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days.
43002013 When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
43002014 In the temple courts he found people selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money.
43002015 So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.
43002016 To those who sold doves he said, “Get these out of here! Stop turning my Father’s house into a market!”
43002017 His disciples remembered that it is written: “Zeal for your house will consume me.”
43002018 The Jews then responded to him, “What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?”
43002019 Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.”
43002020 They replied, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?”
43002021 But the temple he had spoken of was his body.
43002022 After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.
43002023 Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name.
43002024 But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all people.
43002025 He did not need any testimony about mankind, for he knew what was in each person.
43003001 Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council.
43003002 He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him.”
43003003 Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again. ”
43003004 “How can someone be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be born!”
43003005 Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.
43003006 Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.
43003007 You should not be surprised at my saying, ‘You must be born again.’
43003008 The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”
43003009 “How can this be?” Nicodemus asked.
43003010 “You are Israel’s teacher,” said Jesus, “and do you not understand these things?
43003011 Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony.
43003012 I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?
43003013 No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven—the Son of Man.
43003014 Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,
43003015 that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him.”
43003016 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
43003017 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.
43003018 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.
43003019 This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil.
43003020 Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed.
43003021 But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.
43003022 After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized.
43003023 Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were coming and being baptized.
43003024 (This was before John was put in prison.)
43003025 An argument developed between some of John’s disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing.
43003026 They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan—the one you testified about—look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.”
43003027 To this John replied, “A person can receive only what is given them from heaven.
43003028 You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him.’
43003029 The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete.
43003030 He must become greater; I must become less.”
43003031 The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all.
43003032 He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony.
43003033 Whoever has accepted it has certified that God is truthful.
43003034 For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit.
43003035 The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands.
43003036 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them.
43004001 Now Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that he was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John—
43004002 although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples.
43004003 So he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee.
43004004 Now he had to go through Samaria.
43004005 So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
43004006 Jacob’s well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about noon.
43004007 When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, “Will you give me a drink?”
43004008 (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)
43004009 The Samaritan woman said to him, “You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans. )
43004010 Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.”
43004011 “Sir,” the woman said, “you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water?
43004012 Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his livestock?”
43004013 Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,
43004014 but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”
43004015 The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water so that I won’t get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.”
43004016 He told her, “Go, call your husband and come back.”
43004017 “I have no husband,” she replied. Jesus said to her, “You are right when you say you have no husband.
43004018 The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.”
43004019 “Sir,” the woman said, “I can see that you are a prophet.
43004020 Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.”
43004021 “Woman,” Jesus replied, “believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
43004022 You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.
43004023 Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.
43004024 God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.”
43004025 The woman said, “I know that Messiah” (called Christ) “is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.”
43004026 Then Jesus declared, “I, the one speaking to you—I am he.”
43004027 Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?”
43004028 Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people,
43004029 “Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?”
43004030 They came out of the town and made their way toward him.
43004031 Meanwhile his disciples urged him, “Rabbi, eat something.”
43004032 But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.”
43004033 Then his disciples said to each other, “Could someone have brought him food?”
43004034 “My food,” said Jesus, “is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.
43004035 Don’t you have a saying, ‘It’s still four months until harvest’? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.
43004036 Even now the one who reaps draws a wage and harvests a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together.
43004037 Thus the saying ‘One sows and another reaps’ is true.
43004038 I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.”
43004039 Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.”
43004040 So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days.
43004041 And because of his words many more became believers.
43004042 They said to the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.”
43004043 After the two days he left for Galilee.
43004044 (Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.)
43004045 When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, for they also had been there.
43004046 Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.
43004047 When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.
43004048 “Unless you people see signs and wonders,” Jesus told him, “you will never believe.”
43004049 The royal official said, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”
43004050 “Go,” Jesus replied, “your son will live.” The man took Jesus at his word and departed.
43004051 While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living.
43004052 When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, “Yesterday, at one in the afternoon, the fever left him.”
43004053 Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, “Your son will live.” So he and his whole household believed.
43004054 This was the second sign Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee.
43005001 Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish festivals.
43005002 Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.
43005003 Here a great number of disabled people used to lie—the blind, the lame, the paralyzed.
43005004 
43005005 One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.
43005006 When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, “Do you want to get well?”
43005007 “Sir,” the invalid replied, “I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.”
43005008 Then Jesus said to him, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.”
43005009 At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath,
43005010 and so the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.”
43005011 But he replied, “The man who made me well said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’ ”
43005012 So they asked him, “Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?”
43005013 The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.
43005014 Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, “See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.”
43005015 The man went away and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well.
43005016 So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began to persecute him.
43005017 In his defense Jesus said to them, “My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working.”
43005018 For this reason they tried all the more to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
43005019 Jesus gave them this answer: “Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.
43005020 For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, and he will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed.
43005021 For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.
43005022 Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,
43005023 that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.
43005024 “Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life.
43005025 Very truly I tell you, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.
43005026 For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself.
43005027 And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.
43005028 “Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice
43005029 and come out—those who have done what is good will rise to live, and those who have done what is evil will rise to be condemned.
43005030 By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.
43005031 “If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.
43005032 There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is true.
43005033 “You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.
43005034 Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved.
43005035 John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.
43005036 “I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to finish—the very works that I am doing—testify that the Father has sent me.
43005037 And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form,
43005038 nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent.
43005039 You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me,
43005040 yet you refuse to come to me to have life.
43005041 “I do not accept glory from human beings,
43005042 but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts.
43005043 I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.
43005044 How can you believe since you accept glory from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God ?
43005045 “But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set.
43005046 If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.
43005047 But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?”
43006001 Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias),
43006002 and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the signs he had performed by healing the sick.
43006003 Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples.
43006004 The Jewish Passover Festival was near.
43006005 When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, “Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?”
43006006 He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do.
43006007 Philip answered him, “It would take more than half a year’s wages to buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!”
43006008 Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, spoke up,
43006009 “Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?”
43006010 Jesus said, “Have the people sit down.” There was plenty of grass in that place, and they sat down (about five thousand men were there).
43006011 Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish.
43006012 When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, “Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted.”
43006013 So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.
43006014 After the people saw the sign Jesus performed, they began to say, “Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.”
43006015 Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.
43006016 When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake,
43006017 where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them.
43006018 A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough.
43006019 When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were frightened.
43006020 But he said to them, “It is I; don’t be afraid.”
43006021 Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading.
43006022 The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone.
43006023 Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
43006024 Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus.
43006025 When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?”
43006026 Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.
43006027 Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.”
43006028 Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?”
43006029 Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.”
43006030 So they asked him, “What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do?
43006031 Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’ ”
43006032 Jesus said to them, “Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.
43006033 For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”
43006034 “Sir,” they said, “always give us this bread.”
43006035 Then Jesus declared, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.
43006036 But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe.
43006037 All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.
43006038 For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.
43006039 And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day.
43006040 For my Father’s will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.”
43006041 At this the Jews there began to grumble about him because he said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.”
43006042 They said, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, ‘I came down from heaven’?”
43006043 “Stop grumbling among yourselves,” Jesus answered.
43006044 “No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will raise them up at the last day.
43006045 It is written in the Prophets: ‘They will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me.
43006046 No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father.
43006047 Very truly I tell you, the one who believes has eternal life.
43006048 I am the bread of life.
43006049 Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died.
43006050 But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die.
43006051 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”
43006052 Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”
43006053 Jesus said to them, “Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.
43006054 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.
43006055 For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink.
43006056 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them.
43006057 Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me.
43006058 This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.”
43006059 He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.
43006060 On hearing it, many of his disciples said, “This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?”
43006061 Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, “Does this offend you?
43006062 Then what if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before!
43006063 The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life.
43006064 Yet there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him.
43006065 He went on to say, “This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled them.”
43006066 From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.
43006067 “You do not want to leave too, do you?” Jesus asked the Twelve.
43006068 Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.
43006069 We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God.”
43006070 Then Jesus replied, “Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!”
43006071 (He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.)
43007001 After this, Jesus went around in Galilee. He did not want to go about in Judea because the Jewish leaders there were looking for a way to kill him.
43007002 But when the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near,
43007003 Jesus’ brothers said to him, “Leave Galilee and go to Judea, so that your disciples there may see the works you do.
43007004 No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things, show yourself to the world.”
43007005 For even his own brothers did not believe in him.
43007006 Therefore Jesus told them, “My time is not yet here; for you any time will do.
43007007 The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that its works are evil.
43007008 You go to the festival. I am not going up to this festival, because my time has not yet fully come.”
43007009 After he had said this, he stayed in Galilee.
43007010 However, after his brothers had left for the festival, he went also, not publicly, but in secret.
43007011 Now at the festival the Jewish leaders were watching for Jesus and asking, “Where is he?”
43007012 Among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him. Some said, “He is a good man.” Others replied, “No, he deceives the people.”
43007013 But no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the leaders.
43007014 Not until halfway through the festival did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach.
43007015 The Jews there were amazed and asked, “How did this man get such learning without having been taught?”
43007016 Jesus answered, “My teaching is not my own. It comes from the one who sent me.
43007017 Anyone who chooses to do the will of God will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.
43007018 Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory, but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him.
43007019 Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?”
43007020 “You are demon-possessed,” the crowd answered. “Who is trying to kill you?”
43007021 Jesus said to them, “I did one miracle, and you are all amazed.
43007022 Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but from the patriarchs), you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath.
43007023 Now if a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing a man’s whole body on the Sabbath?
43007024 Stop judging by mere appearances, but instead judge correctly.”
43007025 At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, “Isn’t this the man they are trying to kill?
43007026 Here he is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying a word to him. Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Messiah?
43007027 But we know where this man is from; when the Messiah comes, no one will know where he is from.”
43007028 Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, “Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from. I am not here on my own authority, but he who sent me is true. You do not know him,
43007029 but I know him because I am from him and he sent me.”
43007030 At this they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.
43007031 Still, many in the crowd believed in him. They said, “When the Messiah comes, will he perform more signs than this man?”
43007032 The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him.
43007033 Jesus said, “I am with you for only a short time, and then I am going to the one who sent me.
43007034 You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come.”
43007035 The Jews said to one another, “Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
43007036 What did he mean when he said, ‘You will look for me, but you will not find me,’ and ‘Where I am, you cannot come’?”
43007037 On the last and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, “Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink.
43007038 Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them.”
43007039 By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.
43007040 On hearing his words, some of the people said, “Surely this man is the Prophet.”
43007041 Others said, “He is the Messiah.” Still others asked, “How can the Messiah come from Galilee?
43007042 Does not Scripture say that the Messiah will come from David’s descendants and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?”
43007043 Thus the people were divided because of Jesus.
43007044 Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him.
43007045 Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and the Pharisees, who asked them, “Why didn’t you bring him in?”
43007046 “No one ever spoke the way this man does,” the guards replied.
43007047 “You mean he has deceived you also?” the Pharisees retorted.
43007048 “Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?
43007049 No! But this mob that knows nothing of the law—there is a curse on them.”
43007050 Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked,
43007051 “Does our law condemn a man without first hearing him to find out what he has been doing?”
43007052 They replied, “Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee.” [The earliest manuscripts and many other ancient witnesses do not have John 7:53—8:11. A few manuscripts include these verses, wholly or in part, after John 7:36, John 21:25, Luke 21:38 or Luke 24:53.]
43007053 Then they all went home,
43008001 but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
43008002 At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them.
43008003 The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group
43008004 and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.
43008005 In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?”
43008006 They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger.
43008007 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.”
43008008 Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.
43008009 At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there.
43008010 Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”
43008011 “No one, sir,” she said. “Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Go now and leave your life of sin.”
43008012 When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”
43008013 The Pharisees challenged him, “Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid.”
43008014 Jesus answered, “Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going.
43008015 You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one.
43008016 But if I do judge, my decisions are true, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me.
43008017 In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true.
43008018 I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me.”
43008019 Then they asked him, “Where is your father?” “You do not know me or my Father,” Jesus replied. “If you knew me, you would know my Father also.”
43008020 He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his hour had not yet come.
43008021 Once more Jesus said to them, “I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come.”
43008022 This made the Jews ask, “Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, ‘Where I go, you cannot come’?”
43008023 But he continued, “You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.
43008024 I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am he, you will indeed die in your sins.”
43008025 “Who are you?” they asked. “Just what I have been telling you from the beginning,” Jesus replied.
43008026 “I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is trustworthy, and what I have heard from him I tell the world.”
43008027 They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.
43008028 So Jesus said, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.
43008029 The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him.”
43008030 Even as he spoke, many believed in him.
43008031 To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.
43008032 Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”
43008033 They answered him, “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?”
43008034 Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.
43008035 Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever.
43008036 So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.
43008037 I know that you are Abraham’s descendants. Yet you are looking for a way to kill me, because you have no room for my word.
43008038 I am telling you what I have seen in the Father’s presence, and you are doing what you have heard from your father. ”
43008039 “Abraham is our father,” they answered. “If you were Abraham’s children,” said Jesus, “then you would do what Abraham did.
43008040 As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.
43008041 You are doing the works of your own father.” “We are not illegitimate children,” they protested. “The only Father we have is God himself.”
43008042 Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me.
43008043 Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.
43008044 You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.
43008045 Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!
43008046 Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don’t you believe me?
43008047 Whoever belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.”
43008048 The Jews answered him, “Aren’t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?”
43008049 “I am not possessed by a demon,” said Jesus, “but I honor my Father and you dishonor me.
43008050 I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.
43008051 Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys my word will never see death.”
43008052 At this they exclaimed, “Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death.
43008053 Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?”
43008054 Jesus replied, “If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.
43008055 Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and obey his word.
43008056 Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.”
43008057 “You are not yet fifty years old,” they said to him, “and you have seen Abraham!”
43008058 “Very truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, I am!”
43008059 At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.
43009001 As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth.
43009002 His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”
43009003 “Neither this man nor his parents sinned,” said Jesus, “but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him.
43009004 As long as it is day, we must do the works of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work.
43009005 While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”
43009006 After saying this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man’s eyes.
43009007 “Go,” he told him, “wash in the Pool of Siloam” (this word means “Sent”). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing.
43009008 His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, “Isn’t this the same man who used to sit and beg?”
43009009 Some claimed that he was. Others said, “No, he only looks like him.” But he himself insisted, “I am the man.”
43009010 “How then were your eyes opened?” they asked.
43009011 He replied, “The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.”
43009012 “Where is this man?” they asked him. “I don’t know,” he said.
43009013 They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.
43009014 Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man’s eyes was a Sabbath.
43009015 Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. “He put mud on my eyes,” the man replied, “and I washed, and now I see.”
43009016 Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.” But others asked, “How can a sinner perform such signs?” So they were divided.
43009017 Then they turned again to the blind man, “What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened.” The man replied, “He is a prophet.”
43009018 They still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man’s parents.
43009019 “Is this your son?” they asked. “Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?”
43009020 “We know he is our son,” the parents answered, “and we know he was born blind.
43009021 But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.”
43009022 His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who already had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue.
43009023 That was why his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”
43009024 A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. “Give glory to God by telling the truth,” they said. “We know this man is a sinner.”
43009025 He replied, “Whether he is a sinner or not, I don’t know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!”
43009026 Then they asked him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”
43009027 He answered, “I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?”
43009028 Then they hurled insults at him and said, “You are this fellow’s disciple! We are disciples of Moses!
43009029 We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don’t even know where he comes from.”
43009030 The man answered, “Now that is remarkable! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.
43009031 We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly person who does his will.
43009032 Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.
43009033 If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”
43009034 To this they replied, “You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!” And they threw him out.
43009035 Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”
43009036 “Who is he, sir?” the man asked. “Tell me so that I may believe in him.”
43009037 Jesus said, “You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you.”
43009038 Then the man said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him.
43009039 Jesus said, “For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.”
43009040 Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, “What? Are we blind too?”
43009041 Jesus said, “If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.
43010001 “Very truly I tell you Pharisees, anyone who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber.
43010002 The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.
43010003 The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
43010004 When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.
43010005 But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger’s voice.”
43010006 Jesus used this figure of speech, but the Pharisees did not understand what he was telling them.
43010007 Therefore Jesus said again, “Very truly I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.
43010008 All who have come before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep have not listened to them.
43010009 I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. They will come in and go out, and find pasture.
43010010 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.
43010011 “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
43010012 The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.
43010013 The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.
43010014 “I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me—
43010015 just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep.
43010016 I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.
43010017 The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life—only to take it up again.
43010018 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.”
43010019 The Jews who heard these words were again divided.
43010020 Many of them said, “He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?”
43010021 But others said, “These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”
43010022 Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter,
43010023 and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon’s Colonnade.
43010024 The Jews who were there gathered around him, saying, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.”
43010025 Jesus answered, “I did tell you, but you do not believe. The works I do in my Father’s name testify about me,
43010026 but you do not believe because you are not my sheep.
43010027 My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.
43010028 I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand.
43010029 My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all ; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand.
43010030 I and the Father are one.”
43010031 Again his Jewish opponents picked up stones to stone him,
43010032 but Jesus said to them, “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?”
43010033 “We are not stoning you for any good work,” they replied, “but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.”
43010034 Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your Law, ‘I have said you are “gods” ’ ?
43010035 If he called them ‘gods,’ to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be set aside—
43010036 what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, ‘I am God’s Son’?
43010037 Do not believe me unless I do the works of my Father.
43010038 But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.”
43010039 Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped their grasp.
43010040 Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days. There he stayed,
43010041 and many people came to him. They said, “Though John never performed a sign, all that John said about this man was true.”
43010042 And in that place many believed in Jesus.
43011001 Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
43011002 (This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.)
43011003 So the sisters sent word to Jesus, “Lord, the one you love is sick.”
43011004 When he heard this, Jesus said, “This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God’s glory so that God’s Son may be glorified through it.”
43011005 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
43011006 So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days,
43011007 and then he said to his disciples, “Let us go back to Judea.”
43011008 “But Rabbi,” they said, “a short while ago the Jews there tried to stone you, and yet you are going back?”
43011009 Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in the daytime will not stumble, for they see by this world’s light.
43011010 It is when a person walks at night that they stumble, for they have no light.”
43011011 After he had said this, he went on to tell them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up.”
43011012 His disciples replied, “Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better.”
43011013 Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep.
43011014 So then he told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead,
43011015 and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”
43011016 Then Thomas (also known as Didymus ) said to the rest of the disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.”
43011017 On his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.
43011018 Now Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem,
43011019 and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother.
43011020 When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.
43011021 “Lord,” Martha said to Jesus, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
43011022 But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask.”
43011023 Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.”
43011024 Martha answered, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”
43011025 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die;
43011026 and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?”
43011027 “Yes, Lord,” she replied, “I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.”
43011028 After she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. “The Teacher is here,” she said, “and is asking for you.”
43011029 When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.
43011030 Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.
43011031 When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.
43011032 When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”
43011033 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.
43011034 “Where have you laid him?” he asked. “Come and see, Lord,” they replied.
43011035 Jesus wept.
43011036 Then the Jews said, “See how he loved him!”
43011037 But some of them said, “Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?”
43011038 Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.
43011039 “Take away the stone,” he said. “But, Lord,” said Martha, the sister of the dead man, “by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days.”
43011040 Then Jesus said, “Did I not tell you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?”
43011041 So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, “Father, I thank you that you have heard me.
43011042 I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me.”
43011043 When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”
43011044 The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, “Take off the grave clothes and let him go.”
43011045 Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him.
43011046 But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
43011047 Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. “What are we accomplishing?” they asked. “Here is this man performing many signs.
43011048 If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation.”
43011049 Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, “You know nothing at all!
43011050 You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.”
43011051 He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation,
43011052 and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one.
43011053 So from that day on they plotted to take his life.
43011054 Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of Judea. Instead he withdrew to a region near the wilderness, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.
43011055 When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover.
43011056 They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple courts they asked one another, “What do you think? Isn’t he coming to the festival at all?”
43011057 But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who found out where Jesus was should report it so that they might arrest him.
43012001 Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
43012002 Here a dinner was given in Jesus’ honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him.
43012003 Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus’ feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
43012004 But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected,
43012005 “Why wasn’t this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year’s wages. ”
43012006 He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.
43012007 “Leave her alone,” Jesus replied. “It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial.
43012008 You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.”
43012009 Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
43012010 So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well,
43012011 for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and believing in him.
43012012 The next day the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem.
43012013 They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, “Hosanna! ” “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!” “Blessed is the king of Israel!”
43012014 Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, as it is written:
43012015 “Do not be afraid, Daughter Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkey’s colt.”
43012016 At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that these things had been done to him.
43012017 Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word.
43012018 Many people, because they had heard that he had performed this sign, went out to meet him.
43012019 So the Pharisees said to one another, “See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!”
43012020 Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the festival.
43012021 They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. “Sir,” they said, “we would like to see Jesus.”
43012022 Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus.
43012023 Jesus replied, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
43012024 Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.
43012025 Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
43012026 Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me.
43012027 “Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this hour’? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour.
43012028 Father, glorify your name!” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.”
43012029 The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.
43012030 Jesus said, “This voice was for your benefit, not mine.
43012031 Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.
43012032 And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.”
43012033 He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.
43012034 The crowd spoke up, “We have heard from the Law that the Messiah will remain forever, so how can you say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’? Who is this ‘Son of Man’?”
43012035 Then Jesus told them, “You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. Whoever walks in the dark does not know where they are going.
43012036 Believe in the light while you have the light, so that you may become children of light.” When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.
43012037 Even after Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him.
43012038 This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: “Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”
43012039 For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere:
43012040 “He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn—and I would heal them.”
43012041 Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about him.
43012042 Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue;
43012043 for they loved human praise more than praise from God.
43012044 Then Jesus cried out, “Whoever believes in me does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me.
43012045 The one who looks at me is seeing the one who sent me.
43012046 I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness.
43012047 “If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge that person. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.
43012048 There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; the very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day.
43012049 For I did not speak on my own, but the Father who sent me commanded me to say all that I have spoken.
43012050 I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say.”
43013001 It was just before the Passover Festival. Jesus knew that the hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.
43013002 The evening meal was in progress, and the devil had already prompted Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus.
43013003 Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God;
43013004 so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist.
43013005 After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples’ feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
43013006 He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”
43013007 Jesus replied, “You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.”
43013008 “No,” said Peter, “you shall never wash my feet.” Jesus answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.”
43013009 “Then, Lord,” Simon Peter replied, “not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!”
43013010 Jesus answered, “Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet; their whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you.”
43013011 For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean.
43013012 When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. “Do you understand what I have done for you?” he asked them.
43013013 “You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and rightly so, for that is what I am.
43013014 Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet.
43013015 I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.
43013016 Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.
43013017 Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.
43013018 “I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill this passage of Scripture: ‘He who shared my bread has turned against me.’
43013019 “I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe that I am who I am.
43013020 Very truly I tell you, whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.”
43013021 After he had said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, “Very truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me.”
43013022 His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant.
43013023 One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him.
43013024 Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, “Ask him which one he means.”
43013025 Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, “Lord, who is it?”
43013026 Jesus answered, “It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.” Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.
43013027 As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. So Jesus told him, “What you are about to do, do quickly.”
43013028 But no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him.
43013029 Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the festival, or to give something to the poor.
43013030 As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night.
43013031 When he was gone, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified and God is glorified in him.
43013032 If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once.
43013033 “My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot come.
43013034 “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.
43013035 By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”
43013036 Simon Peter asked him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus replied, “Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow later.”
43013037 Peter asked, “Lord, why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.”
43013038 Then Jesus answered, “Will you really lay down your life for me? Very truly I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times!
43014001 “Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God ; believe also in me.
43014002 My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?
43014003 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.
43014004 You know the way to the place where I am going.”
43014005 Thomas said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?”
43014006 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
43014007 If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.”
43014008 Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.”
43014009 Jesus answered: “Don’t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?
43014010 Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.
43014011 Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves.
43014012 Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.
43014013 And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
43014014 You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.
43014015 “If you love me, keep my commands.
43014016 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever—
43014017 the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.
43014018 I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.
43014019 Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live.
43014020 On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.
43014021 Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them.”
43014022 Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, “But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?”
43014023 Jesus replied, “Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them.
43014024 Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.
43014025 “All this I have spoken while still with you.
43014026 But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.
43014027 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.
43014028 “You heard me say, ‘I am going away and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.
43014029 I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe.
43014030 I will not say much more to you, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold over me,
43014031 but he comes so that the world may learn that I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me. “Come now; let us leave.
43015001 “I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.
43015002 He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful.
43015003 You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.
43015004 Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.
43015005 “I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.
43015006 If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned.
43015007 If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.
43015008 This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.
43015009 “As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love.
43015010 If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commands and remain in his love.
43015011 I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.
43015012 My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.
43015013 Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.
43015014 You are my friends if you do what I command.
43015015 I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master’s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.
43015016 You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit—fruit that will last—and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you.
43015017 This is my command: Love each other.
43015018 “If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.
43015019 If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you.
43015020 Remember what I told you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also.
43015021 They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the one who sent me.
43015022 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
43015023 Whoever hates me hates my Father as well.
43015024 If I had not done among them the works no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. As it is, they have seen, and yet they have hated both me and my Father.
43015025 But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: ‘They hated me without reason.’
43015026 “When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father—he will testify about me.
43015027 And you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning.
43016001 “All this I have told you so that you will not fall away.
43016002 They will put you out of the synagogue; in fact, the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God.
43016003 They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me.
43016004 I have told you this, so that when their time comes you will remember that I warned you about them. I did not tell you this from the beginning because I was with you,
43016005 but now I am going to him who sent me. None of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’
43016006 Rather, you are filled with grief because I have said these things.
43016007 But very truly I tell you, it is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.
43016008 When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment:
43016009 about sin, because people do not believe in me;
43016010 about righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no longer;
43016011 and about judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned.
43016012 “I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear.
43016013 But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.
43016014 He will glorify me because it is from me that he will receive what he will make known to you.
43016015 All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what he will make known to you.”
43016016 Jesus went on to say, “In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me.”
43016017 At this, some of his disciples said to one another, “What does he mean by saying, ‘In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me,’ and ‘Because I am going to the Father’?”
43016018 They kept asking, “What does he mean by ‘a little while’? We don’t understand what he is saying.”
43016019 Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, “Are you asking one another what I meant when I said, ‘In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me’?
43016020 Very truly I tell you, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.
43016021 A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world.
43016022 So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy.
43016023 In that day you will no longer ask me anything. Very truly I tell you, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.
43016024 Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.
43016025 “Though I have been speaking figuratively, a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father.
43016026 In that day you will ask in my name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf.
43016027 No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.
43016028 I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.”
43016029 Then Jesus’ disciples said, “Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech.
43016030 Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions. This makes us believe that you came from God.”
43016031 “Do you now believe?” Jesus replied.
43016032 “A time is coming and in fact has come when you will be scattered, each to your own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me.
43016033 “I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”
43017001 After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed: “Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.
43017002 For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him.
43017003 Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.
43017004 I have brought you glory on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do.
43017005 And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.
43017006 “I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word.
43017007 Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you.
43017008 For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.
43017009 I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours.
43017010 All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them.
43017011 I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name, the name you gave me, so that they may be one as we are one.
43017012 While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled.
43017013 “I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them.
43017014 I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world.
43017015 My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.
43017016 They are not of the world, even as I am not of it.
43017017 Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.
43017018 As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world.
43017019 For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified.
43017020 “My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message,
43017021 that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.
43017022 I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one—
43017023 I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.
43017024 “Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world.
43017025 “Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me.
43017026 I have made you known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them.”
43018001 When he had finished praying, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was a garden, and he and his disciples went into it.
43018002 Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples.
43018003 So Judas came to the garden, guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and the Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns and weapons.
43018004 Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, “Who is it you want?”
43018005 “Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “I am he,” Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.)
43018006 When Jesus said, “I am he,” they drew back and fell to the ground.
43018007 Again he asked them, “Who is it you want?” “Jesus of Nazareth,” they said.
43018008 Jesus answered, “I told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, then let these men go.”
43018009 This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: “I have not lost one of those you gave me.”
43018010 Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant’s name was Malchus.)
43018011 Jesus commanded Peter, “Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?”
43018012 Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus. They bound him
43018013 and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.
43018014 Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it would be good if one man died for the people.
43018015 Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard,
43018016 but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the servant girl on duty there and brought Peter in.
43018017 “You aren’t one of this man’s disciples too, are you?” she asked Peter. He replied, “I am not.”
43018018 It was cold, and the servants and officials stood around a fire they had made to keep warm. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself.
43018019 Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.
43018020 “I have spoken openly to the world,” Jesus replied. “I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.
43018021 Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said.”
43018022 When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby slapped him in the face. “Is this the way you answer the high priest?” he demanded.
43018023 “If I said something wrong,” Jesus replied, “testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?”
43018024 Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
43018025 Meanwhile, Simon Peter was still standing there warming himself. So they asked him, “You aren’t one of his disciples too, are you?” He denied it, saying, “I am not.”
43018026 One of the high priest’s servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, “Didn’t I see you with him in the garden?”
43018027 Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow.
43018028 Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness they did not enter the palace, because they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.
43018029 So Pilate came out to them and asked, “What charges are you bringing against this man?”
43018030 “If he were not a criminal,” they replied, “we would not have handed him over to you.”
43018031 Pilate said, “Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.” “But we have no right to execute anyone,” they objected.
43018032 This took place to fulfill what Jesus had said about the kind of death he was going to die.
43018033 Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
43018034 “Is that your own idea,” Jesus asked, “or did others talk to you about me?”
43018035 “Am I a Jew?” Pilate replied. “Your own people and chief priests handed you over to me. What is it you have done?”
43018036 Jesus said, “My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place.”
43018037 “You are a king, then!” said Pilate. Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.”
43018038 “What is truth?” retorted Pilate. With this he went out again to the Jews gathered there and said, “I find no basis for a charge against him.
43018039 But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release ‘the king of the Jews’?”
43018040 They shouted back, “No, not him! Give us Barabbas!” Now Barabbas had taken part in an uprising.
43019001 Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.
43019002 The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe
43019003 and went up to him again and again, saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!” And they slapped him in the face.
43019004 Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews gathered there, “Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.”
43019005 When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”
43019006 As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, “Crucify! Crucify!” But Pilate answered, “You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.”
43019007 The Jewish leaders insisted, “We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.”
43019008 When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid,
43019009 and he went back inside the palace. “Where do you come from?” he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer.
43019010 “Do you refuse to speak to me?” Pilate said. “Don’t you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?”
43019011 Jesus answered, “You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.”
43019012 From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jewish leaders kept shouting, “If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar.”
43019013 When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge’s seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha).
43019014 It was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about noon. “Here is your king,” Pilate said to the Jews.
43019015 But they shouted, “Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!” “Shall I crucify your king?” Pilate asked. “We have no king but Caesar,” the chief priests answered.
43019016 Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. So the soldiers took charge of Jesus.
43019017 Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha).
43019018 There they crucified him, and with him two others—one on each side and Jesus in the middle.
43019019 Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: jesus of nazareth, the king of the jews.
43019020 Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek.
43019021 The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The King of the Jews,’ but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews.”
43019022 Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”
43019023 When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.
43019024 “Let’s not tear it,” they said to one another. “Let’s decide by lot who will get it.” This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled that said, “They divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment.” So this is what the soldiers did.
43019025 Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
43019026 When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her, “Woman, here is your son,”
43019027 and to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.
43019028 Later, knowing that everything had now been finished, and so that Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, “I am thirsty.”
43019029 A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus’ lips.
43019030 When he had received the drink, Jesus said, “It is finished.” With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
43019031 Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.
43019032 The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other.
43019033 But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.
43019034 Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus’ side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water.
43019035 The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.
43019036 These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: “Not one of his bones will be broken,”
43019037 and, as another scripture says, “They will look on the one they have pierced.”
43019038 Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jewish leaders. With Pilate’s permission, he came and took the body away.
43019039 He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds.
43019040 Taking Jesus’ body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs.
43019041 At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid.
43019042 Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.
43020001 Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.
43020002 So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don’t know where they have put him!”
43020003 So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.
43020004 Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.
43020005 He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in.
43020006 Then Simon Peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there,
43020007 as well as the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus’ head. The cloth was still lying in its place, separate from the linen.
43020008 Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed.
43020009 (They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.)
43020010 Then the disciples went back to where they were staying.
43020011 Now Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb
43020012 and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus’ body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.
43020013 They asked her, “Woman, why are you crying?” “They have taken my Lord away,” she said, “and I don’t know where they have put him.”
43020014 At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus.
43020015 He asked her, “Woman, why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?” Thinking he was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him.”
43020016 Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, “Rabboni!” (which means “Teacher”).
43020017 Jesus said, “Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’ ”
43020018 Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them that he had said these things to her.
43020019 On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!”
43020020 After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.
43020021 Again Jesus said, “Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.”
43020022 And with that he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit.
43020023 If you forgive anyone’s sins, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.”
43020024 Now Thomas (also known as Didymus ), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.
43020025 So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”
43020026 A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!”
43020027 Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.”
43020028 Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God!”
43020029 Then Jesus told him, “Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”
43020030 Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.
43020031 But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.
43021001 Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Galilee. It happened this way:
43021002 Simon Peter, Thomas (also known as Didymus ), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.
43021003 “I’m going out to fish,” Simon Peter told them, and they said, “We’ll go with you.” So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.
43021004 Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.
43021005 He called out to them, “Friends, haven’t you any fish?” “No,” they answered.
43021006 He said, “Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.” When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.
43021007 Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, “It is the Lord,” he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.
43021008 The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards.
43021009 When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread.
43021010 Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish you have just caught.”
43021011 So Simon Peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.
43021012 Jesus said to them, “Come and have breakfast.” None of the disciples dared ask him, “Who are you?” They knew it was the Lord.
43021013 Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.
43021014 This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.
43021015 When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?” “Yes, Lord,” he said, “you know that I love you.” Jesus said, “Feed my lambs.”
43021016 Again Jesus said, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” He answered, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” Jesus said, “Take care of my sheep.”
43021017 The third time he said to him, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, “Do you love me?” He said, “Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.” Jesus said, “Feed my sheep.
43021018 Very truly I tell you, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.”
43021019 Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, “Follow me!”
43021020 Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, “Lord, who is going to betray you?”)
43021021 When Peter saw him, he asked, “Lord, what about him?”
43021022 Jesus answered, “If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.”
43021023 Because of this, the rumor spread among the believers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, “If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?”
43021024 This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.
43021025 Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.
44001001 In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach
44001002 until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.
44001003 After his suffering, he presented himself to them and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God.
44001004 On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about.
44001005 For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”
44001006 Then they gathered around him and asked him, “Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?”
44001007 He said to them: “It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.
44001008 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”
44001009 After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight.
44001010 They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them.
44001011 “Men of Galilee,” they said, “why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.”
44001012 Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives, a Sabbath day’s walk from the city.
44001013 When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.
44001014 They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
44001015 In those days Peter stood up among the believers (a group numbering about a hundred and twenty)
44001016 and said, “Brothers and sisters, the Scripture had to be fulfilled in which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus.
44001017 He was one of our number and shared in our ministry.”
44001018 (With the payment he received for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out.
44001019 Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)
44001020 “For,” said Peter, “it is written in the Book of Psalms: “ ‘May his place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in it,’ and, “ ‘May another take his place of leadership.’
44001021 Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus was living among us,
44001022 beginning from John’s baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection.”
44001023 So they nominated two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias.
44001024 Then they prayed, “Lord, you know everyone’s heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen
44001025 to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs.”
44001026 Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.
44002001 When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.
44002002 Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.
44002003 They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.
44002004 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.
44002005 Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven.
44002006 When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard their own language being spoken.
44002007 Utterly amazed, they asked: “Aren’t all these who are speaking Galileans?
44002008 Then how is it that each of us hears them in our native language?
44002009 Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
44002010 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome
44002011 (both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs—we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!”
44002012 Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, “What does this mean?”
44002013 Some, however, made fun of them and said, “They have had too much wine.”
44002014 Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: “Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say.
44002015 These people are not drunk, as you suppose. It’s only nine in the morning!
44002016 No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:
44002017 “ ‘In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams.
44002018 Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.
44002019 I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and billows of smoke.
44002020 The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.
44002021 And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.’
44002022 “Fellow Israelites, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know.
44002023 This man was handed over to you by God’s deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross.
44002024 But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.
44002025 David said about him: “ ‘I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
44002026 Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will rest in hope,
44002027 because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, you will not let your holy one see decay.
44002028 You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.’
44002029 “Fellow Israelites, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day.
44002030 But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne.
44002031 Seeing what was to come, he spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, that he was not abandoned to the realm of the dead, nor did his body see decay.
44002032 God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it.
44002033 Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear.
44002034 For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, “ ‘The Lord said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand
44002035 until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.” ’
44002036 “Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.”
44002037 When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”
44002038 Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
44002039 The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.”
44002040 With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, “Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.”
44002041 Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.
44002042 They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
44002043 Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles.
44002044 All the believers were together and had everything in common.
44002045 They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need.
44002046 Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,
44002047 praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
44003001 One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer—at three in the afternoon.
44003002 Now a man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts.
44003003 When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money.
44003004 Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, “Look at us!”
44003005 So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them.
44003006 Then Peter said, “Silver or gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.”
44003007 Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man’s feet and ankles became strong.
44003008 He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God.
44003009 When all the people saw him walking and praising God,
44003010 they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
44003011 While the man held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon’s Colonnade.
44003012 When Peter saw this, he said to them: “Fellow Israelites, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?
44003013 The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed him over to be killed, and you disowned him before Pilate, though he had decided to let him go.
44003014 You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you.
44003015 You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses of this.
44003016 By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus’ name and the faith that comes through him that has completely healed him, as you can all see.
44003017 “Now, fellow Israelites, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders.
44003018 But this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying that his Messiah would suffer.
44003019 Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord,
44003020 and that he may send the Messiah, who has been appointed for you—even Jesus.
44003021 Heaven must receive him until the time comes for God to restore everything, as he promised long ago through his holy prophets.
44003022 For Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you must listen to everything he tells you.
44003023 Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from their people.’
44003024 “Indeed, beginning with Samuel, all the prophets who have spoken have foretold these days.
44003025 And you are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your fathers. He said to Abraham, ‘Through your offspring all peoples on earth will be blessed.’
44003026 When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways.”
44004001 The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to Peter and John while they were speaking to the people.
44004002 They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people, proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.
44004003 They seized Peter and John and, because it was evening, they put them in jail until the next day.
44004004 But many who heard the message believed; so the number of men who believed grew to about five thousand.
44004005 The next day the rulers, the elders and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem.
44004006 Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and others of the high priest’s family.
44004007 They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: “By what power or what name did you do this?”
44004008 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: “Rulers and elders of the people!
44004009 If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed,
44004010 then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed.
44004011 Jesus is “ ‘the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone.’
44004012 Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.”
44004013 When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus.
44004014 But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, there was nothing they could say.
44004015 So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred together.
44004016 “What are we going to do with these men?” they asked. “Everyone living in Jerusalem knows they have performed a notable sign, and we cannot deny it.
44004017 But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must warn them to speak no longer to anyone in this name.”
44004018 Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
44004019 But Peter and John replied, “Which is right in God’s eyes: to listen to you, or to him? You be the judges!
44004020 As for us, we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.”
44004021 After further threats they let them go. They could not decide how to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened.
44004022 For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old.
44004023 On their release, Peter and John went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
44004024 When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God. “Sovereign Lord,” they said, “you made the heavens and the earth and the sea, and everything in them.
44004025 You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our father David: “ ‘Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?
44004026 The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord and against his anointed one. ’
44004027 Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed.
44004028 They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen.
44004029 Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness.
44004030 Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”
44004031 After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.
44004032 All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had.
44004033 With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And God’s grace was so powerfully at work in them all
44004034 that there were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales
44004035 and put it at the apostles’ feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need.
44004036 Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means “son of encouragement”),
44004037 sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles’ feet.
44005001 Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property.
44005002 With his wife’s full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself, but brought the rest and put it at the apostles’ feet.
44005003 Then Peter said, “Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land?
44005004 Didn’t it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn’t the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied just to human beings but to God.”
44005005 When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard what had happened.
44005006 Then some young men came forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him.
44005007 About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
44005008 Peter asked her, “Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias got for the land?” “Yes,” she said, “that is the price.”
44005009 Peter said to her, “How could you conspire to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also.”
44005010 At that moment she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband.
44005011 Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events.
44005012 The apostles performed many signs and wonders among the people. And all the believers used to meet together in Solomon’s Colonnade.
44005013 No one else dared join them, even though they were highly regarded by the people.
44005014 Nevertheless, more and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number.
44005015 As a result, people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter’s shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by.
44005016 Crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those tormented by impure spirits, and all of them were healed.
44005017 Then the high priest and all his associates, who were members of the party of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy.
44005018 They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail.
44005019 But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out.
44005020 “Go, stand in the temple courts,” he said, “and tell the people all about this new life.”
44005021 At daybreak they entered the temple courts, as they had been told, and began to teach the people. When the high priest and his associates arrived, they called together the Sanhedrin—the full assembly of the elders of Israel—and sent to the jail for the apostles.
44005022 But on arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there. So they went back and reported,
44005023 “We found the jail securely locked, with the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside.”
44005024 On hearing this report, the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were at a loss, wondering what this might lead to.
44005025 Then someone came and said, “Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people.”
44005026 At that, the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles. They did not use force, because they feared that the people would stone them.
44005027 The apostles were brought in and made to appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest.
44005028 “We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,” he said. “Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man’s blood.”
44005029 Peter and the other apostles replied: “We must obey God rather than human beings!
44005030 The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead—whom you killed by hanging him on a cross.
44005031 God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior that he might bring Israel to repentance and forgive their sins.
44005032 We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.”
44005033 When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to put them to death.
44005034 But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while.
44005035 Then he addressed the Sanhedrin: “Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do to these men.
44005036 Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing.
44005037 After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered.
44005038 Therefore, in the present case I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail.
44005039 But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God.”
44005040 His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
44005041 The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.
44005042 Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah.
44006001 In those days when the number of disciples was increasing, the Hellenistic Jews among them complained against the Hebraic Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.
44006002 So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, “It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables.
44006003 Brothers and sisters, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them
44006004 and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word.”
44006005 This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit; also Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism.
44006006 They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.
44006007 So the word of God spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.
44006008 Now Stephen, a man full of God’s grace and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.
44006009 Opposition arose, however, from members of the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called)—Jews of Cyrene and Alexandria as well as the provinces of Cilicia and Asia—who began to argue with Stephen.
44006010 But they could not stand up against the wisdom the Spirit gave him as he spoke.
44006011 Then they secretly persuaded some men to say, “We have heard Stephen speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.”
44006012 So they stirred up the people and the elders and the teachers of the law. They seized Stephen and brought him before the Sanhedrin.
44006013 They produced false witnesses, who testified, “This fellow never stops speaking against this holy place and against the law.
44006014 For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs Moses handed down to us.”
44006015 All who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.
44007001 Then the high priest asked Stephen, “Are these charges true?”
44007002 To this he replied: “Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Harran.
44007003 ‘Leave your country and your people,’ God said, ‘and go to the land I will show you.’
44007004 “So he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Harran. After the death of his father, God sent him to this land where you are now living.
44007005 He gave him no inheritance here, not even enough ground to set his foot on. But God promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land, even though at that time Abraham had no child.
44007006 God spoke to him in this way: ‘For four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated.
44007007 But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,’ God said, ‘and afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this place.’
44007008 Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. And Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him eight days after his birth. Later Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.
44007009 “Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him as a slave into Egypt. But God was with him
44007010 and rescued him from all his troubles. He gave Joseph wisdom and enabled him to gain the goodwill of Pharaoh king of Egypt. So Pharaoh made him ruler over Egypt and all his palace.
44007011 “Then a famine struck all Egypt and Canaan, bringing great suffering, and our ancestors could not find food.
44007012 When Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our forefathers on their first visit.
44007013 On their second visit, Joseph told his brothers who he was, and Pharaoh learned about Joseph’s family.
44007014 After this, Joseph sent for his father Jacob and his whole family, seventy-five in all.
44007015 Then Jacob went down to Egypt, where he and our ancestors died.
44007016 Their bodies were brought back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a certain sum of money.
44007017 “As the time drew near for God to fulfill his promise to Abraham, the number of our people in Egypt had greatly increased.
44007018 Then ‘a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt.’
44007019 He dealt treacherously with our people and oppressed our ancestors by forcing them to throw out their newborn babies so that they would die.
44007020 “At that time Moses was born, and he was no ordinary child. For three months he was cared for by his family.
44007021 When he was placed outside, Pharaoh’s daughter took him and brought him up as her own son.
44007022 Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action.
44007023 “When Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his own people, the Israelites.
44007024 He saw one of them being mistreated by an Egyptian, so he went to his defense and avenged him by killing the Egyptian.
44007025 Moses thought that his own people would realize that God was using him to rescue them, but they did not.
44007026 The next day Moses came upon two Israelites who were fighting. He tried to reconcile them by saying, ‘Men, you are brothers; why do you want to hurt each other?’
44007027 “But the man who was mistreating the other pushed Moses aside and said, ‘Who made you ruler and judge over us?
44007028 Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’
44007029 When Moses heard this, he fled to Midian, where he settled as a foreigner and had two sons.
44007030 “After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai.
44007031 When he saw this, he was amazed at the sight. As he went over to get a closer look, he heard the Lord say:
44007032 ‘I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.’ Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look.
44007033 “Then the Lord said to him, ‘Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.
44007034 I have indeed seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come down to set them free. Now come, I will send you back to Egypt.’
44007035 “This is the same Moses they had rejected with the words, ‘Who made you ruler and judge?’ He was sent to be their ruler and deliverer by God himself, through the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
44007036 He led them out of Egypt and performed wonders and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea and for forty years in the wilderness.
44007037 “This is the Moses who told the Israelites, ‘God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your own people.’
44007038 He was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors; and he received living words to pass on to us.
44007039 “But our ancestors refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt.
44007040 They told Aaron, ‘Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who led us out of Egypt—we don’t know what has happened to him!’
44007041 That was the time they made an idol in the form of a calf. They brought sacrifices to it and reveled in what their own hands had made.
44007042 But God turned away from them and gave them over to the worship of the sun, moon and stars. This agrees with what is written in the book of the prophets: “ ‘Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the wilderness, people of Israel?
44007043 You have taken up the tabernacle of Molek and the star of your god Rephan, the idols you made to worship. Therefore I will send you into exile’ beyond Babylon.
44007044 “Our ancestors had the tabernacle of the covenant law with them in the wilderness. It had been made as God directed Moses, according to the pattern he had seen.
44007045 After receiving the tabernacle, our ancestors under Joshua brought it with them when they took the land from the nations God drove out before them. It remained in the land until the time of David,
44007046 who enjoyed God’s favor and asked that he might provide a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.
44007047 But it was Solomon who built a house for him.
44007048 “However, the Most High does not live in houses made by human hands. As the prophet says:
44007049 “ ‘Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me? says the Lord. Or where will my resting place be?
44007050 Has not my hand made all these things?’
44007051 “You stiff-necked people! Your hearts and ears are still uncircumcised. You are just like your ancestors: You always resist the Holy Spirit!
44007052 Was there ever a prophet your ancestors did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him—
44007053 you who have received the law that was given through angels but have not obeyed it.”
44007054 When the members of the Sanhedrin heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him.
44007055 But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
44007056 “Look,” he said, “I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.”
44007057 At this they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him,
44007058 dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul.
44007059 While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”
44007060 Then he fell on his knees and cried out, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” When he had said this, he fell asleep.
44008001 And Saul approved of their killing him. On that day a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.
44008002 Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him.
44008003 But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison.
44008004 Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went.
44008005 Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah there.
44008006 When the crowds heard Philip and saw the signs he performed, they all paid close attention to what he said.
44008007 For with shrieks, impure spirits came out of many, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed.
44008008 So there was great joy in that city.
44008009 Now for some time a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great,
44008010 and all the people, both high and low, gave him their attention and exclaimed, “This man is rightly called the Great Power of God.”
44008011 They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his sorcery.
44008012 But when they believed Philip as he proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
44008013 Simon himself believed and was baptized. And he followed Philip everywhere, astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw.
44008014 When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to Samaria.
44008015 When they arrived, they prayed for the new believers there that they might receive the Holy Spirit,
44008016 because the Holy Spirit had not yet come on any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
44008017 Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
44008018 When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money
44008019 and said, “Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”
44008020 Peter answered: “May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money!
44008021 You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before God.
44008022 Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord in the hope that he may forgive you for having such a thought in your heart.
44008023 For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin.”
44008024 Then Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me.”
44008025 After they had further proclaimed the word of the Lord and testified about Jesus, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages.
44008026 Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Go south to the road—the desert road—that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.”
44008027 So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of the Kandake (which means “queen of the Ethiopians”). This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship,
44008028 and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the Book of Isaiah the prophet.
44008029 The Spirit told Philip, “Go to that chariot and stay near it.”
44008030 Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. “Do you understand what you are reading?” Philip asked.
44008031 “How can I,” he said, “unless someone explains it to me?” So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
44008032 This is the passage of Scripture the eunuch was reading: “He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth.
44008033 In his humiliation he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth.”
44008034 The eunuch asked Philip, “Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?”
44008035 Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.
44008036 As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, “Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being baptized?”
44008037 
44008038 And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him.
44008039 When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.
44008040 Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.
44009001 Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord’s disciples. He went to the high priest
44009002 and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem.
44009003 As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.
44009004 He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?”
44009005 “Who are you, Lord?” Saul asked. “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,” he replied.
44009006 “Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.”
44009007 The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless; they heard the sound but did not see anyone.
44009008 Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus.
44009009 For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything.
44009010 In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, “Ananias!” “Yes, Lord,” he answered.
44009011 The Lord told him, “Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying.
44009012 In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight.”
44009013 “Lord,” Ananias answered, “I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem.
44009014 And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.”
44009015 But the Lord said to Ananias, “Go! This man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel.
44009016 I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.”
44009017 Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord—Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here—has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”
44009018 Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized,
44009019 and after taking some food, he regained his strength. Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus.
44009020 At once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.
44009021 All those who heard him were astonished and asked, “Isn’t he the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn’t he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?”
44009022 Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Messiah.
44009023 After many days had gone by, there was a conspiracy among the Jews to kill him,
44009024 but Saul learned of their plan. Day and night they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him.
44009025 But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall.
44009026 When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple.
44009027 But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus.
44009028 So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.
44009029 He talked and debated with the Hellenistic Jews, but they tried to kill him.
44009030 When the believers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.
44009031 Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace and was strengthened. Living in the fear of the Lord and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers.
44009032 As Peter traveled about the country, he went to visit the Lord’s people who lived in Lydda.
44009033 There he found a man named Aeneas, who was paralyzed and had been bedridden for eight years.
44009034 “Aeneas,” Peter said to him, “Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and roll up your mat.” Immediately Aeneas got up.
44009035 All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
44009036 In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (in Greek her name is Dorcas); she was always doing good and helping the poor.
44009037 About that time she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room.
44009038 Lydda was near Joppa; so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two men to him and urged him, “Please come at once!”
44009039 Peter went with them, and when he arrived he was taken upstairs to the room. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them.
44009040 Peter sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. Turning toward the dead woman, he said, “Tabitha, get up.” She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up.
44009041 He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called for the believers, especially the widows, and presented her to them alive.
44009042 This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord.
44009043 Peter stayed in Joppa for some time with a tanner named Simon.
44010001 At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment.
44010002 He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly.
44010003 One day at about three in the afternoon he had a vision. He distinctly saw an angel of God, who came to him and said, “Cornelius!”
44010004 Cornelius stared at him in fear. “What is it, Lord?” he asked. The angel answered, “Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God.
44010005 Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter.
44010006 He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.”
44010007 When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants.
44010008 He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa.
44010009 About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray.
44010010 He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance.
44010011 He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners.
44010012 It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles and birds.
44010013 Then a voice told him, “Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.”
44010014 “Surely not, Lord!” Peter replied. “I have never eaten anything impure or unclean.”
44010015 The voice spoke to him a second time, “Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.”
44010016 This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven.
44010017 While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon’s house was and stopped at the gate.
44010018 They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there.
44010019 While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Simon, three men are looking for you.
44010020 So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.”
44010021 Peter went down and said to the men, “I’m the one you’re looking for. Why have you come?”
44010022 The men replied, “We have come from Cornelius the centurion. He is a righteous and God-fearing man, who is respected by all the Jewish people. A holy angel told him to ask you to come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say.”
44010023 Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests. The next day Peter started out with them, and some of the believers from Joppa went along.
44010024 The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
44010025 As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence.
44010026 But Peter made him get up. “Stand up,” he said, “I am only a man myself.”
44010027 While talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people.
44010028 He said to them: “You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile. But God has shown me that I should not call anyone impure or unclean.
44010029 So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?”
44010030 Cornelius answered: “Three days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me
44010031 and said, ‘Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor.
44010032 Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.’
44010033 So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.”
44010034 Then Peter began to speak: “I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism
44010035 but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is right.
44010036 You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, announcing the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.
44010037 You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached—
44010038 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.
44010039 “We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross,
44010040 but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen.
44010041 He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen—by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
44010042 He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead.
44010043 All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”
44010044 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message.
44010045 The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on Gentiles.
44010046 For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said,
44010047 “Surely no one can stand in the way of their being baptized with water. They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.”
44010048 So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.
44011001 The apostles and the believers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
44011002 So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him
44011003 and said, “You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them.”
44011004 Starting from the beginning, Peter told them the whole story:
44011005 “I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was.
44011006 I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles and birds.
44011007 Then I heard a voice telling me, ‘Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.’
44011008 “I replied, ‘Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’
44011009 “The voice spoke from heaven a second time, ‘Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.’
44011010 This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again.
44011011 “Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying.
44011012 The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s house.
44011013 He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say, ‘Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.
44011014 He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.’
44011015 “As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning.
44011016 Then I remembered what the Lord had said: ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’
44011017 So if God gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could stand in God’s way?”
44011018 When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, “So then, even to Gentiles God has granted repentance that leads to life.”
44011019 Now those who had been scattered by the persecution that broke out when Stephen was killed traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, spreading the word only among Jews.
44011020 Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus.
44011021 The Lord’s hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.
44011022 News of this reached the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
44011023 When he arrived and saw what the grace of God had done, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts.
44011024 He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.
44011025 Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,
44011026 and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.
44011027 During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
44011028 One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.)
44011029 The disciples, as each one was able, decided to provide help for the brothers and sisters living in Judea.
44011030 This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.
44012001 It was about this time that King Herod arrested some who belonged to the church, intending to persecute them.
44012002 He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword.
44012003 When he saw that this met with approval among the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. This happened during the Festival of Unleavened Bread.
44012004 After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover.
44012005 So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him.
44012006 The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries stood guard at the entrance.
44012007 Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up. “Quick, get up!” he said, and the chains fell off Peter’s wrists.
44012008 Then the angel said to him, “Put on your clothes and sandals.” And Peter did so. “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me,” the angel told him.
44012009 Peter followed him out of the prison, but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening; he thought he was seeing a vision.
44012010 They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city. It opened for them by itself, and they went through it. When they had walked the length of one street, suddenly the angel left him.
44012011 Then Peter came to himself and said, “Now I know without a doubt that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from Herod’s clutches and from everything the Jewish people were hoping would happen.”
44012012 When this had dawned on him, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people had gathered and were praying.
44012013 Peter knocked at the outer entrance, and a servant named Rhoda came to answer the door.
44012014 When she recognized Peter’s voice, she was so overjoyed she ran back without opening it and exclaimed, “Peter is at the door!”
44012015 “You’re out of your mind,” they told her. When she kept insisting that it was so, they said, “It must be his angel.”
44012016 But Peter kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished.
44012017 Peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet and described how the Lord had brought him out of prison. “Tell James and the other brothers and sisters about this,” he said, and then he left for another place.
44012018 In the morning, there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.
44012019 After Herod had a thorough search made for him and did not find him, he cross-examined the guards and ordered that they be executed. Then Herod went from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.
44012020 He had been quarreling with the people of Tyre and Sidon; they now joined together and sought an audience with him. After securing the support of Blastus, a trusted personal servant of the king, they asked for peace, because they depended on the king’s country for their food supply.
44012021 On the appointed day Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people.
44012022 They shouted, “This is the voice of a god, not of a man.”
44012023 Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.
44012024 But the word of God continued to spread and flourish.
44012025 When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission, they returned from Jerusalem, taking with them John, also called Mark.
44013001 Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch) and Saul.
44013002 While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.”
44013003 So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off.
44013004 The two of them, sent on their way by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus.
44013005 When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. John was with them as their helper.
44013006 They traveled through the whole island until they came to Paphos. There they met a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus,
44013007 who was an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The proconsul, an intelligent man, sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God.
44013008 But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is what his name means) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith.
44013009 Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight at Elymas and said,
44013010 “You are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right! You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery. Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord?
44013011 Now the hand of the Lord is against you. You are going to be blind for a time, not even able to see the light of the sun.” Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
44013012 When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord.
44013013 From Paphos, Paul and his companions sailed to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to return to Jerusalem.
44013014 From Perga they went on to Pisidian Antioch. On the Sabbath they entered the synagogue and sat down.
44013015 After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the leaders of the synagogue sent word to them, saying, “Brothers, if you have a word of exhortation for the people, please speak.”
44013016 Standing up, Paul motioned with his hand and said: “Fellow Israelites and you Gentiles who worship God, listen to me!
44013017 The God of the people of Israel chose our ancestors; he made the people prosper during their stay in Egypt; with mighty power he led them out of that country;
44013018 for about forty years he endured their conduct in the wilderness;
44013019 and he overthrew seven nations in Canaan, giving their land to his people as their inheritance.
44013020 All this took about 450 years. “After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet.
44013021 Then the people asked for a king, and he gave them Saul son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled forty years.
44013022 After removing Saul, he made David their king. God testified concerning him: ‘I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart; he will do everything I want him to do.’
44013023 “From this man’s descendants God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus, as he promised.
44013024 Before the coming of Jesus, John preached repentance and baptism to all the people of Israel.
44013025 As John was completing his work, he said: ‘Who do you suppose I am? I am not the one you are looking for. But there is one coming after me whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.’
44013026 “Fellow children of Abraham and you God-fearing Gentiles, it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent.
44013027 The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath.
44013028 Though they found no proper ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed.
44013029 When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb.
44013030 But God raised him from the dead,
44013031 and for many days he was seen by those who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to our people.
44013032 “We tell you the good news: What God promised our ancestors
44013033 he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm: “ ‘You are my son; today I have become your father.’
44013034 God raised him from the dead so that he will never be subject to decay. As God has said, “ ‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.’
44013035 So it is also stated elsewhere: “ ‘You will not let your holy one see decay.’
44013036 “Now when David had served God’s purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep; he was buried with his ancestors and his body decayed.
44013037 But the one whom God raised from the dead did not see decay.
44013038 “Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.
44013039 Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin, a justification you were not able to obtain under the law of Moses.
44013040 Take care that what the prophets have said does not happen to you:
44013041 “ ‘Look, you scoffers, wonder and perish, for I am going to do something in your days that you would never believe, even if someone told you.’ ”
44013042 As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people invited them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath.
44013043 When the congregation was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.
44013044 On the next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.
44013045 When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy. They began to contradict what Paul was saying and heaped abuse on him.
44013046 Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly: “We had to speak the word of God to you first. Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles.
44013047 For this is what the Lord has commanded us: “ ‘I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.’ ”
44013048 When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed.
44013049 The word of the Lord spread through the whole region.
44013050 But the Jewish leaders incited the God-fearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region.
44013051 So they shook the dust off their feet as a warning to them and went to Iconium.
44013052 And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
44014001 At Iconium Paul and Barnabas went as usual into the Jewish synagogue. There they spoke so effectively that a great number of Jews and Greeks believed.
44014002 But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the other Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.
44014003 So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there, speaking boldly for the Lord, who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to perform signs and wonders.
44014004 The people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, others with the apostles.
44014005 There was a plot afoot among both Gentiles and Jews, together with their leaders, to mistreat them and stone them.
44014006 But they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding country,
44014007 where they continued to preach the gospel.
44014008 In Lystra there sat a man who was lame. He had been that way from birth and had never walked.
44014009 He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed
44014010 and called out, “Stand up on your feet!” At that, the man jumped up and began to walk.
44014011 When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have come down to us in human form!”
44014012 Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker.
44014013 The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them.
44014014 But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting:
44014015 “Friends, why are you doing this? We too are only human, like you. We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in them.
44014016 In the past, he let all nations go their own way.
44014017 Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy.”
44014018 Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them.
44014019 Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.
44014020 But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe.
44014021 They preached the gospel in that city and won a large number of disciples. Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium and Antioch,
44014022 strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain true to the faith. “We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God,” they said.
44014023 Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church and, with prayer and fasting, committed them to the Lord, in whom they had put their trust.
44014024 After going through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia,
44014025 and when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
44014026 From Attalia they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work they had now completed.
44014027 On arriving there, they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done through them and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
44014028 And they stayed there a long time with the disciples.
44015001 Certain people came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the believers: “Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved.”
44015002 This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question.
44015003 The church sent them on their way, and as they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had been converted. This news made all the believers very glad.
44015004 When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders, to whom they reported everything God had done through them.
44015005 Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, “The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to keep the law of Moses.”
44015006 The apostles and elders met to consider this question.
44015007 After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: “Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe.
44015008 God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us.
44015009 He did not discriminate between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith.
44015010 Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of Gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear?
44015011 No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.”
44015012 The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.
44015013 When they finished, James spoke up. “Brothers,” he said, “listen to me.
44015014 Simon has described to us how God first intervened to choose a people for his name from the Gentiles.
44015015 The words of the prophets are in agreement with this, as it is written:
44015016 “ ‘After this I will return and rebuild David’s fallen tent. Its ruins I will rebuild, and I will restore it,
44015017 that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles who bear my name, says the Lord, who does these things’ —
44015018 things known from long ago.
44015019 “It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God.
44015020 Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood.
44015021 For the law of Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.”
44015022 Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, men who were leaders among the believers.
44015023 With them they sent the following letter: The apostles and elders, your brothers, To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: Greetings.
44015024 We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said.
44015025 So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul—
44015026 men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
44015027 Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing.
44015028 It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements:
44015029 You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell.
44015030 So the men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where they gathered the church together and delivered the letter.
44015031 The people read it and were glad for its encouraging message.
44015032 Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the believers.
44015033 After spending some time there, they were sent off by the believers with the blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them.
44015034 
44015035 But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, where they and many others taught and preached the word of the Lord.
44015036 Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us go back and visit the believers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing.”
44015037 Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them,
44015038 but Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work.
44015039 They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus,
44015040 but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the believers to the grace of the Lord.
44015041 He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
44016001 Paul came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy lived, whose mother was Jewish and a believer but whose father was a Greek.
44016002 The believers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him.
44016003 Paul wanted to take him along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
44016004 As they traveled from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey.
44016005 So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers.
44016006 Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia.
44016007 When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to.
44016008 So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas.
44016009 During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.”
44016010 After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
44016011 From Troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, and the next day we went on to Neapolis.
44016012 From there we traveled to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city of that district of Macedonia. And we stayed there several days.
44016013 On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there.
44016014 One of those listening was a woman from the city of Thyatira named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth. She was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul’s message.
44016015 When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her home. “If you consider me a believer in the Lord,” she said, “come and stay at my house.” And she persuaded us.
44016016 Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a female slave who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling.
44016017 She followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved.”
44016018 She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so annoyed that he turned around and said to the spirit, “In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!” At that moment the spirit left her.
44016019 When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities.
44016020 They brought them before the magistrates and said, “These men are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar
44016021 by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.”
44016022 The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods.
44016023 After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully.
44016024 When he received these orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.
44016025 About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.
44016026 Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everyone’s chains came loose.
44016027 The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped.
44016028 But Paul shouted, “Don’t harm yourself! We are all here!”
44016029 The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.
44016030 He then brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”
44016031 They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.”
44016032 Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house.
44016033 At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his household were baptized.
44016034 The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God—he and his whole household.
44016035 When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order: “Release those men.”
44016036 The jailer told Paul, “The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be released. Now you can leave. Go in peace.”
44016037 But Paul said to the officers: “They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out.”
44016038 The officers reported this to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were alarmed.
44016039 They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city.
44016040 After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia’s house, where they met with the brothers and sisters and encouraged them. Then they left.
44017001 When Paul and his companions had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.
44017002 As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
44017003 explaining and proving that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead. “This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah,” he said.
44017004 Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few prominent women.
44017005 But other Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to Jason’s house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd.
44017006 But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other believers before the city officials, shouting: “These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here,
44017007 and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar’s decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.”
44017008 When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil.
44017009 Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go.
44017010 As soon as it was night, the believers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue.
44017011 Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.
44017012 As a result, many of them believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men.
44017013 But when the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, some of them went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up.
44017014 The believers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea.
44017015 Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.
44017016 While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols.
44017017 So he reasoned in the synagogue with both Jews and God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there.
44017018 A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to debate with him. Some of them asked, “What is this babbler trying to say?” Others remarked, “He seems to be advocating foreign gods.” They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.
44017019 Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?
44017020 You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we would like to know what they mean.”
44017021 (All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.)
44017022 Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: “People of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious.
44017023 For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: to an unknown god. So you are ignorant of the very thing you worship—and this is what I am going to proclaim to you.
44017024 “The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by human hands.
44017025 And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything. Rather, he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else.
44017026 From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands.
44017027 God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us.
44017028 ‘For in him we live and move and have our being.’ As some of your own poets have said, ‘We are his offspring.’
44017029 “Therefore since we are God’s offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone—an image made by human design and skill.
44017030 In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.
44017031 For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.”
44017032 When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, “We want to hear you again on this subject.”
44017033 At that, Paul left the Council.
44017034 Some of the people became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.
44018001 After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.
44018002 There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them,
44018003 and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them.
44018004 Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.
44018005 When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.
44018006 But when they opposed Paul and became abusive, he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent of it. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”
44018007 Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, a worshiper of God.
44018008 Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptized.
44018009 One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: “Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent.
44018010 For I am with you, and no one is going to attack and harm you, because I have many people in this city.”
44018011 So Paul stayed in Corinth for a year and a half, teaching them the word of God.
44018012 While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews of Corinth made a united attack on Paul and brought him to the place of judgment.
44018013 “This man,” they charged, “is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law.”
44018014 Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to them, “If you Jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime, it would be reasonable for me to listen to you.
44018015 But since it involves questions about words and names and your own law—settle the matter yourselves. I will not be a judge of such things.”
44018016 So he drove them off.
44018017 Then the crowd there turned on Sosthenes the synagogue leader and beat him in front of the proconsul; and Gallio showed no concern whatever.
44018018 Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and sisters and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before he sailed, he had his hair cut off at Cenchreae because of a vow he had taken.
44018019 They arrived at Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
44018020 When they asked him to spend more time with them, he declined.
44018021 But as he left, he promised, “I will come back if it is God’s will.” Then he set sail from Ephesus.
44018022 When he landed at Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church and then went down to Antioch.
44018023 After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out from there and traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
44018024 Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures.
44018025 He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great fervor and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John.
44018026 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately.
44018027 When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers and sisters encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. When he arrived, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed.
44018028 For he vigorously refuted his Jewish opponents in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.
44019001 While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples
44019002 and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” They answered, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”
44019003 So Paul asked, “Then what baptism did you receive?” “John’s baptism,” they replied.
44019004 Paul said, “John’s baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.”
44019005 On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
44019006 When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.
44019007 There were about twelve men in all.
44019008 Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God.
44019009 But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.
44019010 This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord.
44019011 God did extraordinary miracles through Paul,
44019012 so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them.
44019013 Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, “In the name of the Jesus whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out.”
44019014 Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.
44019015 One day the evil spirit answered them, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know about, but who are you?”
44019016 Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding.
44019017 When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor.
44019018 Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed what they had done.
44019019 A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas.
44019020 In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power.
44019021 After all this had happened, Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. “After I have been there,” he said, “I must visit Rome also.”
44019022 He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed in the province of Asia a little longer.
44019023 About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way.
44019024 A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in a lot of business for the craftsmen there.
44019025 He called them together, along with the workers in related trades, and said: “You know, my friends, that we receive a good income from this business.
44019026 And you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that gods made by human hands are no gods at all.
44019027 There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited; and the goddess herself, who is worshiped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will be robbed of her divine majesty.”
44019028 When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
44019029 Soon the whole city was in an uproar. The people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul’s traveling companions from Macedonia, and all of them rushed into the theater together.
44019030 Paul wanted to appear before the crowd, but the disciples would not let him.
44019031 Even some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theater.
44019032 The assembly was in confusion: Some were shouting one thing, some another. Most of the people did not even know why they were there.
44019033 The Jews in the crowd pushed Alexander to the front, and they shouted instructions to him. He motioned for silence in order to make a defense before the people.
44019034 But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
44019035 The city clerk quieted the crowd and said: “Fellow Ephesians, doesn’t all the world know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven?
44019036 Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to calm down and not do anything rash.
44019037 You have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess.
44019038 If, then, Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anybody, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They can press charges.
44019039 If there is anything further you want to bring up, it must be settled in a legal assembly.
44019040 As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of what happened today. In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it.”
44019041 After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.
44020001 When the uproar had ended, Paul sent for the disciples and, after encouraging them, said goodbye and set out for Macedonia.
44020002 He traveled through that area, speaking many words of encouragement to the people, and finally arrived in Greece,
44020003 where he stayed three months. Because some Jews had plotted against him just as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to go back through Macedonia.
44020004 He was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy also, and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia.
44020005 These men went on ahead and waited for us at Troas.
44020006 But we sailed from Philippi after the Festival of Unleavened Bread, and five days later joined the others at Troas, where we stayed seven days.
44020007 On the first day of the week we came together to break bread. Paul spoke to the people and, because he intended to leave the next day, kept on talking until midnight.
44020008 There were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting.
44020009 Seated in a window was a young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on. When he was sound asleep, he fell to the ground from the third story and was picked up dead.
44020010 Paul went down, threw himself on the young man and put his arms around him. “Don’t be alarmed,” he said. “He’s alive!”
44020011 Then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate. After talking until daylight, he left.
44020012 The people took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted.
44020013 We went on ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we were going to take Paul aboard. He had made this arrangement because he was going there on foot.
44020014 When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard and went on to Mitylene.
44020015 The next day we set sail from there and arrived off Chios. The day after that we crossed over to Samos, and on the following day arrived at Miletus.
44020016 Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of Asia, for he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost.
44020017 From Miletus, Paul sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church.
44020018 When they arrived, he said to them: “You know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I came into the province of Asia.
44020019 I served the Lord with great humility and with tears and in the midst of severe testing by the plots of my Jewish opponents.
44020020 You know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house.
44020021 I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus.
44020022 “And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there.
44020023 I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me.
44020024 However, I consider my life worth nothing to me; my only aim is to finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me—the task of testifying to the good news of God’s grace.
44020025 “Now I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see me again.
44020026 Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of any of you.
44020027 For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God.
44020028 Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood.
44020029 I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock.
44020030 Even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them.
44020031 So be on your guard! Remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears.
44020032 “Now I commit you to God and to the word of his grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
44020033 I have not coveted anyone’s silver or gold or clothing.
44020034 You yourselves know that these hands of mine have supplied my own needs and the needs of my companions.
44020035 In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ ”
44020036 When Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down with all of them and prayed.
44020037 They all wept as they embraced him and kissed him.
44020038 What grieved them most was his statement that they would never see his face again. Then they accompanied him to the ship.
44021001 After we had torn ourselves away from them, we put out to sea and sailed straight to Kos. The next day we went to Rhodes and from there to Patara.
44021002 We found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, went on board and set sail.
44021003 After sighting Cyprus and passing to the south of it, we sailed on to Syria. We landed at Tyre, where our ship was to unload its cargo.
44021004 We sought out the disciples there and stayed with them seven days. Through the Spirit they urged Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.
44021005 When it was time to leave, we left and continued on our way. All of them, including wives and children, accompanied us out of the city, and there on the beach we knelt to pray.
44021006 After saying goodbye to each other, we went aboard the ship, and they returned home.
44021007 We continued our voyage from Tyre and landed at Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and sisters and stayed with them for a day.
44021008 Leaving the next day, we reached Caesarea and stayed at the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the Seven.
44021009 He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.
44021010 After we had been there a number of days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
44021011 Coming over to us, he took Paul’s belt, tied his own hands and feet with it and said, “The Holy Spirit says, ‘In this way the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and will hand him over to the Gentiles.’ ”
44021012 When we heard this, we and the people there pleaded with Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.
44021013 Then Paul answered, “Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”
44021014 When he would not be dissuaded, we gave up and said, “The Lord’s will be done.”
44021015 After this, we started on our way up to Jerusalem.
44021016 Some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us and brought us to the home of Mnason, where we were to stay. He was a man from Cyprus and one of the early disciples.
44021017 When we arrived at Jerusalem, the brothers and sisters received us warmly.
44021018 The next day Paul and the rest of us went to see James, and all the elders were present.
44021019 Paul greeted them and reported in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
44021020 When they heard this, they praised God. Then they said to Paul: “You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed, and all of them are zealous for the law.
44021021 They have been informed that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to turn away from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or live according to our customs.
44021022 What shall we do? They will certainly hear that you have come,
44021023 so do what we tell you. There are four men with us who have made a vow.
44021024 Take these men, join in their purification rites and pay their expenses, so that they can have their heads shaved. Then everyone will know there is no truth in these reports about you, but that you yourself are living in obedience to the law.
44021025 As for the Gentile believers, we have written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality.”
44021026 The next day Paul took the men and purified himself along with them. Then he went to the temple to give notice of the date when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each of them.
44021027 When the seven days were nearly over, some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul at the temple. They stirred up the whole crowd and seized him,
44021028 shouting, “Fellow Israelites, help us! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people and our law and this place. And besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place.”
44021029 (They had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul and assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple.)
44021030 The whole city was aroused, and the people came running from all directions. Seizing Paul, they dragged him from the temple, and immediately the gates were shut.
44021031 While they were trying to kill him, news reached the commander of the Roman troops that the whole city of Jerusalem was in an uproar.
44021032 He at once took some officers and soldiers and ran down to the crowd. When the rioters saw the commander and his soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
44021033 The commander came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done.
44021034 Some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another, and since the commander could not get at the truth because of the uproar, he ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks.
44021035 When Paul reached the steps, the violence of the mob was so great he had to be carried by the soldiers.
44021036 The crowd that followed kept shouting, “Get rid of him!”
44021037 As the soldiers were about to take Paul into the barracks, he asked the commander, “May I say something to you?” “Do you speak Greek?” he replied.
44021038 “Aren’t you the Egyptian who started a revolt and led four thousand terrorists out into the wilderness some time ago?”
44021039 Paul answered, “I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city. Please let me speak to the people.”
44021040 After receiving the commander’s permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the crowd. When they were all silent, he said to them in Aramaic :
44022001 “Brothers and fathers, listen now to my defense.”
44022002 When they heard him speak to them in Aramaic, they became very quiet. Then Paul said:
44022003 “I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city. I studied under Gamaliel and was thoroughly trained in the law of our ancestors. I was just as zealous for God as any of you are today.
44022004 I persecuted the followers of this Way to their death, arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison,
44022005 as the high priest and all the Council can themselves testify. I even obtained letters from them to their associates in Damascus, and went there to bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished.
44022006 “About noon as I came near Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me.
44022007 I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, ‘Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?’
44022008 “ ‘Who are you, Lord?’ I asked. “ ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting,’ he replied.
44022009 My companions saw the light, but they did not understand the voice of him who was speaking to me.
44022010 “ ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ I asked. “ ‘Get up,’ the Lord said, ‘and go into Damascus. There you will be told all that you have been assigned to do.’
44022011 My companions led me by the hand into Damascus, because the brilliance of the light had blinded me.
44022012 “A man named Ananias came to see me. He was a devout observer of the law and highly respected by all the Jews living there.
44022013 He stood beside me and said, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ And at that very moment I was able to see him.
44022014 “Then he said: ‘The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth.
44022015 You will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard.
44022016 And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name.’
44022017 “When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple, I fell into a trance
44022018 and saw the Lord speaking to me. ‘Quick!’ he said. ‘Leave Jerusalem immediately, because the people here will not accept your testimony about me.’
44022019 “ ‘Lord,’ I replied, ‘these people know that I went from one synagogue to another to imprison and beat those who believe in you.
44022020 And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I stood there giving my approval and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.’
44022021 “Then the Lord said to me, ‘Go; I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’ ”
44022022 The crowd listened to Paul until he said this. Then they raised their voices and shouted, “Rid the earth of him! He’s not fit to live!”
44022023 As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air,
44022024 the commander ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks. He directed that he be flogged and interrogated in order to find out why the people were shouting at him like this.
44022025 As they stretched him out to flog him, Paul said to the centurion standing there, “Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn’t even been found guilty?”
44022026 When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported it. “What are you going to do?” he asked. “This man is a Roman citizen.”
44022027 The commander went to Paul and asked, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” “Yes, I am,” he answered.
44022028 Then the commander said, “I had to pay a lot of money for my citizenship.” “But I was born a citizen,” Paul replied.
44022029 Those who were about to interrogate him withdrew immediately. The commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put Paul, a Roman citizen, in chains.
44022030 The commander wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews. So the next day he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the members of the Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he brought Paul and had him stand before them.
44023001 Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said, “My brothers, I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day.”
44023002 At this the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth.
44023003 Then Paul said to him, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck!”
44023004 Those who were standing near Paul said, “How dare you insult God’s high priest!”
44023005 Paul replied, “Brothers, I did not realize that he was the high priest; for it is written: ‘Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.’ ”
44023006 Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin, “My brothers, I am a Pharisee, descended from Pharisees. I stand on trial because of the hope of the resurrection of the dead.”
44023007 When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
44023008 (The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, and that there are neither angels nor spirits, but the Pharisees believe all these things.)
44023009 There was a great uproar, and some of the teachers of the law who were Pharisees stood up and argued vigorously. “We find nothing wrong with this man,” they said. “What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?”
44023010 The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them. He ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force and bring him into the barracks.
44023011 The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, “Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.”
44023012 The next morning some Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.
44023013 More than forty men were involved in this plot.
44023014 They went to the chief priests and the elders and said, “We have taken a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul.
44023015 Now then, you and the Sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him before you on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about his case. We are ready to kill him before he gets here.”
44023016 But when the son of Paul’s sister heard of this plot, he went into the barracks and told Paul.
44023017 Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the commander; he has something to tell him.”
44023018 So he took him to the commander. The centurion said, “Paul, the prisoner, sent for me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.”
44023019 The commander took the young man by the hand, drew him aside and asked, “What is it you want to tell me?”
44023020 He said: “Some Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul before the Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about him.
44023021 Don’t give in to them, because more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now, waiting for your consent to their request.”
44023022 The commander dismissed the young man with this warning: “Don’t tell anyone that you have reported this to me.”
44023023 Then he called two of his centurions and ordered them, “Get ready a detachment of two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at nine tonight.
44023024 Provide horses for Paul so that he may be taken safely to Governor Felix.”
44023025 He wrote a letter as follows:
44023026 Claudius Lysias, To His Excellency, Governor Felix: Greetings.
44023027 This man was seized by the Jews and they were about to kill him, but I came with my troops and rescued him, for I had learned that he is a Roman citizen.
44023028 I wanted to know why they were accusing him, so I brought him to their Sanhedrin.
44023029 I found that the accusation had to do with questions about their law, but there was no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment.
44023030 When I was informed of a plot to be carried out against the man, I sent him to you at once. I also ordered his accusers to present to you their case against him.
44023031 So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul with them during the night and brought him as far as Antipatris.
44023032 The next day they let the cavalry go on with him, while they returned to the barracks.
44023033 When the cavalry arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him.
44023034 The governor read the letter and asked what province he was from. Learning that he was from Cilicia,
44023035 he said, “I will hear your case when your accusers get here.” Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod’s palace.
44024001 Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor.
44024002 When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented his case before Felix: “We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation.
44024003 Everywhere and in every way, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with profound gratitude.
44024004 But in order not to weary you further, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly.
44024005 “We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect
44024006 and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him.
44024007 
44024008 By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him.”
44024009 The other Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true.
44024010 When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: “I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my defense.
44024011 You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
44024012 My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city.
44024013 And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me.
44024014 However, I admit that I worship the God of our ancestors as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets,
44024015 and I have the same hope in God as these men themselves have, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.
44024016 So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.
44024017 “After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings.
44024018 I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance.
44024019 But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me.
44024020 Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin—
44024021 unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence: ‘It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’ ”
44024022 Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. “When Lysias the commander comes,” he said, “I will decide your case.”
44024023 He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs.
44024024 Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus.
44024025 As Paul talked about righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, “That’s enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you.”
44024026 At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him.
44024027 When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, he left Paul in prison.
44025001 Three days after arriving in the province, Festus went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem,
44025002 where the chief priests and the Jewish leaders appeared before him and presented the charges against Paul.
44025003 They requested Festus, as a favor to them, to have Paul transferred to Jerusalem, for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way.
44025004 Festus answered, “Paul is being held at Caesarea, and I myself am going there soon.
44025005 Let some of your leaders come with me, and if the man has done anything wrong, they can press charges against him there.”
44025006 After spending eight or ten days with them, Festus went down to Caesarea. The next day he convened the court and ordered that Paul be brought before him.
44025007 When Paul came in, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him. They brought many serious charges against him, but they could not prove them.
44025008 Then Paul made his defense: “I have done nothing wrong against the Jewish law or against the temple or against Caesar.”
44025009 Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there on these charges?”
44025010 Paul answered: “I am now standing before Caesar’s court, where I ought to be tried. I have not done any wrong to the Jews, as you yourself know very well.
44025011 If, however, I am guilty of doing anything deserving death, I do not refuse to die. But if the charges brought against me by these Jews are not true, no one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!”
44025012 After Festus had conferred with his council, he declared: “You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you will go!”
44025013 A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.
44025014 Since they were spending many days there, Festus discussed Paul’s case with the king. He said: “There is a man here whom Felix left as a prisoner.
44025015 When I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him and asked that he be condemned.
44025016 “I told them that it is not the Roman custom to hand over anyone before they have faced their accusers and have had an opportunity to defend themselves against the charges.
44025017 When they came here with me, I did not delay the case, but convened the court the next day and ordered the man to be brought in.
44025018 When his accusers got up to speak, they did not charge him with any of the crimes I had expected.
44025019 Instead, they had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man named Jesus who Paul claimed was alive.
44025020 I was at a loss how to investigate such matters; so I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and stand trial there on these charges.
44025021 But when Paul made his appeal to be held over for the Emperor’s decision, I ordered him held until I could send him to Caesar.”
44025022 Then Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to hear this man myself.” He replied, “Tomorrow you will hear him.”
44025023 The next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the high-ranking military officers and the prominent men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.
44025024 Festus said: “King Agrippa, and all who are present with us, you see this man! The whole Jewish community has petitioned me about him in Jerusalem and here in Caesarea, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.
44025025 I found he had done nothing deserving of death, but because he made his appeal to the Emperor I decided to send him to Rome.
44025026 But I have nothing definite to write to His Majesty about him. Therefore I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that as a result of this investigation I may have something to write.
44025027 For I think it is unreasonable to send a prisoner on to Rome without specifying the charges against him.”
44026001 Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.” So Paul motioned with his hand and began his defense:
44026002 “King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today as I make my defense against all the accusations of the Jews,
44026003 and especially so because you are well acquainted with all the Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently.
44026004 “The Jewish people all know the way I have lived ever since I was a child, from the beginning of my life in my own country, and also in Jerusalem.
44026005 They have known me for a long time and can testify, if they are willing, that I conformed to the strictest sect of our religion, living as a Pharisee.
44026006 And now it is because of my hope in what God has promised our ancestors that I am on trial today.
44026007 This is the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve God day and night. King Agrippa, it is because of this hope that these Jews are accusing me.
44026008 Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead?
44026009 “I too was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
44026010 And that is just what I did in Jerusalem. On the authority of the chief priests I put many of the Lord’s people in prison, and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.
44026011 Many a time I went from one synagogue to another to have them punished, and I tried to force them to blaspheme. I was so obsessed with persecuting them that I even hunted them down in foreign cities.
44026012 “On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.
44026013 About noon, King Agrippa, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, blazing around me and my companions.
44026014 We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’
44026015 “Then I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ “ ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,’ the Lord replied.
44026016 ‘Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen and will see of me.
44026017 I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them
44026018 to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’
44026019 “So then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the vision from heaven.
44026020 First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and then to the Gentiles, I preached that they should repent and turn to God and demonstrate their repentance by their deeds.
44026021 That is why some Jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me.
44026022 But God has helped me to this very day; so I stand here and testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen—
44026023 that the Messiah would suffer and, as the first to rise from the dead, would bring the message of light to his own people and to the Gentiles.”
44026024 At this point Festus interrupted Paul’s defense. “You are out of your mind, Paul!” he shouted. “Your great learning is driving you insane.”
44026025 “I am not insane, most excellent Festus,” Paul replied. “What I am saying is true and reasonable.
44026026 The king is familiar with these things, and I can speak freely to him. I am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice, because it was not done in a corner.
44026027 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do.”
44026028 Then Agrippa said to Paul, “Do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a Christian?”
44026029 Paul replied, “Short time or long—I pray to God that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what I am, except for these chains.”
44026030 The king rose, and with him the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them.
44026031 After they left the room, they began saying to one another, “This man is not doing anything that deserves death or imprisonment.”
44026032 Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.”
44027001 When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the Imperial Regiment.
44027002 We boarded a ship from Adramyttium about to sail for ports along the coast of the province of Asia, and we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us.
44027003 The next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, in kindness to Paul, allowed him to go to his friends so they might provide for his needs.
44027004 From there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us.
44027005 When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.
44027006 There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board.
44027007 We made slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus. When the wind did not allow us to hold our course, we sailed to the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.
44027008 We moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.
44027009 Much time had been lost, and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the Day of Atonement. So Paul warned them,
44027010 “Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo, and to our own lives also.”
44027011 But the centurion, instead of listening to what Paul said, followed the advice of the pilot and of the owner of the ship.
44027012 Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided that we should sail on, hoping to reach Phoenix and winter there. This was a harbor in Crete, facing both southwest and northwest.
44027013 When a gentle south wind began to blow, they saw their opportunity; so they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete.
44027014 Before very long, a wind of hurricane force, called the Northeaster, swept down from the island.
44027015 The ship was caught by the storm and could not head into the wind; so we gave way to it and were driven along.
44027016 As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure,
44027017 so the men hoisted it aboard. Then they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together. Because they were afraid they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven along.
44027018 We took such a violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard.
44027019 On the third day, they threw the ship’s tackle overboard with their own hands.
44027020 When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging, we finally gave up all hope of being saved.
44027021 After they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up before them and said: “Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss.
44027022 But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be destroyed.
44027023 Last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood beside me
44027024 and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar; and God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.’
44027025 So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me.
44027026 Nevertheless, we must run aground on some island.”
44027027 On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the Adriatic Sea, when about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land.
44027028 They took soundings and found that the water was a hundred and twenty feet deep. A short time later they took soundings again and found it was ninety feet deep.
44027029 Fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight.
44027030 In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow.
44027031 Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved.”
44027032 So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it drift away.
44027033 Just before dawn Paul urged them all to eat. “For the last fourteen days,” he said, “you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food—you haven’t eaten anything.
44027034 Now I urge you to take some food. You need it to survive. Not one of you will lose a single hair from his head.”
44027035 After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat.
44027036 They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves.
44027037 Altogether there were 276 of us on board.
44027038 When they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.
44027039 When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could.
44027040 Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach.
44027041 But the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf.
44027042 The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping.
44027043 But the centurion wanted to spare Paul’s life and kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land.
44027044 The rest were to get there on planks or on other pieces of the ship. In this way everyone reached land safely.
44028001 Once safely on shore, we found out that the island was called Malta.
44028002 The islanders showed us unusual kindness. They built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold.
44028003 Paul gathered a pile of brushwood and, as he put it on the fire, a viper, driven out by the heat, fastened itself on his hand.
44028004 When the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to each other, “This man must be a murderer; for though he escaped from the sea, the goddess Justice has not allowed him to live.”
44028005 But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no ill effects.
44028006 The people expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead; but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.
44028007 There was an estate nearby that belonged to Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed us to his home and showed us generous hospitality for three days.
44028008 His father was sick in bed, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and, after prayer, placed his hands on him and healed him.
44028009 When this had happened, the rest of the sick on the island came and were cured.
44028010 They honored us in many ways; and when we were ready to sail, they furnished us with the supplies we needed.
44028011 After three months we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered in the island—it was an Alexandrian ship with the figurehead of the twin gods Castor and Pollux.
44028012 We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days.
44028013 From there we set sail and arrived at Rhegium. The next day the south wind came up, and on the following day we reached Puteoli.
44028014 There we found some brothers and sisters who invited us to spend a week with them. And so we came to Rome.
44028015 The brothers and sisters there had heard that we were coming, and they traveled as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At the sight of these people Paul thanked God and was encouraged.
44028016 When we got to Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, with a soldier to guard him.
44028017 Three days later he called together the local Jewish leaders. When they had assembled, Paul said to them: “My brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or against the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.
44028018 They examined me and wanted to release me, because I was not guilty of any crime deserving death.
44028019 The Jews objected, so I was compelled to make an appeal to Caesar. I certainly did not intend to bring any charge against my own people.
44028020 For this reason I have asked to see you and talk with you. It is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.”
44028021 They replied, “We have not received any letters from Judea concerning you, and none of our people who have come from there has reported or said anything bad about you.
44028022 But we want to hear what your views are, for we know that people everywhere are talking against this sect.”
44028023 They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, and came in even larger numbers to the place where he was staying. He witnessed to them from morning till evening, explaining about the kingdom of God, and from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets he tried to persuade them about Jesus.
44028024 Some were convinced by what he said, but others would not believe.
44028025 They disagreed among themselves and began to leave after Paul had made this final statement: “The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your ancestors when he said through Isaiah the prophet:
44028026 “ ‘Go to this people and say, “You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.”
44028027 For this people’s heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.’
44028028 “Therefore I want you to know that God’s salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!”
44028029 
44028030 For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him.
44028031 He proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ—with all boldness and without hindrance!
45001001 Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God—
45001002 the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures
45001003 regarding his Son, who as to his earthly life was a descendant of David,
45001004 and who through the Spirit of holiness was appointed the Son of God in power by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord.
45001005 Through him we received grace and apostleship to call all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith for his name’s sake.
45001006 And you also are among those Gentiles who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.
45001007 To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be his holy people: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
45001008 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world.
45001009 God, whom I serve in my spirit in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you
45001010 in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God’s will the way may be opened for me to come to you.
45001011 I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong—
45001012 that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith.
45001013 I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.
45001014 I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.
45001015 That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome.
45001016 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.
45001017 For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.”
45001018 The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness,
45001019 since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.
45001020 For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.
45001021 For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.
45001022 Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools
45001023 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.
45001024 Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.
45001025 They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.
45001026 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones.
45001027 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.
45001028 Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done.
45001029 They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips,
45001030 slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents;
45001031 they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy.
45001032 Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.
45002001 You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge another, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.
45002002 Now we know that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth.
45002003 So when you, a mere human being, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God’s judgment?
45002004 Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?
45002005 But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God’s wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed.
45002006 God “will repay each person according to what they have done.”
45002007 To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.
45002008 But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger.
45002009 There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile;
45002010 but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.
45002011 For God does not show favoritism.
45002012 All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.
45002013 For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God’s sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.
45002014 (Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law.
45002015 They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.)
45002016 This will take place on the day when God judges people’s secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.
45002017 Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and boast in God;
45002018 if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law;
45002019 if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in the dark,
45002020 an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of little children, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—
45002021 you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?
45002022 You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
45002023 You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?
45002024 As it is written: “God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”
45002025 Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised.
45002026 So then, if those who are not circumcised keep the law’s requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised?
45002027 The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.
45002028 A person is not a Jew who is one only outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical.
45002029 No, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a person’s praise is not from other people, but from God.
45003001 What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew, or what value is there in circumcision?
45003002 Much in every way! First of all, the Jews have been entrusted with the very words of God.
45003003 What if some were unfaithful? Will their unfaithfulness nullify God’s faithfulness?
45003004 Not at all! Let God be true, and every human being a liar. As it is written: “So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge.”
45003005 But if our unrighteousness brings out God’s righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.)
45003006 Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world?
45003007 Someone might argue, “If my falsehood enhances God’s truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?”
45003008 Why not say—as some slanderously claim that we say—“Let us do evil that good may result”? Their condemnation is just!
45003009 What shall we conclude then? Do we have any advantage? Not at all! For we have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin.
45003010 As it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one;
45003011 there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God.
45003012 All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.”
45003013 “Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.” “The poison of vipers is on their lips.”
45003014 “Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.”
45003015 “Their feet are swift to shed blood;
45003016 ruin and misery mark their ways,
45003017 and the way of peace they do not know.”
45003018 “There is no fear of God before their eyes.”
45003019 Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.
45003020 Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.
45003021 But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify.
45003022 This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile,
45003023 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
45003024 and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.
45003025 God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished—
45003026 he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.
45003027 Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith.
45003028 For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.
45003029 Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too,
45003030 since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith.
45003031 Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.
45004001 What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, discovered in this matter?
45004002 If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about—but not before God.
45004003 What does Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”
45004004 Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation.
45004005 However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness.
45004006 David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:
45004007 “Blessed are those whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.
45004008 Blessed is the one whose sin the Lord will never count against them.”
45004009 Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham’s faith was credited to him as righteousness.
45004010 Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before!
45004011 And he received circumcision as a sign, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them.
45004012 And he is then also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.
45004013 It was not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.
45004014 For if those who depend on the law are heirs, faith means nothing and the promise is worthless,
45004015 because the law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression.
45004016 Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham’s offspring—not only to those who are of the law but also to those who have the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all.
45004017 As it is written: “I have made you a father of many nations.” He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed—the God who gives life to the dead and calls into being things that were not.
45004018 Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, “So shall your offspring be.”
45004019 Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead—since he was about a hundred years old—and that Sarah’s womb was also dead.
45004020 Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,
45004021 being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.
45004022 This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.”
45004023 The words “it was credited to him” were written not for him alone,
45004024 but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness—for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.
45004025 He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.
45005001 Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
45005002 through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we boast in the hope of the glory of God.
45005003 Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance;
45005004 perseverance, character; and character, hope.
45005005 And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.
45005006 You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.
45005007 Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die.
45005008 But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
45005009 Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God’s wrath through him!
45005010 For if, while we were God’s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!
45005011 Not only is this so, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.
45005012 Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned—
45005013 To be sure, sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not charged against anyone’s account where there is no law.
45005014 Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who is a pattern of the one to come.
45005015 But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God’s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!
45005016 Nor can the gift of God be compared with the result of one man’s sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification.
45005017 For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God’s abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!
45005018 Consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people.
45005019 For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.
45005020 The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more,
45005021 so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
45006001 What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase?
45006002 By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?
45006003 Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
45006004 We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.
45006005 For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his.
45006006 For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin—
45006007 because anyone who has died has been set free from sin.
45006008 Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.
45006009 For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him.
45006010 The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.
45006011 In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
45006012 Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires.
45006013 Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness.
45006014 For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace.
45006015 What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? By no means!
45006016 Don’t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey—whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness?
45006017 But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance.
45006018 You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.
45006019 I am using an example from everyday life because of your human limitations. Just as you used to offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer yourselves as slaves to righteousness leading to holiness.
45006020 When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness.
45006021 What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death!
45006022 But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life.
45006023 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
45007001 Do you not know, brothers and sisters—for I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law has authority over someone only as long as that person lives?
45007002 For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law that binds her to him.
45007003 So then, if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man.
45007004 So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God.
45007005 For when we were in the realm of the flesh, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us, so that we bore fruit for death.
45007006 But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.
45007007 What shall we say, then? Is the law sinful? Certainly not! Nevertheless, I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.”
45007008 But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of coveting. For apart from the law, sin was dead.
45007009 Once I was alive apart from the law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.
45007010 I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.
45007011 For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death.
45007012 So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good.
45007013 Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! Nevertheless, in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it used what is good to bring about my death, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.
45007014 We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.
45007015 I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.
45007016 And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.
45007017 As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.
45007018 For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.
45007019 For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing.
45007020 Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.
45007021 So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me.
45007022 For in my inner being I delight in God’s law;
45007023 but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me.
45007024 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death?
45007025 Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.
45008001 Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,
45008002 because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.
45008003 For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in the flesh,
45008004 in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
45008005 Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires.
45008006 The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace.
45008007 The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so.
45008008 Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God.
45008009 You, however, are not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ.
45008010 But if Christ is in you, then even though your body is subject to death because of sin, the Spirit gives life because of righteousness.
45008011 And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his Spirit who lives in you.
45008012 Therefore, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation—but it is not to the flesh, to live according to it.
45008013 For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live.
45008014 For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God.
45008015 The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship. And by him we cry, “Abba, Father.”
45008016 The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children.
45008017 Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.
45008018 I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.
45008019 For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.
45008020 For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope
45008021 that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God.
45008022 We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.
45008023 Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship, the redemption of our bodies.
45008024 For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what they already have?
45008025 But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.
45008026 In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans.
45008027 And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God’s people in accordance with the will of God.
45008028 And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.
45008029 For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.
45008030 And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.
45008031 What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?
45008032 He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?
45008033 Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies.
45008034 Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.
45008035 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
45008036 As it is written: “For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.”
45008037 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
45008038 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,
45008039 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
45009001 I speak the truth in Christ—I am not lying, my conscience confirms it through the Holy Spirit—
45009002 I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.
45009003 For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my people, those of my own race,
45009004 the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption to sonship; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises.
45009005 Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of the Messiah, who is God over all, forever praised! Amen.
45009006 It is not as though God’s word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.
45009007 Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham’s children. On the contrary, “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.”
45009008 In other words, it is not the children by physical descent who are God’s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham’s offspring.
45009009 For this was how the promise was stated: “At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”
45009010 Not only that, but Rebekah’s children were conceived at the same time by our father Isaac.
45009011 Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad—in order that God’s purpose in election might stand:
45009012 not by works but by him who calls—she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”
45009013 Just as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”
45009014 What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all!
45009015 For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”
45009016 It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.
45009017 For Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”
45009018 Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden.
45009019 One of you will say to me: “Then why does God still blame us? For who is able to resist his will?”
45009020 But who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? “Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’ ”
45009021 Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use?
45009022 What if God, although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath—prepared for destruction?
45009023 What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory—
45009024 even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?
45009025 As he says in Hosea: “I will call them ‘my people’ who are not my people; and I will call her ‘my loved one’ who is not my loved one,”
45009026 and, “In the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ there they will be called ‘children of the living God.’ ”
45009027 Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved.
45009028 For the Lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality.”
45009029 It is just as Isaiah said previously: “Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.”
45009030 What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith;
45009031 but the people of Israel, who pursued the law as the way of righteousness, have not attained their goal.
45009032 Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone.
45009033 As it is written: “See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall, and the one who believes in him will never be put to shame.”
45010001 Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved.
45010002 For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge.
45010003 Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness.
45010004 Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.
45010005 Moses writes this about the righteousness that is by the law: “The person who does these things will live by them.”
45010006 But the righteousness that is by faith says: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ down)
45010007 “or ‘Who will descend into the deep?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).
45010008 But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,” that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim:
45010009 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
45010010 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.
45010011 As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.”
45010012 For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him,
45010013 for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”
45010014 How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?
45010015 And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”
45010016 But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our message?”
45010017 Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ.
45010018 But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did: “Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.”
45010019 Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says, “I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding.”
45010020 And Isaiah boldly says, “I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.”
45010021 But concerning Israel he says, “All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people.”
45011001 I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.
45011002 God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don’t you know what Scripture says in the passage about Elijah—how he appealed to God against Israel:
45011003 “Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me” ?
45011004 And what was God’s answer to him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”
45011005 So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.
45011006 And if by grace, then it cannot be based on works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace.
45011007 What then? What the people of Israel sought so earnestly they did not obtain. The elect among them did, but the others were hardened,
45011008 as it is written: “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that could not see and ears that could not hear, to this very day.”
45011009 And David says: “May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them.
45011010 May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.”
45011011 Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious.
45011012 But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their full inclusion bring!
45011013 I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I take pride in my ministry
45011014 in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them.
45011015 For if their rejection brought reconciliation to the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?
45011016 If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches.
45011017 If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root,
45011018 do not consider yourself to be superior to those other branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.
45011019 You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.”
45011020 Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but tremble.
45011021 For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.
45011022 Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off.
45011023 And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.
45011024 After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!
45011025 I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in,
45011026 and in this way all Israel will be saved. As it is written: “The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob.
45011027 And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins.”
45011028 As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies for your sake; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs,
45011029 for God’s gifts and his call are irrevocable.
45011030 Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience,
45011031 so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God’s mercy to you.
45011032 For God has bound everyone over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.
45011033 Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!
45011034 “Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?”
45011035 “Who has ever given to God, that God should repay them?”
45011036 For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.
45012001 Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship.
45012002 Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.
45012003 For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you.
45012004 For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function,
45012005 so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.
45012006 We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your faith;
45012007 if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach;
45012008 if it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead, do it diligently; if it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully.
45012009 Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.
45012010 Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves.
45012011 Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord.
45012012 Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.
45012013 Share with the Lord’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality.
45012014 Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.
45012015 Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn.
45012016 Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceited.
45012017 Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone.
45012018 If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.
45012019 Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” says the Lord.
45012020 On the contrary: “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.”
45012021 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
45013001 Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.
45013002 Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.
45013003 For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended.
45013004 For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.
45013005 Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.
45013006 This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants, who give their full time to governing.
45013007 Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.
45013008 Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law.
45013009 The commandments, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You shall not covet,” and whatever other command there may be, are summed up in this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”
45013010 Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.
45013011 And do this, understanding the present time: The hour has already come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.
45013012 The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.
45013013 Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy.
45013014 Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh.
45014001 Accept the one whose faith is weak, without quarreling over disputable matters.
45014002 One person’s faith allows them to eat anything, but another, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables.
45014003 The one who eats everything must not treat with contempt the one who does not, and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does, for God has accepted them.
45014004 Who are you to judge someone else’s servant? To their own master, servants stand or fall. And they will stand, for the Lord is able to make them stand.
45014005 One person considers one day more sacred than another; another considers every day alike. Each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind.
45014006 Whoever regards one day as special does so to the Lord. Whoever eats meat does so to the Lord, for they give thanks to God; and whoever abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God.
45014007 For none of us lives for ourselves alone, and none of us dies for ourselves alone.
45014008 If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.
45014009 For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living.
45014010 You, then, why do you judge your brother or sister ? Or why do you treat them with contempt? For we will all stand before God’s judgment seat.
45014011 It is written: “ ‘As surely as I live,’ says the Lord, ‘every knee will bow before me; every tongue will acknowledge God.’ ”
45014012 So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God.
45014013 Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister.
45014014 I am convinced, being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person it is unclean.
45014015 If your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy someone for whom Christ died.
45014016 Therefore do not let what you know is good be spoken of as evil.
45014017 For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit,
45014018 because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval.
45014019 Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification.
45014020 Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a person to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.
45014021 It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother or sister to fall.
45014022 So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves.
45014023 But whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat, because their eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.
45015001 We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves.
45015002 Each of us should please our neighbors for their good, to build them up.
45015003 For even Christ did not please himself but, as it is written: “The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.”
45015004 For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through the endurance taught in the Scriptures and the encouragement they provide we might have hope.
45015005 May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had,
45015006 so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
45015007 Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God.
45015008 For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews on behalf of God’s truth, so that the promises made to the patriarchs might be confirmed
45015009 and, moreover, that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written: “Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles; I will sing the praises of your name.”
45015010 Again, it says, “Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.”
45015011 And again, “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; let all the peoples extol him.”
45015012 And again, Isaiah says, “The Root of Jesse will spring up, one who will arise to rule over the nations; in him the Gentiles will hope.”
45015013 May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
45015014 I myself am convinced, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with knowledge and competent to instruct one another.
45015015 Yet I have written you quite boldly on some points to remind you of them again, because of the grace God gave me
45015016 to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. He gave me the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
45015017 Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God.
45015018 I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done—
45015019 by the power of signs and wonders, through the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.
45015020 It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else’s foundation.
45015021 Rather, as it is written: “Those who were not told about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand.”
45015022 This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.
45015023 But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions, and since I have been longing for many years to visit you,
45015024 I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to see you while passing through and to have you assist me on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while.
45015025 Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the Lord’s people there.
45015026 For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the Lord’s people in Jerusalem.
45015027 They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews’ spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings.
45015028 So after I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received this contribution, I will go to Spain and visit you on the way.
45015029 I know that when I come to you, I will come in the full measure of the blessing of Christ.
45015030 I urge you, brothers and sisters, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me.
45015031 Pray that I may be kept safe from the unbelievers in Judea and that the contribution I take to Jerusalem may be favorably received by the Lord’s people there,
45015032 so that I may come to you with joy, by God’s will, and in your company be refreshed.
45015033 The God of peace be with you all. Amen.
45016001 I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a deacon of the church in Cenchreae.
45016002 I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of his people and to give her any help she may need from you, for she has been the benefactor of many people, including me.
45016003 Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my co-workers in Christ Jesus.
45016004 They risked their lives for me. Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them.
45016005 Greet also the church that meets at their house. Greet my dear friend Epenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia.
45016006 Greet Mary, who worked very hard for you.
45016007 Greet Andronicus and Junia, my fellow Jews who have been in prison with me. They are outstanding among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was.
45016008 Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord.
45016009 Greet Urbanus, our co-worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys.
45016010 Greet Apelles, whose fidelity to Christ has stood the test. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.
45016011 Greet Herodion, my fellow Jew. Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.
45016012 Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, those women who work hard in the Lord. Greet my dear friend Persis, another woman who has worked very hard in the Lord.
45016013 Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother, who has been a mother to me, too.
45016014 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas and the other brothers and sisters with them.
45016015 Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas and all the Lord’s people who are with them.
45016016 Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send greetings.
45016017 I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them.
45016018 For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people.
45016019 Everyone has heard about your obedience, so I rejoice because of you; but I want you to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil.
45016020 The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.
45016021 Timothy, my co-worker, sends his greetings to you, as do Lucius, Jason and Sosipater, my fellow Jews.
45016022 I, Tertius, who wrote down this letter, greet you in the Lord.
45016023 Gaius, whose hospitality I and the whole church here enjoy, sends you his greetings. Erastus, who is the city’s director of public works, and our brother Quartus send you their greetings.
45016024 
45016025 Now to him who is able to establish you in accordance with my gospel, the message I proclaim about Jesus Christ, in keeping with the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past,
45016026 but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God, so that all the Gentiles might come to the obedience that comes from faith—
45016027 to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen.
46001001 Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,
46001002 To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be his holy people, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ—their Lord and ours:
46001003 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
46001004 I always thank my God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus.
46001005 For in him you have been enriched in every way—with all kinds of speech and with all knowledge—
46001006 God thus confirming our testimony about Christ among you.
46001007 Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.
46001008 He will also keep you firm to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
46001009 God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
46001010 I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought.
46001011 My brothers and sisters, some from Chloe’s household have informed me that there are quarrels among you.
46001012 What I mean is this: One of you says, “I follow Paul”; another, “I follow Apollos”; another, “I follow Cephas ”; still another, “I follow Christ.”
46001013 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized in the name of Paul?
46001014 I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,
46001015 so no one can say that you were baptized in my name.
46001016 (Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don’t remember if I baptized anyone else.)
46001017 For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—not with wisdom and eloquence, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.
46001018 For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
46001019 For it is written: “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.”
46001020 Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
46001021 For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.
46001022 Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom,
46001023 but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,
46001024 but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
46001025 For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.
46001026 Brothers and sisters, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth.
46001027 But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.
46001028 God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things—and the things that are not—to nullify the things that are,
46001029 so that no one may boast before him.
46001030 It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption.
46001031 Therefore, as it is written: “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”
46002001 And so it was with me, brothers and sisters. When I came to you, I did not come with eloquence or human wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God.
46002002 For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
46002003 I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling.
46002004 My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit’s power,
46002005 so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God’s power.
46002006 We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.
46002007 No, we declare God’s wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began.
46002008 None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
46002009 However, as it is written: “What no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, and what no human mind has conceived” — the things God has prepared for those who love him—
46002010 these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.
46002011 For who knows a person’s thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.
46002012 What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us.
46002013 This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words.
46002014 The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit.
46002015 The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments,
46002016 for, “Who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?” But we have the mind of Christ.
46003001 Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit but as people who are still worldly—mere infants in Christ.
46003002 I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready.
46003003 You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans?
46003004 For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not mere human beings?
46003005 What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe—as the Lord has assigned to each his task.
46003006 I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow.
46003007 So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.
46003008 The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded according to their own labor.
46003009 For we are co-workers in God’s service; you are God’s field, God’s building.
46003010 By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care.
46003011 For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.
46003012 If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw,
46003013 their work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person’s work.
46003014 If what has been built survives, the builder will receive a reward.
46003015 If it is burned up, the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved—even though only as one escaping through the flames.
46003016 Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in your midst?
46003017 If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy that person; for God’s temple is sacred, and you together are that temple.
46003018 Do not deceive yourselves. If any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age, you should become “fools” so that you may become wise.
46003019 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness” ;
46003020 and again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.”
46003021 So then, no more boasting about human leaders! All things are yours,
46003022 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future—all are yours,
46003023 and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.
46004001 This, then, is how you ought to regard us: as servants of Christ and as those entrusted with the mysteries God has revealed.
46004002 Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful.
46004003 I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself.
46004004 My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.
46004005 Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of the heart. At that time each will receive their praise from God.
46004006 Now, brothers and sisters, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying, “Do not go beyond what is written.” Then you will not be puffed up in being a follower of one of us over against the other.
46004007 For who makes you different from anyone else? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?
46004008 Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! You have begun to reign—and that without us! How I wish that you really had begun to reign so that we also might reign with you!
46004009 For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, like those condemned to die in the arena. We have been made a spectacle to the whole universe, to angels as well as to human beings.
46004010 We are fools for Christ, but you are so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, we are dishonored!
46004011 To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty, we are in rags, we are brutally treated, we are homeless.
46004012 We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it;
46004013 when we are slandered, we answer kindly. We have become the scum of the earth, the garbage of the world—right up to this moment.
46004014 I am writing this not to shame you but to warn you as my dear children.
46004015 Even if you had ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.
46004016 Therefore I urge you to imitate me.
46004017 For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, my son whom I love, who is faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus, which agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church.
46004018 Some of you have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you.
46004019 But I will come to you very soon, if the Lord is willing, and then I will find out not only how these arrogant people are talking, but what power they have.
46004020 For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.
46004021 What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod of discipline, or shall I come in love and with a gentle spirit?
46005001 It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that even pagans do not tolerate: A man is sleeping with his father’s wife.
46005002 And you are proud! Shouldn’t you rather have gone into mourning and have put out of your fellowship the man who has been doing this?
46005003 For my part, even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit. As one who is present with you in this way, I have already passed judgment in the name of our Lord Jesus on the one who has been doing this.
46005004 So when you are assembled and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present,
46005005 hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord.
46005006 Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough?
46005007 Get rid of the old yeast, so that you may be a new unleavened batch—as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.
46005008 Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old bread leavened with malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
46005009 I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people—
46005010 not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world.
46005011 But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or slanderer, a drunkard or swindler. Do not even eat with such people.
46005012 What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside?
46005013 God will judge those outside. “Expel the wicked person from among you.”
46006001 If any of you has a dispute with another, do you dare to take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the Lord’s people?
46006002 Or do you not know that the Lord’s people will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases?
46006003 Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life!
46006004 Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, do you ask for a ruling from those whose way of life is scorned in the church?
46006005 I say this to shame you. Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers?
46006006 But instead, one brother takes another to court—and this in front of unbelievers!
46006007 The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?
46006008 Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers and sisters.
46006009 Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men
46006010 nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.
46006011 And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
46006012 “I have the right to do anything,” you say—but not everything is beneficial. “I have the right to do anything”—but I will not be mastered by anything.
46006013 You say, “Food for the stomach and the stomach for food, and God will destroy them both.” The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
46006014 By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us also.
46006015 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never!
46006016 Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, “The two will become one flesh.”
46006017 But whoever is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit.
46006018 Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body.
46006019 Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;
46006020 you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.
46007001 Now for the matters you wrote about: “It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.”
46007002 But since sexual immorality is occurring, each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each woman with her own husband.
46007003 The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.
46007004 The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife.
46007005 Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
46007006 I say this as a concession, not as a command.
46007007 I wish that all of you were as I am. But each of you has your own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that.
46007008 Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I do.
46007009 But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.
46007010 To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband.
46007011 But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.
46007012 To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her.
46007013 And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him.
46007014 For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.
46007015 But if the unbeliever leaves, let it be so. The brother or the sister is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace.
46007016 How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?
46007017 Nevertheless, each person should live as a believer in whatever situation the Lord has assigned to them, just as God has called them. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches.
46007018 Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised.
46007019 Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God’s commands is what counts.
46007020 Each person should remain in the situation they were in when God called them.
46007021 Were you a slave when you were called? Don’t let it trouble you—although if you can gain your freedom, do so.
46007022 For the one who was a slave when called to faith in the Lord is the Lord’s freed person; similarly, the one who was free when called is Christ’s slave.
46007023 You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of human beings.
46007024 Brothers and sisters, each person, as responsible to God, should remain in the situation they were in when God called them.
46007025 Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy.
46007026 Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for a man to remain as he is.
46007027 Are you pledged to a woman? Do not seek to be released. Are you free from such a commitment? Do not look for a wife.
46007028 But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this.
46007029 What I mean, brothers and sisters, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they do not;
46007030 those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep;
46007031 those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away.
46007032 I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord’s affairs—how he can please the Lord.
46007033 But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world—how he can please his wife—
46007034 and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord’s affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world—how she can please her husband.
46007035 I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord.
46007036 If anyone is worried that he might not be acting honorably toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if his passions are too strong and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married.
46007037 But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin—this man also does the right thing.
46007038 So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does better.
46007039 A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord.
46007040 In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is—and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.
46008001 Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that “We all possess knowledge.” But knowledge puffs up while love builds up.
46008002 Those who think they know something do not yet know as they ought to know.
46008003 But whoever loves God is known by God.
46008004 So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that “An idol is nothing at all in the world” and that “There is no God but one.”
46008005 For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords”),
46008006 yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live.
46008007 But not everyone possesses this knowledge. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat sacrificial food they think of it as having been sacrificed to a god, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled.
46008008 But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do.
46008009 Be careful, however, that the exercise of your rights does not become a stumbling block to the weak.
46008010 For if someone with a weak conscience sees you, with all your knowledge, eating in an idol’s temple, won’t that person be emboldened to eat what is sacrificed to idols?
46008011 So this weak brother or sister, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge.
46008012 When you sin against them in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.
46008013 Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother or sister to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause them to fall.
46009001 Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord?
46009002 Even though I may not be an apostle to others, surely I am to you! For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
46009003 This is my defense to those who sit in judgment on me.
46009004 Don’t we have the right to food and drink?
46009005 Don’t we have the right to take a believing wife along with us, as do the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas ?
46009006 Or is it only I and Barnabas who lack the right to not work for a living?
46009007 Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its grapes? Who tends a flock and does not drink the milk?
46009008 Do I say this merely on human authority? Doesn’t the Law say the same thing?
46009009 For it is written in the Law of Moses: “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” Is it about oxen that God is concerned?
46009010 Surely he says this for us, doesn’t he? Yes, this was written for us, because whoever plows and threshes should be able to do so in the hope of sharing in the harvest.
46009011 If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you?
46009012 If others have this right of support from you, shouldn’t we have it all the more? But we did not use this right. On the contrary, we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ.
46009013 Don’t you know that those who serve in the temple get their food from the temple, and that those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar?
46009014 In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel.
46009015 But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this in the hope that you will do such things for me, for I would rather die than allow anyone to deprive me of this boast.
46009016 For when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, since I am compelled to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!
46009017 If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if not voluntarily, I am simply discharging the trust committed to me.
46009018 What then is my reward? Just this: that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, and so not make full use of my rights as a preacher of the gospel.
46009019 Though I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible.
46009020 To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law.
46009021 To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God’s law but am under Christ’s law), so as to win those not having the law.
46009022 To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some.
46009023 I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings.
46009024 Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize.
46009025 Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever.
46009026 Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly; I do not fight like a boxer beating the air.
46009027 No, I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.
46010001 For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea.
46010002 They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.
46010003 They all ate the same spiritual food
46010004 and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.
46010005 Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them; their bodies were scattered in the wilderness.
46010006 Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did.
46010007 Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written: “The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.”
46010008 We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did—and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died.
46010009 We should not test Christ, as some of them did—and were killed by snakes.
46010010 And do not grumble, as some of them did—and were killed by the destroying angel.
46010011 These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the culmination of the ages has come.
46010012 So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don’t fall!
46010013 No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.
46010014 Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry.
46010015 I speak to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.
46010016 Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?
46010017 Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all share the one loaf.
46010018 Consider the people of Israel: Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar?
46010019 Do I mean then that food sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything?
46010020 No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to be participants with demons.
46010021 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord’s table and the table of demons.
46010022 Are we trying to arouse the Lord’s jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
46010023 “I have the right to do anything,” you say—but not everything is beneficial. “I have the right to do anything”—but not everything is constructive.
46010024 No one should seek their own good, but the good of others.
46010025 Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience,
46010026 for, “The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it.”
46010027 If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience.
46010028 But if someone says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it, both for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience.
46010029 I am referring to the other person’s conscience, not yours. For why is my freedom being judged by another’s conscience?
46010030 If I take part in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of something I thank God for?
46010031 So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.
46010032 Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God—
46010033 even as I try to please everyone in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved.
46011001 Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.
46011002 I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the traditions just as I passed them on to you.
46011003 But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.
46011004 Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.
46011005 But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head—it is the same as having her head shaved.
46011006 For if a woman does not cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head.
46011007 A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man.
46011008 For man did not come from woman, but woman from man;
46011009 neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.
46011010 It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own head, because of the angels.
46011011 Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.
46011012 For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.
46011013 Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
46011014 Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him,
46011015 but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering.
46011016 If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice—nor do the churches of God.
46011017 In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good.
46011018 In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.
46011019 No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God’s approval.
46011020 So then, when you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat,
46011021 for when you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private suppers. As a result, one person remains hungry and another gets drunk.
46011022 Don’t you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God by humiliating those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? Certainly not in this matter!
46011023 For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread,
46011024 and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.”
46011025 In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.”
46011026 For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.
46011027 So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.
46011028 Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup.
46011029 For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves.
46011030 That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.
46011031 But if we were more discerning with regard to ourselves, we would not come under such judgment.
46011032 Nevertheless, when we are judged in this way by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world.
46011033 So then, my brothers and sisters, when you gather to eat, you should all eat together.
46011034 Anyone who is hungry should eat something at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. And when I come I will give further directions.
46012001 Now about the gifts of the Spirit, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed.
46012002 You know that when you were pagans, somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to mute idols.
46012003 Therefore I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus be cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.
46012004 There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them.
46012005 There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord.
46012006 There are different kinds of working, but in all of them and in everyone it is the same God at work.
46012007 Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.
46012008 To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, to another a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit,
46012009 to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit,
46012010 to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues.
46012011 All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he distributes them to each one, just as he determines.
46012012 Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ.
46012013 For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body—whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.
46012014 Even so the body is not made up of one part but of many.
46012015 Now if the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” it would not for that reason stop being part of the body.
46012016 And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” it would not for that reason stop being part of the body.
46012017 If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?
46012018 But in fact God has placed the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be.
46012019 If they were all one part, where would the body be?
46012020 As it is, there are many parts, but one body.
46012021 The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need you!” And the head cannot say to the feet, “I don’t need you!”
46012022 On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,
46012023 and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty,
46012024 while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it,
46012025 so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other.
46012026 If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.
46012027 Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.
46012028 And God has placed in the church first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, of helping, of guidance, and of different kinds of tongues.
46012029 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?
46012030 Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues ? Do all interpret?
46012031 Now eagerly desire the greater gifts. And yet I will show you the most excellent way.
46013001 If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.
46013002 If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
46013003 If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.
46013004 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.
46013005 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.
46013006 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
46013007 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
46013008 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.
46013009 For we know in part and we prophesy in part,
46013010 but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears.
46013011 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me.
46013012 For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.
46013013 And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.
46014001 Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy.
46014002 For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God. Indeed, no one understands them; they utter mysteries by the Spirit.
46014003 But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging and comfort.
46014004 Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies edifies the church.
46014005 I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be edified.
46014006 Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?
46014007 Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the pipe or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes?
46014008 Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?
46014009 So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.
46014010 Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning.
46014011 If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker is a foreigner to me.
46014012 So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, try to excel in those that build up the church.
46014013 For this reason the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may interpret what they say.
46014014 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.
46014015 So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my understanding; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my understanding.
46014016 Otherwise when you are praising God in the Spirit, how can someone else, who is now put in the position of an inquirer, say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since they do not know what you are saying?
46014017 You are giving thanks well enough, but no one else is edified.
46014018 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.
46014019 But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.
46014020 Brothers and sisters, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults.
46014021 In the Law it is written: “With other tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.”
46014022 Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is not for unbelievers but for believers.
46014023 So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and inquirers or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind?
46014024 But if an unbeliever or an inquirer comes in while everyone is prophesying, they are convicted of sin and are brought under judgment by all,
46014025 as the secrets of their hearts are laid bare. So they will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, “God is really among you!”
46014026 What then shall we say, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each of you has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. Everything must be done so that the church may be built up.
46014027 If anyone speaks in a tongue, two—or at the most three—should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret.
46014028 If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and to God.
46014029 Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.
46014030 And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop.
46014031 For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.
46014032 The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets.
46014033 For God is not a God of disorder but of peace—as in all the congregations of the Lord’s people.
46014034 Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says.
46014035 If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.
46014036 Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?
46014037 If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit, let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord’s command.
46014038 But if anyone ignores this, they will themselves be ignored.
46014039 Therefore, my brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.
46014040 But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.
46015001 Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand.
46015002 By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.
46015003 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance : that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,
46015004 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,
46015005 and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve.
46015006 After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep.
46015007 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,
46015008 and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born.
46015009 For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
46015010 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.
46015011 Whether, then, it is I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed.
46015012 But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
46015013 If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.
46015014 And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith.
46015015 More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised.
46015016 For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either.
46015017 And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.
46015018 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.
46015019 If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.
46015020 But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
46015021 For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.
46015022 For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.
46015023 But each in turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him.
46015024 Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power.
46015025 For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
46015026 The last enemy to be destroyed is death.
46015027 For he “has put everything under his feet.” Now when it says that “everything” has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ.
46015028 When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.
46015029 Now if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them?
46015030 And as for us, why do we endanger ourselves every hour?
46015031 I face death every day—yes, just as surely as I boast about you in Christ Jesus our Lord.
46015032 If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus with no more than human hopes, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”
46015033 Do not be misled: “Bad company corrupts good character.”
46015034 Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God—I say this to your shame.
46015035 But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?”
46015036 How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
46015037 When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else.
46015038 But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body.
46015039 Not all flesh is the same: People have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another.
46015040 There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another.
46015041 The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor.
46015042 So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable;
46015043 it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;
46015044 it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.
46015045 So it is written: “The first man Adam became a living being” ; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit.
46015046 The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual.
46015047 The first man was of the dust of the earth; the second man is of heaven.
46015048 As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven.
46015049 And just as we have borne the image of the earthly man, so shall we bear the image of the heavenly man.
46015050 I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.
46015051 Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed—
46015052 in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.
46015053 For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality.
46015054 When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.”
46015055 “Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?”
46015056 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
46015057 But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
46015058 Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.
46016001 Now about the collection for the Lord’s people: Do what I told the Galatian churches to do.
46016002 On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with your income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will have to be made.
46016003 Then, when I arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem.
46016004 If it seems advisable for me to go also, they will accompany me.
46016005 After I go through Macedonia, I will come to you—for I will be going through Macedonia.
46016006 Perhaps I will stay with you for a while, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go.
46016007 For I do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.
46016008 But I will stay on at Ephesus until Pentecost,
46016009 because a great door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many who oppose me.
46016010 When Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is carrying on the work of the Lord, just as I am.
46016011 No one, then, should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he may return to me. I am expecting him along with the brothers.
46016012 Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was quite unwilling to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity.
46016013 Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong.
46016014 Do everything in love.
46016015 You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the Lord’s people. I urge you, brothers and sisters,
46016016 to submit to such people and to everyone who joins in the work and labors at it.
46016017 I was glad when Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you.
46016018 For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Such men deserve recognition.
46016019 The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house.
46016020 All the brothers and sisters here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
46016021 I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand.
46016022 If anyone does not love the Lord, let that person be cursed! Come, Lord !
46016023 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
46016024 My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
47001001 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God in Corinth, together with all his holy people throughout Achaia:
47001002 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
47001003 Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,
47001004 who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.
47001005 For just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ, so also our comfort abounds through Christ.
47001006 If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer.
47001007 And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort.
47001008 We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about the troubles we experienced in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired of life itself.
47001009 Indeed, we felt we had received the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.
47001010 He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us again. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us,
47001011 as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many.
47001012 Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, with integrity and godly sincerity. We have done so, relying not on worldly wisdom but on God’s grace.
47001013 For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that,
47001014 as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus.
47001015 Because I was confident of this, I wanted to visit you first so that you might benefit twice.
47001016 I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea.
47001017 Was I fickle when I intended to do this? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say both “Yes, yes” and “No, no”?
47001018 But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not “Yes” and “No.”
47001019 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us—by me and Silas and Timothy—was not “Yes” and “No,” but in him it has always been “Yes.”
47001020 For no matter how many promises God has made, they are “Yes” in Christ. And so through him the “Amen” is spoken by us to the glory of God.
47001021 Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us,
47001022 set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.
47001023 I call God as my witness—and I stake my life on it—that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.
47001024 Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, because it is by faith you stand firm.
47002001 So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you.
47002002 For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved?
47002003 I wrote as I did, so that when I came I would not be distressed by those who should have made me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy.
47002004 For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you.
47002005 If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you to some extent—not to put it too severely.
47002006 The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient.
47002007 Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.
47002008 I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him.
47002009 Another reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.
47002010 Anyone you forgive, I also forgive. And what I have forgiven—if there was anything to forgive—I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake,
47002011 in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.
47002012 Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me,
47002013 I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia.
47002014 But thanks be to God, who always leads us as captives in Christ’s triumphal procession and uses us to spread the aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere.
47002015 For we are to God the pleasing aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.
47002016 To the one we are an aroma that brings death; to the other, an aroma that brings life. And who is equal to such a task?
47002017 Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, as those sent from God.
47003001 Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you?
47003002 You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everyone.
47003003 You show that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.
47003004 Such confidence we have through Christ before God.
47003005 Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God.
47003006 He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant—not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
47003007 Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, transitory though it was,
47003008 will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?
47003009 If the ministry that brought condemnation was glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness!
47003010 For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory.
47003011 And if what was transitory came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!
47003012 Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold.
47003013 We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to prevent the Israelites from seeing the end of what was passing away.
47003014 But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away.
47003015 Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.
47003016 But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
47003017 Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
47003018 And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord’s glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.
47004001 Therefore, since through God’s mercy we have this ministry, we do not lose heart.
47004002 Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience in the sight of God.
47004003 And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.
47004004 The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
47004005 For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.
47004006 For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God’s glory displayed in the face of Christ.
47004007 But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.
47004008 We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;
47004009 persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.
47004010 We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.
47004011 For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that his life may also be revealed in our mortal body.
47004012 So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.
47004013 It is written: “I believed; therefore I have spoken.” Since we have that same spirit of faith, we also believe and therefore speak,
47004014 because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you to himself.
47004015 All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.
47004016 Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.
47004017 For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.
47004018 So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.
47005001 For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands.
47005002 Meanwhile we groan, longing to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling,
47005003 because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked.
47005004 For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
47005005 Now the one who has fashioned us for this very purpose is God, who has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.
47005006 Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord.
47005007 For we live by faith, not by sight.
47005008 We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.
47005009 So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it.
47005010 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.
47005011 Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade others. What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your conscience.
47005012 We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us, so that you can answer those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart.
47005013 If we are “out of our mind,” as some say, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.
47005014 For Christ’s love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died.
47005015 And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.
47005016 So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.
47005017 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!
47005018 All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation:
47005019 that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.
47005020 We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God.
47005021 God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
47006001 As God’s co-workers we urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain.
47006002 For he says, “In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.” I tell you, now is the time of God’s favor, now is the day of salvation.
47006003 We put no stumbling block in anyone’s path, so that our ministry will not be discredited.
47006004 Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships and distresses;
47006005 in beatings, imprisonments and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights and hunger;
47006006 in purity, understanding, patience and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love;
47006007 in truthful speech and in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;
47006008 through glory and dishonor, bad report and good report; genuine, yet regarded as impostors;
47006009 known, yet regarded as unknown; dying, and yet we live on; beaten, and yet not killed;
47006010 sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything.
47006011 We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, and opened wide our hearts to you.
47006012 We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us.
47006013 As a fair exchange—I speak as to my children—open wide your hearts also.
47006014 Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?
47006015 What harmony is there between Christ and Belial ? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?
47006016 What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.”
47006017 Therefore, “Come out from them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you.”
47006018 And, “I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.”
47007001 Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.
47007002 Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have exploited no one.
47007003 I do not say this to condemn you; I have said before that you have such a place in our hearts that we would live or die with you.
47007004 I have spoken to you with great frankness; I take great pride in you. I am greatly encouraged; in all our troubles my joy knows no bounds.
47007005 For when we came into Macedonia, we had no rest, but we were harassed at every turn—conflicts on the outside, fears within.
47007006 But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus,
47007007 and not only by his coming but also by the comfort you had given him. He told us about your longing for me, your deep sorrow, your ardent concern for me, so that my joy was greater than ever.
47007008 Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Though I did regret it—I see that my letter hurt you, but only for a little while—
47007009 yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us.
47007010 Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.
47007011 See what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what concern, what readiness to see justice done. At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter.
47007012 So even though I wrote to you, it was neither on account of the one who did the wrong nor on account of the injured party, but rather that before God you could see for yourselves how devoted to us you are.
47007013 By all this we are encouraged. In addition to our own encouragement, we were especially delighted to see how happy Titus was, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.
47007014 I had boasted to him about you, and you have not embarrassed me. But just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting about you to Titus has proved to be true as well.
47007015 And his affection for you is all the greater when he remembers that you were all obedient, receiving him with fear and trembling.
47007016 I am glad I can have complete confidence in you.
47008001 And now, brothers and sisters, we want you to know about the grace that God has given the Macedonian churches.
47008002 In the midst of a very severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity.
47008003 For I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own,
47008004 they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the Lord’s people.
47008005 And they exceeded our expectations: They gave themselves first of all to the Lord, and then by the will of God also to us.
47008006 So we urged Titus, just as he had earlier made a beginning, to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part.
47008007 But since you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in the love we have kindled in you —see that you also excel in this grace of giving.
47008008 I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others.
47008009 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.
47008010 And here is my judgment about what is best for you in this matter. Last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so.
47008011 Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means.
47008012 For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one does not have.
47008013 Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality.
47008014 At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. The goal is equality,
47008015 as it is written: “The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little.”
47008016 Thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you.
47008017 For Titus not only welcomed our appeal, but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm and on his own initiative.
47008018 And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel.
47008019 What is more, he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry the offering, which we administer in order to honor the Lord himself and to show our eagerness to help.
47008020 We want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift.
47008021 For we are taking pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of man.
47008022 In addition, we are sending with them our brother who has often proved to us in many ways that he is zealous, and now even more so because of his great confidence in you.
47008023 As for Titus, he is my partner and co-worker among you; as for our brothers, they are representatives of the churches and an honor to Christ.
47008024 Therefore show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you, so that the churches can see it.
47009001 There is no need for me to write to you about this service to the Lord’s people.
47009002 For I know your eagerness to help, and I have been boasting about it to the Macedonians, telling them that since last year you in Achaia were ready to give; and your enthusiasm has stirred most of them to action.
47009003 But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove hollow, but that you may be ready, as I said you would be.
47009004 For if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we—not to say anything about you—would be ashamed of having been so confident.
47009005 So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you in advance and finish the arrangements for the generous gift you had promised. Then it will be ready as a generous gift, not as one grudgingly given.
47009006 Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.
47009007 Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
47009008 And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.
47009009 As it is written: “They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor; their righteousness endures forever.”
47009010 Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness.
47009011 You will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.
47009012 This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of the Lord’s people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God.
47009013 Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, others will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else.
47009014 And in their prayers for you their hearts will go out to you, because of the surpassing grace God has given you.
47009015 Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!
47010001 By the humility and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you—I, Paul, who am “timid” when face to face with you, but “bold” toward you when away!
47010002 I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be toward some people who think that we live by the standards of this world.
47010003 For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does.
47010004 The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds.
47010005 We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.
47010006 And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience, once your obedience is complete.
47010007 You are judging by appearances. If anyone is confident that they belong to Christ, they should consider again that we belong to Christ just as much as they do.
47010008 So even if I boast somewhat freely about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up rather than tearing you down, I will not be ashamed of it.
47010009 I do not want to seem to be trying to frighten you with my letters.
47010010 For some say, “His letters are weighty and forceful, but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing.”
47010011 Such people should realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent, we will be in our actions when we are present.
47010012 We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise.
47010013 We, however, will not boast beyond proper limits, but will confine our boasting to the sphere of service God himself has assigned to us, a sphere that also includes you.
47010014 We are not going too far in our boasting, as would be the case if we had not come to you, for we did get as far as you with the gospel of Christ.
47010015 Neither do we go beyond our limits by boasting of work done by others. Our hope is that, as your faith continues to grow, our sphere of activity among you will greatly expand,
47010016 so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. For we do not want to boast about work already done in someone else’s territory.
47010017 But, “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”
47010018 For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.
47011001 I hope you will put up with me in a little foolishness. Yes, please put up with me!
47011002 I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him.
47011003 But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent’s cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.
47011004 For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the Spirit you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough.
47011005 I do not think I am in the least inferior to those “super-apostles.”
47011006 I may indeed be untrained as a speaker, but I do have knowledge. We have made this perfectly clear to you in every way.
47011007 Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge?
47011008 I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you.
47011009 And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so.
47011010 As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine.
47011011 Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!
47011012 And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about.
47011013 For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ.
47011014 And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.
47011015 It is not surprising, then, if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve.
47011016 I repeat: Let no one take me for a fool. But if you do, then tolerate me just as you would a fool, so that I may do a little boasting.
47011017 In this self-confident boasting I am not talking as the Lord would, but as a fool.
47011018 Since many are boasting in the way the world does, I too will boast.
47011019 You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise!
47011020 In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or puts on airs or slaps you in the face.
47011021 To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that! Whatever anyone else dares to boast about—I am speaking as a fool—I also dare to boast about.
47011022 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham’s descendants? So am I.
47011023 Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again.
47011024 Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.
47011025 Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was pelted with stones, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea,
47011026 I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my fellow Jews, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false believers.
47011027 I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked.
47011028 Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches.
47011029 Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn?
47011030 If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.
47011031 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever, knows that I am not lying.
47011032 In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me.
47011033 But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands.
47012001 I must go on boasting. Although there is nothing to be gained, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.
47012002 I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know—God knows.
47012003 And I know that this man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, but God knows—
47012004 was caught up to paradise and heard inexpressible things, things that no one is permitted to tell.
47012005 I will boast about a man like that, but I will not boast about myself, except about my weaknesses.
47012006 Even if I should choose to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say,
47012007 or because of these surpassingly great revelations. Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me.
47012008 Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.
47012009 But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me.
47012010 That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
47012011 I have made a fool of myself, but you drove me to it. I ought to have been commended by you, for I am not in the least inferior to the “super-apostles,” even though I am nothing.
47012012 I persevered in demonstrating among you the marks of a true apostle, including signs, wonders and miracles.
47012013 How were you inferior to the other churches, except that I was never a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!
47012014 Now I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you, because what I want is not your possessions but you. After all, children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.
47012015 So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have and expend myself as well. If I love you more, will you love me less?
47012016 Be that as it may, I have not been a burden to you. Yet, crafty fellow that I am, I caught you by trickery!
47012017 Did I exploit you through any of the men I sent to you?
47012018 I urged Titus to go to you and I sent our brother with him. Titus did not exploit you, did he? Did we not walk in the same footsteps by the same Spirit?
47012019 Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? We have been speaking in the sight of God as those in Christ; and everything we do, dear friends, is for your strengthening.
47012020 For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I want you to be, and you may not find me as you want me to be. I fear that there may be discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder.
47012021 I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you, and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual sin and debauchery in which they have indulged.
47013001 This will be my third visit to you. “Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.”
47013002 I already gave you a warning when I was with you the second time. I now repeat it while absent: On my return I will not spare those who sinned earlier or any of the others,
47013003 since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you.
47013004 For to be sure, he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God’s power. Likewise, we are weak in him, yet by God’s power we will live with him in our dealing with you.
47013005 Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you—unless, of course, you fail the test?
47013006 And I trust that you will discover that we have not failed the test.
47013007 Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong—not so that people will see that we have stood the test but so that you will do what is right even though we may seem to have failed.
47013008 For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.
47013009 We are glad whenever we are weak but you are strong; and our prayer is that you may be fully restored.
47013010 This is why I write these things when I am absent, that when I come I may not have to be harsh in my use of authority—the authority the Lord gave me for building you up, not for tearing you down.
47013011 Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice! Strive for full restoration, encourage one another, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.
47013012 Greet one another with a holy kiss.
47013013 All God’s people here send their greetings.
47013014 May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
48001001 Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor by a man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—
48001002 and all the brothers and sisters with me, To the churches in Galatia:
48001003 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
48001004 who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,
48001005 to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
48001006 I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—
48001007 which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.
48001008 But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse!
48001009 As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God’s curse!
48001010 Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ.
48001011 I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin.
48001012 I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.
48001013 For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.
48001014 I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
48001015 But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace, was pleased
48001016 to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, my immediate response was not to consult any human being.
48001017 I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went into Arabia. Later I returned to Damascus.
48001018 Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days.
48001019 I saw none of the other apostles—only James, the Lord’s brother.
48001020 I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie.
48001021 Then I went to Syria and Cilicia.
48001022 I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.
48001023 They only heard the report: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.”
48001024 And they praised God because of me.
48002001 Then after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas. I took Titus along also.
48002002 I went in response to a revelation and, meeting privately with those esteemed as leaders, I presented to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. I wanted to be sure I was not running and had not been running my race in vain.
48002003 Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek.
48002004 This matter arose because some false believers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves.
48002005 We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you.
48002006 As for those who were held in high esteem—whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not show favoritism—they added nothing to my message.
48002007 On the contrary, they recognized that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the circumcised.
48002008 For God, who was at work in Peter as an apostle to the circumcised, was also at work in me as an apostle to the Gentiles.
48002009 James, Cephas and John, those esteemed as pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me. They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised.
48002010 All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I had been eager to do all along.
48002011 When Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned.
48002012 For before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group.
48002013 The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray.
48002014 When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of them all, “You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?
48002015 “We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles
48002016 know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified.
48002017 “But if, in seeking to be justified in Christ, we Jews find ourselves also among the sinners, doesn’t that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not!
48002018 If I rebuild what I destroyed, then I really would be a lawbreaker.
48002019 “For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God.
48002020 I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
48002021 I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!”
48003001 You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.
48003002 I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by believing what you heard?
48003003 Are you so foolish? After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh?
48003004 Have you experienced so much in vain—if it really was in vain?
48003005 So again I ask, does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard?
48003006 So also Abraham “believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”
48003007 Understand, then, that those who have faith are children of Abraham.
48003008 Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you.”
48003009 So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.
48003010 For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, as it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.”
48003011 Clearly no one who relies on the law is justified before God, because “the righteous will live by faith.”
48003012 The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, it says, “The person who does these things will live by them.”
48003013 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.”
48003014 He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.
48003015 Brothers and sisters, let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in this case.
48003016 The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say “and to seeds,” meaning many people, but “and to your seed,” meaning one person, who is Christ.
48003017 What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise.
48003018 For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on the promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise.
48003019 Why, then, was the law given at all? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was given through angels and entrusted to a mediator.
48003020 A mediator, however, implies more than one party; but God is one.
48003021 Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.
48003022 But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.
48003023 Before the coming of this faith, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed.
48003024 So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith.
48003025 Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.
48003026 So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith,
48003027 for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
48003028 There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
48003029 If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.
48004001 What I am saying is that as long as an heir is underage, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate.
48004002 The heir is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father.
48004003 So also, when we were underage, we were in slavery under the elemental spiritual forces of the world.
48004004 But when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
48004005 to redeem those under the law, that we might receive adoption to sonship.
48004006 Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, “Abba, Father.”
48004007 So you are no longer a slave, but God’s child; and since you are his child, God has made you also an heir.
48004008 Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods.
48004009 But now that you know God—or rather are known by God—how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable forces ? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again?
48004010 You are observing special days and months and seasons and years!
48004011 I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you.
48004012 I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you. You did me no wrong.
48004013 As you know, it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you,
48004014 and even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself.
48004015 Where, then, is your blessing of me now? I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.
48004016 Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?
48004017 Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you from us, so that you may have zeal for them.
48004018 It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always, not just when I am with you.
48004019 My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you,
48004020 how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you!
48004021 Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says?
48004022 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.
48004023 His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a divine promise.
48004024 These things are being taken figuratively: The women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar.
48004025 Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children.
48004026 But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother.
48004027 For it is written: “Be glad, barren woman, you who never bore a child; shout for joy and cry aloud, you who were never in labor; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband.”
48004028 Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise.
48004029 At that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now.
48004030 But what does Scripture say? “Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman’s son.”
48004031 Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.
48005001 It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.
48005002 Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all.
48005003 Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law.
48005004 You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.
48005005 For through the Spirit we eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we hope.
48005006 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.
48005007 You were running a good race. Who cut in on you to keep you from obeying the truth?
48005008 That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you.
48005009 “A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough.”
48005010 I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is throwing you into confusion, whoever that may be, will have to pay the penalty.
48005011 Brothers and sisters, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished.
48005012 As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves!
48005013 You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh ; rather, serve one another humbly in love.
48005014 For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”
48005015 If you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.
48005016 So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.
48005017 For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want.
48005018 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
48005019 The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery;
48005020 idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions
48005021 and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.
48005022 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
48005023 gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.
48005024 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
48005025 Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.
48005026 Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.
48006001 Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted.
48006002 Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
48006003 If anyone thinks they are something when they are not, they deceive themselves.
48006004 Each one should test their own actions. Then they can take pride in themselves alone, without comparing themselves to someone else,
48006005 for each one should carry their own load.
48006006 Nevertheless, the one who receives instruction in the word should share all good things with their instructor.
48006007 Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.
48006008 Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.
48006009 Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.
48006010 Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.
48006011 See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand!
48006012 Those who want to impress people by means of the flesh are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.
48006013 Not even those who are circumcised keep the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your circumcision in the flesh.
48006014 May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
48006015 Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is the new creation.
48006016 Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule—to the Israel of God.
48006017 From now on, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.
48006018 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters. Amen.
49001001 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To God’s holy people in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus:
49001002 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
49001003 Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.
49001004 For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love
49001005 he predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will—
49001006 to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves.
49001007 In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace
49001008 that he lavished on us. With all wisdom and understanding,
49001009 he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ,
49001010 to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment—to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ.
49001011 In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will,
49001012 in order that we, who were the first to put our hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory.
49001013 And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit,
49001014 who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession—to the praise of his glory.
49001015 For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God’s people,
49001016 I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers.
49001017 I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better.
49001018 I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people,
49001019 and his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is the same as the mighty strength
49001020 he exerted when he raised Christ from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms,
49001021 far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name that is invoked, not only in the present age but also in the one to come.
49001022 And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church,
49001023 which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.
49002001 As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins,
49002002 in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient.
49002003 All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath.
49002004 But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy,
49002005 made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved.
49002006 And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,
49002007 in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.
49002008 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—
49002009 not by works, so that no one can boast.
49002010 For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.
49002011 Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called “uncircumcised” by those who call themselves “the circumcision” (which is done in the body by human hands)—
49002012 remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world.
49002013 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
49002014 For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility,
49002015 by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace,
49002016 and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility.
49002017 He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.
49002018 For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.
49002019 Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God’s people and also members of his household,
49002020 built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.
49002021 In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.
49002022 And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.
49003001 For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles—
49003002 Surely you have heard about the administration of God’s grace that was given to me for you,
49003003 that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly.
49003004 In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,
49003005 which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God’s holy apostles and prophets.
49003006 This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.
49003007 I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace given me through the working of his power.
49003008 Although I am less than the least of all the Lord’s people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ,
49003009 and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.
49003010 His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,
49003011 according to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.
49003012 In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence.
49003013 I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.
49003014 For this reason I kneel before the Father,
49003015 from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name.
49003016 I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being,
49003017 so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,
49003018 may have power, together with all the Lord’s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ,
49003019 and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.
49003020 Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us,
49003021 to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.
49004001 As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.
49004002 Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love.
49004003 Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.
49004004 There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called;
49004005 one Lord, one faith, one baptism;
49004006 one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
49004007 But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it.
49004008 This is why it says: “When he ascended on high, he took many captives and gave gifts to his people.”
49004009 (What does “he ascended” mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions ?
49004010 He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.)
49004011 So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers,
49004012 to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up
49004013 until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
49004014 Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming.
49004015 Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ.
49004016 From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.
49004017 So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.
49004018 They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.
49004019 Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, and they are full of greed.
49004020 That, however, is not the way of life you learned
49004021 when you heard about Christ and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.
49004022 You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;
49004023 to be made new in the attitude of your minds;
49004024 and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.
49004025 Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body.
49004026 “In your anger do not sin” : Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry,
49004027 and do not give the devil a foothold.
49004028 Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with their own hands, that they may have something to share with those in need.
49004029 Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.
49004030 And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
49004031 Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.
49004032 Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.
49005001 Follow God’s example, therefore, as dearly loved children
49005002 and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
49005003 But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God’s holy people.
49005004 Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.
49005005 For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person—such a person is an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
49005006 Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God’s wrath comes on those who are disobedient.
49005007 Therefore do not be partners with them.
49005008 For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light
49005009 (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth)
49005010 and find out what pleases the Lord.
49005011 Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.
49005012 It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.
49005013 But everything exposed by the light becomes visible—and everything that is illuminated becomes a light.
49005014 This is why it is said: “Wake up, sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”
49005015 Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise,
49005016 making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.
49005017 Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is.
49005018 Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit,
49005019 speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord,
49005020 always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
49005021 Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
49005022 Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord.
49005023 For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.
49005024 Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
49005025 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her
49005026 to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,
49005027 and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.
49005028 In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.
49005029 After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church—
49005030 for we are members of his body.
49005031 “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”
49005032 This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church.
49005033 However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
49006001 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
49006002 “Honor your father and mother”—which is the first commandment with a promise—
49006003 “so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.”
49006004 Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.
49006005 Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.
49006006 Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart.
49006007 Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not people,
49006008 because you know that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good they do, whether they are slave or free.
49006009 And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him.
49006010 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.
49006011 Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes.
49006012 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
49006013 Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.
49006014 Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place,
49006015 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.
49006016 In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
49006017 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
49006018 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people.
49006019 Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,
49006020 for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should.
49006021 Tychicus, the dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell you everything, so that you also may know how I am and what I am doing.
49006022 I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are, and that he may encourage you.
49006023 Peace to the brothers and sisters, and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
49006024 Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.
50001001 Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, To all God’s holy people in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons :
50001002 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
50001003 I thank my God every time I remember you.
50001004 In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy
50001005 because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now,
50001006 being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.
50001007 It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart and, whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God’s grace with me.
50001008 God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.
50001009 And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight,
50001010 so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,
50001011 filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ—to the glory and praise of God.
50001012 Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel.
50001013 As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ.
50001014 And because of my chains, most of the brothers and sisters have become confident in the Lord and dare all the more to proclaim the gospel without fear.
50001015 It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.
50001016 The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.
50001017 The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains.
50001018 But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,
50001019 for I know that through your prayers and God’s provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.
50001020 I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.
50001021 For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.
50001022 If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know!
50001023 I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far;
50001024 but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.
50001025 Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,
50001026 so that through my being with you again your boasting in Christ Jesus will abound on account of me.
50001027 Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in the one Spirit, striving together as one for the faith of the gospel
50001028 without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved—and that by God.
50001029 For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him,
50001030 since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.
50002001 Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion,
50002002 then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind.
50002003 Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves,
50002004 not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.
50002005 In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:
50002006 Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage;
50002007 rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.
50002008 And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death— even death on a cross!
50002009 Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name,
50002010 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
50002011 and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
50002012 Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence—continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling,
50002013 for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose.
50002014 Do everything without grumbling or arguing,
50002015 so that you may become blameless and pure, “children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.” Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky
50002016 as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain.
50002017 But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you.
50002018 So you too should be glad and rejoice with me.
50002019 I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I receive news about you.
50002020 I have no one else like him, who will show genuine concern for your welfare.
50002021 For everyone looks out for their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.
50002022 But you know that Timothy has proved himself, because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel.
50002023 I hope, therefore, to send him as soon as I see how things go with me.
50002024 And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon.
50002025 But I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, co-worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger, whom you sent to take care of my needs.
50002026 For he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill.
50002027 Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow.
50002028 Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety.
50002029 So then, welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him,
50002030 because he almost died for the work of Christ. He risked his life to make up for the help you yourselves could not give me.
50003001 Further, my brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you.
50003002 Watch out for those dogs, those evildoers, those mutilators of the flesh.
50003003 For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh—
50003004 though I myself have reasons for such confidence. If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more:
50003005 circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee;
50003006 as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for righteousness based on the law, faultless.
50003007 But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.
50003008 What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ
50003009 and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith.
50003010 I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,
50003011 and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead.
50003012 Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.
50003013 Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,
50003014 I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.
50003015 All of us, then, who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you.
50003016 Only let us live up to what we have already attained.
50003017 Join together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and just as you have us as a model, keep your eyes on those who live as we do.
50003018 For, as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.
50003019 Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things.
50003020 But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,
50003021 who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.
50004001 Therefore, my brothers and sisters, you whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends!
50004002 I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord.
50004003 Yes, and I ask you, my true companion, help these women since they have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my co-workers, whose names are in the book of life.
50004004 Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!
50004005 Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near.
50004006 Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.
50004007 And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
50004008 Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.
50004009 Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.
50004010 I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it.
50004011 I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.
50004012 I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.
50004013 I can do all this through him who gives me strength.
50004014 Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles.
50004015 Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only;
50004016 for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once when I was in need.
50004017 Not that I desire your gifts; what I desire is that more be credited to your account.
50004018 I have received full payment and have more than enough. I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.
50004019 And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.
50004020 To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
50004021 Greet all God’s people in Christ Jesus. The brothers and sisters who are with me send greetings.
50004022 All God’s people here send you greetings, especially those who belong to Caesar’s household.
50004023 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
51001001 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
51001002 To God’s holy people in Colossae, the faithful brothers and sisters in Christ: Grace and peace to you from God our Father.
51001003 We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,
51001004 because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all God’s people—
51001005 the faith and love that spring from the hope stored up for you in heaven and about which you have already heard in the true message of the gospel
51001006 that has come to you. In the same way, the gospel is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world—just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood God’s grace.
51001007 You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,
51001008 and who also told us of your love in the Spirit.
51001009 For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you. We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives,
51001010 so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God,
51001011 being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience,
51001012 and giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light.
51001013 For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves,
51001014 in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
51001015 The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.
51001016 For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him.
51001017 He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.
51001018 And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy.
51001019 For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him,
51001020 and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.
51001021 Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior.
51001022 But now he has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation—
51001023 if you continue in your faith, established and firm, and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.
51001024 Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church.
51001025 I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness—
51001026 the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the Lord’s people.
51001027 To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
51001028 He is the one we proclaim, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ.
51001029 To this end I strenuously contend with all the energy Christ so powerfully works in me.
51002001 I want you to know how hard I am contending for you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not met me personally.
51002002 My goal is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ,
51002003 in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
51002004 I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine-sounding arguments.
51002005 For though I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit and delight to see how disciplined you are and how firm your faith in Christ is.
51002006 So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him,
51002007 rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.
51002008 See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of this world rather than on Christ.
51002009 For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form,
51002010 and in Christ you have been brought to fullness. He is the head over every power and authority.
51002011 In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human hands. Your whole self ruled by the flesh was put off when you were circumcised by Christ,
51002012 having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.
51002013 When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins,
51002014 having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross.
51002015 And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.
51002016 Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day.
51002017 These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ.
51002018 Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you. Such a person also goes into great detail about what they have seen; they are puffed up with idle notions by their unspiritual mind.
51002019 They have lost connection with the head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow.
51002020 Since you died with Christ to the elemental spiritual forces of this world, why, as though you still belonged to the world, do you submit to its rules:
51002021 “Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!”?
51002022 These rules, which have to do with things that are all destined to perish with use, are based on merely human commands and teachings.
51002023 Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.
51003001 Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
51003002 Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.
51003003 For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.
51003004 When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.
51003005 Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry.
51003006 Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.
51003007 You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived.
51003008 But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips.
51003009 Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices
51003010 and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.
51003011 Here there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all.
51003012 Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.
51003013 Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
51003014 And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.
51003015 Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful.
51003016 Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.
51003017 And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
51003018 Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
51003019 Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.
51003020 Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.
51003021 Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will become discouraged.
51003022 Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord.
51003023 Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters,
51003024 since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.
51003025 Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for their wrongs, and there is no favoritism.
51004001 Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because you know that you also have a Master in heaven.
51004002 Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful.
51004003 And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains.
51004004 Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should.
51004005 Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity.
51004006 Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.
51004007 Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a dear brother, a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord.
51004008 I am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts.
51004009 He is coming with Onesimus, our faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here.
51004010 My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. (You have received instructions about him; if he comes to you, welcome him.)
51004011 Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings. These are the only Jews among my co-workers for the kingdom of God, and they have proved a comfort to me.
51004012 Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, that you may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured.
51004013 I vouch for him that he is working hard for you and for those at Laodicea and Hierapolis.
51004014 Our dear friend Luke, the doctor, and Demas send greetings.
51004015 Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house.
51004016 After this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea.
51004017 Tell Archippus: “See to it that you complete the ministry you have received in the Lord.”
51004018 I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.
52001001 Paul, Silas and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace and peace to you.
52001002 We always thank God for all of you and continually mention you in our prayers.
52001003 We remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
52001004 For we know, brothers and sisters loved by God, that he has chosen you,
52001005 because our gospel came to you not simply with words but also with power, with the Holy Spirit and deep conviction. You know how we lived among you for your sake.
52001006 You became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you welcomed the message in the midst of severe suffering with the joy given by the Holy Spirit.
52001007 And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.
52001008 The Lord’s message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia—your faith in God has become known everywhere. Therefore we do not need to say anything about it,
52001009 for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us. They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,
52001010 and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead—Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath.
52002001 You know, brothers and sisters, that our visit to you was not without results.
52002002 We had previously suffered and been treated outrageously in Philippi, as you know, but with the help of our God we dared to tell you his gospel in the face of strong opposition.
52002003 For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are we trying to trick you.
52002004 On the contrary, we speak as those approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel. We are not trying to please people but God, who tests our hearts.
52002005 You know we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed—God is our witness.
52002006 We were not looking for praise from people, not from you or anyone else, even though as apostles of Christ we could have asserted our authority.
52002007 Instead, we were like young children among you. Just as a nursing mother cares for her children,
52002008 so we cared for you. Because we loved you so much, we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well.
52002009 Surely you remember, brothers and sisters, our toil and hardship; we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of God to you.
52002010 You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous and blameless we were among you who believed.
52002011 For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children,
52002012 encouraging, comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God, who calls you into his kingdom and glory.
52002013 And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human word, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is indeed at work in you who believe.
52002014 For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of God’s churches in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus: You suffered from your own people the same things those churches suffered from the Jews
52002015 who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to everyone
52002016 in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of God has come upon them at last.
52002017 But, brothers and sisters, when we were orphaned by being separated from you for a short time (in person, not in thought), out of our intense longing we made every effort to see you.
52002018 For we wanted to come to you—certainly I, Paul, did, again and again—but Satan blocked our way.
52002019 For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you?
52002020 Indeed, you are our glory and joy.
52003001 So when we could stand it no longer, we thought it best to be left by ourselves in Athens.
52003002 We sent Timothy, who is our brother and co-worker in God’s service in spreading the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith,
52003003 so that no one would be unsettled by these trials. For you know quite well that we are destined for them.
52003004 In fact, when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted. And it turned out that way, as you well know.
52003005 For this reason, when I could stand it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith. I was afraid that in some way the tempter had tempted you and that our labors might have been in vain.
52003006 But Timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love. He has told us that you always have pleasant memories of us and that you long to see us, just as we also long to see you.
52003007 Therefore, brothers and sisters, in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith.
52003008 For now we really live, since you are standing firm in the Lord.
52003009 How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our God because of you?
52003010 Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith.
52003011 Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to come to you.
52003012 May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else, just as ours does for you.
52003013 May he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones.
52004001 As for other matters, brothers and sisters, we instructed you how to live in order to please God, as in fact you are living. Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more.
52004002 For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.
52004003 It is God’s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality;
52004004 that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable,
52004005 not in passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God;
52004006 and that in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister. The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins, as we told you and warned you before.
52004007 For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life.
52004008 Therefore, anyone who rejects this instruction does not reject a human being but God, the very God who gives you his Holy Spirit.
52004009 Now about your love for one another we do not need to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love each other.
52004010 And in fact, you do love all of God’s family throughout Macedonia. Yet we urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more,
52004011 and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands, just as we told you,
52004012 so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.
52004013 Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope.
52004014 For we believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.
52004015 According to the Lord’s word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep.
52004016 For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
52004017 After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.
52004018 Therefore encourage one another with these words.
52005001 Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you,
52005002 for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
52005003 While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.
52005004 But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief.
52005005 You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.
52005006 So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober.
52005007 For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.
52005008 But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.
52005009 For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.
52005010 He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.
52005011 Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.
52005012 Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among you, who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you.
52005013 Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other.
52005014 And we urge you, brothers and sisters, warn those who are idle and disruptive, encourage the disheartened, help the weak, be patient with everyone.
52005015 Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else.
52005016 Rejoice always,
52005017 pray continually,
52005018 give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.
52005019 Do not quench the Spirit.
52005020 Do not treat prophecies with contempt
52005021 but test them all; hold on to what is good,
52005022 reject every kind of evil.
52005023 May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
52005024 The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it.
52005025 Brothers and sisters, pray for us.
52005026 Greet all God’s people with a holy kiss.
52005027 I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters.
52005028 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
53001001 Paul, Silas and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
53001002 Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
53001003 We ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters, and rightly so, because your faith is growing more and more, and the love all of you have for one another is increasing.
53001004 Therefore, among God’s churches we boast about your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and trials you are enduring.
53001005 All this is evidence that God’s judgment is right, and as a result you will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are suffering.
53001006 God is just: He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you
53001007 and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels.
53001008 He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
53001009 They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might
53001010 on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at among all those who have believed. This includes you, because you believed our testimony to you.
53001011 With this in mind, we constantly pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his calling, and that by his power he may bring to fruition your every desire for goodness and your every deed prompted by faith.
53001012 We pray this so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
53002001 Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers and sisters,
53002002 not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by the teaching allegedly from us—whether by a prophecy or by word of mouth or by letter—asserting that the day of the Lord has already come.
53002003 Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction.
53002004 He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple, proclaiming himself to be God.
53002005 Don’t you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things?
53002006 And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time.
53002007 For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way.
53002008 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming.
53002009 The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie,
53002010 and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.
53002011 For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie
53002012 and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.
53002013 But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters loved by the Lord, because God chose you as firstfruits to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth.
53002014 He called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
53002015 So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold fast to the teachings we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter.
53002016 May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope,
53002017 encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word.
53003001 As for other matters, brothers and sisters, pray for us that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you.
53003002 And pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil people, for not everyone has faith.
53003003 But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen you and protect you from the evil one.
53003004 We have confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do the things we command.
53003005 May the Lord direct your hearts into God’s love and Christ’s perseverance.
53003006 In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers and sisters, to keep away from every believer who is idle and disruptive and does not live according to the teaching you received from us.
53003007 For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you,
53003008 nor did we eat anyone’s food without paying for it. On the contrary, we worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you.
53003009 We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate.
53003010 For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: “The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.”
53003011 We hear that some among you are idle and disruptive. They are not busy; they are busybodies.
53003012 Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and earn the food they eat.
53003013 And as for you, brothers and sisters, never tire of doing what is good.
53003014 Take special note of anyone who does not obey our instruction in this letter. Do not associate with them, in order that they may feel ashamed.
53003015 Yet do not regard them as an enemy, but warn them as you would a fellow believer.
53003016 Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you.
53003017 I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand, which is the distinguishing mark in all my letters. This is how I write.
53003018 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
54001001 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,
54001002 To Timothy my true son in the faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
54001003 As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain people not to teach false doctrines any longer
54001004 or to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. Such things promote controversial speculations rather than advancing God’s work—which is by faith.
54001005 The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.
54001006 Some have departed from these and have turned to meaningless talk.
54001007 They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm.
54001008 We know that the law is good if one uses it properly.
54001009 We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers,
54001010 for the sexually immoral, for those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers—and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine
54001011 that conforms to the gospel concerning the glory of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.
54001012 I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that he considered me trustworthy, appointing me to his service.
54001013 Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief.
54001014 The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
54001015 Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst.
54001016 But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life.
54001017 Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
54001018 Timothy, my son, I am giving you this command in keeping with the prophecies once made about you, so that by recalling them you may fight the battle well,
54001019 holding on to faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and so have suffered shipwreck with regard to the faith.
54001020 Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme.
54002001 I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people—
54002002 for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.
54002003 This is good, and pleases God our Savior,
54002004 who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.
54002005 For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus,
54002006 who gave himself as a ransom for all people. This has now been witnessed to at the proper time.
54002007 And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle—I am telling the truth, I am not lying—and a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles.
54002008 Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing.
54002009 I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,
54002010 but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.
54002011 A woman should learn in quietness and full submission.
54002012 I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet.
54002013 For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
54002014 And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.
54002015 But women will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety.
54003001 Here is a trustworthy saying: Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task.
54003002 Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,
54003003 not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.
54003004 He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he must do so in a manner worthy of full respect.
54003005 (If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God’s church?)
54003006 He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil.
54003007 He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil’s trap.
54003008 In the same way, deacons are to be worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain.
54003009 They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience.
54003010 They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons.
54003011 In the same way, the women are to be worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything.
54003012 A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well.
54003013 Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.
54003014 Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that,
54003015 if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God’s household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.
54003016 Beyond all question, the mystery from which true godliness springs is great: He appeared in the flesh, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.
54004001 The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.
54004002 Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron.
54004003 They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth.
54004004 For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,
54004005 because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.
54004006 If you point these things out to the brothers and sisters, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished on the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed.
54004007 Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives’ tales; rather, train yourself to be godly.
54004008 For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.
54004009 This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance.
54004010 That is why we labor and strive, because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, and especially of those who believe.
54004011 Command and teach these things.
54004012 Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity.
54004013 Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching.
54004014 Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you.
54004015 Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress.
54004016 Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.
54005001 Do not rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers,
54005002 older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity.
54005003 Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need.
54005004 But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God.
54005005 The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help.
54005006 But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives.
54005007 Give the people these instructions, so that no one may be open to blame.
54005008 Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
54005009 No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been faithful to her husband,
54005010 and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the Lord’s people, helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds.
54005011 As for younger widows, do not put them on such a list. For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry.
54005012 Thus they bring judgment on themselves, because they have broken their first pledge.
54005013 Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also busybodies who talk nonsense, saying things they ought not to.
54005014 So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
54005015 Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan.
54005016 If any woman who is a believer has widows in her care, she should continue to help them and not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows who are really in need.
54005017 The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching.
54005018 For Scripture says, “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,” and “The worker deserves his wages.”
54005019 Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses.
54005020 But those elders who are sinning you are to reprove before everyone, so that the others may take warning.
54005021 I charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism.
54005022 Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, and do not share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.
54005023 Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses.
54005024 The sins of some are obvious, reaching the place of judgment ahead of them; the sins of others trail behind them.
54005025 In the same way, good deeds are obvious, and even those that are not obvious cannot remain hidden forever.
54006001 All who are under the yoke of slavery should consider their masters worthy of full respect, so that God’s name and our teaching may not be slandered.
54006002 Those who have believing masters should not show them disrespect just because they are fellow believers. Instead, they should serve them even better because their masters are dear to them as fellow believers and are devoted to the welfare of their slaves. These are the things you are to teach and insist on.
54006003 If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree to the sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching,
54006004 they are conceited and understand nothing. They have an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy, strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions
54006005 and constant friction between people of corrupt mind, who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain.
54006006 But godliness with contentment is great gain.
54006007 For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it.
54006008 But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that.
54006009 Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.
54006010 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.
54006011 But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness.
54006012 Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses.
54006013 In the sight of God, who gives life to everything, and of Christ Jesus, who while testifying before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I charge you
54006014 to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
54006015 which God will bring about in his own time—God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords,
54006016 who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see. To him be honor and might forever. Amen.
54006017 Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.
54006018 Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share.
54006019 In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life.
54006020 Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to your care. Turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge,
54006021 which some have professed and in so doing have departed from the faith. Grace be with you all.
55001001 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, in keeping with the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,
55001002 To Timothy, my dear son: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
55001003 I thank God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.
55001004 Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy.
55001005 I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.
55001006 For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
55001007 For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline.
55001008 So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner. Rather, join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God.
55001009 He has saved us and called us to a holy life—not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,
55001010 but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.
55001011 And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher.
55001012 That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet this is no cause for shame, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day.
55001013 What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.
55001014 Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you—guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.
55001015 You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
55001016 May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.
55001017 On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me.
55001018 May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.
55002001 You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
55002002 And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others.
55002003 Join with me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
55002004 No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs, but rather tries to please his commanding officer.
55002005 Similarly, anyone who competes as an athlete does not receive the victor’s crown except by competing according to the rules.
55002006 The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops.
55002007 Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this.
55002008 Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel,
55002009 for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God’s word is not chained.
55002010 Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
55002011 Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him;
55002012 if we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also disown us;
55002013 if we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he cannot disown himself.
55002014 Keep reminding God’s people of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen.
55002015 Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.
55002016 Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly.
55002017 Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,
55002018 who have departed from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some.
55002019 Nevertheless, God’s solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.”
55002020 In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for special purposes and some for common use.
55002021 Those who cleanse themselves from the latter will be instruments for special purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work.
55002022 Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
55002023 Don’t have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels.
55002024 And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.
55002025 Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth,
55002026 and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.
55003001 But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days.
55003002 People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,
55003003 without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good,
55003004 treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God—
55003005 having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people.
55003006 They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over gullible women, who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires,
55003007 always learning but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth.
55003008 Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these teachers oppose the truth. They are men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is concerned, are rejected.
55003009 But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those men, their folly will be clear to everyone.
55003010 You, however, know all about my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance,
55003011 persecutions, sufferings—what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch, Iconium and Lystra, the persecutions I endured. Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.
55003012 In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,
55003013 while evildoers and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
55003014 But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it,
55003015 and how from infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
55003016 All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,
55003017 so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.
55004001 In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge:
55004002 Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction.
55004003 For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.
55004004 They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.
55004005 But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry.
55004006 For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my departure is near.
55004007 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.
55004008 Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.
55004009 Do your best to come to me quickly,
55004010 for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.
55004011 Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry.
55004012 I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
55004013 When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments.
55004014 Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him for what he has done.
55004015 You too should be on your guard against him, because he strongly opposed our message.
55004016 At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them.
55004017 But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion’s mouth.
55004018 The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
55004019 Greet Priscilla and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus.
55004020 Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus.
55004021 Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia and all the brothers and sisters.
55004022 The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you all.
56001001 Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ to further the faith of God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness—
56001002 in the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before the beginning of time,
56001003 and which now at his appointed season he has brought to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior,
56001004 To Titus, my true son in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
56001005 The reason I left you in Crete was that you might put in order what was left unfinished and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you.
56001006 An elder must be blameless, faithful to his wife, a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient.
56001007 Since an overseer manages God’s household, he must be blameless—not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain.
56001008 Rather, he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined.
56001009 He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.
56001010 For there are many rebellious people, full of meaningless talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision group.
56001011 They must be silenced, because they are disrupting whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach—and that for the sake of dishonest gain.
56001012 One of Crete’s own prophets has said it: “Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons.”
56001013 This saying is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith
56001014 and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the merely human commands of those who reject the truth.
56001015 To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted.
56001016 They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good.
56002001 You, however, must teach what is appropriate to sound doctrine.
56002002 Teach the older men to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.
56002003 Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good.
56002004 Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children,
56002005 to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God.
56002006 Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled.
56002007 In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness
56002008 and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.
56002009 Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them,
56002010 and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive.
56002011 For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people.
56002012 It teaches us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age,
56002013 while we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,
56002014 who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.
56002015 These, then, are the things you should teach. Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you.
56003001 Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to do whatever is good,
56003002 to slander no one, to be peaceable and considerate, and always to be gentle toward everyone.
56003003 At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another.
56003004 But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared,
56003005 he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit,
56003006 whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior,
56003007 so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.
56003008 This is a trustworthy saying. And I want you to stress these things, so that those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good. These things are excellent and profitable for everyone.
56003009 But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels about the law, because these are unprofitable and useless.
56003010 Warn a divisive person once, and then warn them a second time. After that, have nothing to do with them.
56003011 You may be sure that such people are warped and sinful; they are self-condemned.
56003012 As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, because I have decided to winter there.
56003013 Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way and see that they have everything they need.
56003014 Our people must learn to devote themselves to doing what is good, in order to provide for urgent needs and not live unproductive lives.
56003015 Everyone with me sends you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.
57001001 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker—
57001002 also to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier—and to the church that meets in your home:
57001003 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
57001004 I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,
57001005 because I hear about your love for all his holy people and your faith in the Lord Jesus.
57001006 I pray that your partnership with us in the faith may be effective in deepening your understanding of every good thing we share for the sake of Christ.
57001007 Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the Lord’s people.
57001008 Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,
57001009 yet I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love. It is as none other than Paul—an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus—
57001010 that I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, who became my son while I was in chains.
57001011 Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.
57001012 I am sending him—who is my very heart—back to you.
57001013 I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.
57001014 But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do would not seem forced but would be voluntary.
57001015 Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever—
57001016 no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a fellow man and as a brother in the Lord.
57001017 So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.
57001018 If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.
57001019 I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back—not to mention that you owe me your very self.
57001020 I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.
57001021 Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.
57001022 And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.
57001023 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.
57001024 And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.
57001025 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
58001001 In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways,
58001002 but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe.
58001003 The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.
58001004 So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs.
58001005 For to which of the angels did God ever say, “You are my Son; today I have become your Father” ? Or again, “I will be his Father, and he will be my Son” ?
58001006 And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says, “Let all God’s angels worship him.”
58001007 In speaking of the angels he says, “He makes his angels spirits, and his servants flames of fire.”
58001008 But about the Son he says, “Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom.
58001009 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.”
58001010 He also says, “In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.
58001011 They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment.
58001012 You will roll them up like a robe; like a garment they will be changed. But you remain the same, and your years will never end.”
58001013 To which of the angels did God ever say, “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet” ?
58001014 Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?
58002001 We must pay the most careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.
58002002 For since the message spoken through angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment,
58002003 how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him.
58002004 God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.
58002005 It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.
58002006 But there is a place where someone has testified: “What is mankind that you are mindful of them, a son of man that you care for him?
58002007 You made them a little lower than the angels; you crowned them with glory and honor
58002008 and put everything under their feet.” In putting everything under them, God left nothing that is not subject to them. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to them.
58002009 But we do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.
58002010 In bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through what he suffered.
58002011 Both the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters.
58002012 He says, “I will declare your name to my brothers and sisters; in the assembly I will sing your praises.”
58002013 And again, “I will put my trust in him.” And again he says, “Here am I, and the children God has given me.”
58002014 Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil—
58002015 and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.
58002016 For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham’s descendants.
58002017 For this reason he had to be made like them, fully human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people.
58002018 Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.
58003001 Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, whom we acknowledge as our apostle and high priest.
58003002 He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God’s house.
58003003 Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.
58003004 For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.
58003005 “Moses was faithful as a servant in all God’s house,” bearing witness to what would be spoken by God in the future.
58003006 But Christ is faithful as the Son over God’s house. And we are his house, if indeed we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we glory.
58003007 So, as the Holy Spirit says: “Today, if you hear his voice,
58003008 do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion, during the time of testing in the wilderness,
58003009 where your ancestors tested and tried me, though for forty years they saw what I did.
58003010 That is why I was angry with that generation; I said, ‘Their hearts are always going astray, and they have not known my ways.’
58003011 So I declared on oath in my anger, ‘They shall never enter my rest.’ ”
58003012 See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.
58003013 But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you may be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness.
58003014 We have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original conviction firmly to the very end.
58003015 As has just been said: “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion.”
58003016 Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt?
58003017 And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies perished in the wilderness?
58003018 And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed?
58003019 So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief.
58004001 Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.
58004002 For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed.
58004003 Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, “So I declared on oath in my anger, ‘They shall never enter my rest.’ ” And yet his works have been finished since the creation of the world.
58004004 For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: “On the seventh day God rested from all his works.”
58004005 And again in the passage above he says, “They shall never enter my rest.”
58004006 Therefore since it still remains for some to enter that rest, and since those who formerly had the good news proclaimed to them did not go in because of their disobedience,
58004007 God again set a certain day, calling it “Today.” This he did when a long time later he spoke through David, as in the passage already quoted: “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.”
58004008 For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.
58004009 There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God;
58004010 for anyone who enters God’s rest also rests from their works, just as God did from his.
58004011 Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will perish by following their example of disobedience.
58004012 For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.
58004013 Nothing in all creation is hidden from God’s sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.
58004014 Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.
58004015 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin.
58004016 Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
58005001 Every high priest is selected from among the people and is appointed to represent the people in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.
58005002 He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness.
58005003 This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people.
58005004 And no one takes this honor on himself, but he receives it when called by God, just as Aaron was.
58005005 In the same way, Christ did not take on himself the glory of becoming a high priest. But God said to him, “You are my Son; today I have become your Father.”
58005006 And he says in another place, “You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.”
58005007 During the days of Jesus’ life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with fervent cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission.
58005008 Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered
58005009 and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him
58005010 and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of Melchizedek.
58005011 We have much to say about this, but it is hard to make it clear to you because you no longer try to understand.
58005012 In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God’s word all over again. You need milk, not solid food!
58005013 Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness.
58005014 But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.
58006001 Therefore let us move beyond the elementary teachings about Christ and be taken forward to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death, and of faith in God,
58006002 instruction about cleansing rites, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.
58006003 And God permitting, we will do so.
58006004 It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit,
58006005 who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age
58006006 and who have fallen away, to be brought back to repentance. To their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace.
58006007 Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God.
58006008 But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed. In the end it will be burned.
58006009 Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are convinced of better things in your case—the things that have to do with salvation.
58006010 God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them.
58006011 We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, so that what you hope for may be fully realized.
58006012 We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.
58006013 When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself,
58006014 saying, “I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.”
58006015 And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised.
58006016 People swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument.
58006017 Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath.
58006018 God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be greatly encouraged.
58006019 We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,
58006020 where our forerunner, Jesus, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.
58007001 This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him,
58007002 and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, the name Melchizedek means “king of righteousness”; then also, “king of Salem” means “king of peace.”
58007003 Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest forever.
58007004 Just think how great he was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder!
58007005 Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people—that is, from their fellow Israelites—even though they also are descended from Abraham.
58007006 This man, however, did not trace his descent from Levi, yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.
58007007 And without doubt the lesser is blessed by the greater.
58007008 In the one case, the tenth is collected by people who die; but in the other case, by him who is declared to be living.
58007009 One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham,
58007010 because when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor.
58007011 If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood—and indeed the law given to the people established that priesthood—why was there still need for another priest to come, one in the order of Melchizedek, not in the order of Aaron?
58007012 For when the priesthood is changed, the law must be changed also.
58007013 He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar.
58007014 For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.
58007015 And what we have said is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears,
58007016 one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life.
58007017 For it is declared: “You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.”
58007018 The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless
58007019 (for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God.
58007020 And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath,
58007021 but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him: “The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: ‘You are a priest forever.’ ”
58007022 Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant.
58007023 Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office;
58007024 but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.
58007025 Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.
58007026 Such a high priest truly meets our need—one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens.
58007027 Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself.
58007028 For the law appoints as high priests men in all their weakness; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.
58008001 Now the main point of what we are saying is this: We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,
58008002 and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by a mere human being.
58008003 Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, and so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer.
58008004 If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, for there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law.
58008005 They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.”
58008006 But in fact the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one, since the new covenant is established on better promises.
58008007 For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another.
58008008 But God found fault with the people and said : “The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah.
58008009 It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they did not remain faithful to my covenant, and I turned away from them, declares the Lord.
58008010 This is the covenant I will establish with the people of Israel after that time, declares the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.
58008011 No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, ‘Know the Lord,’ because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest.
58008012 For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.”
58008013 By calling this covenant “new,” he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear.
58009001 Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary.
58009002 A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand and the table with its consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place.
58009003 Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place,
58009004 which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron’s staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant.
58009005 Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now.
58009006 When everything had been arranged like this, the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry.
58009007 But only the high priest entered the inner room, and that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance.
58009008 The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still functioning.
58009009 This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper.
58009010 They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings—external regulations applying until the time of the new order.
58009011 But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made with human hands, that is to say, is not a part of this creation.
58009012 He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption.
58009013 The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean.
58009014 How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God!
58009015 For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance—now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.
58009016 In the case of a will, it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it,
58009017 because a will is in force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect while the one who made it is living.
58009018 This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood.
58009019 When Moses had proclaimed every command of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves, together with water, scarlet wool and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people.
58009020 He said, “This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep.”
58009021 In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies.
58009022 In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
58009023 It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
58009024 For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with human hands that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God’s presence.
58009025 Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own.
58009026 Otherwise Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But he has appeared once for all at the culmination of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.
58009027 Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment,
58009028 so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.
58010001 The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming—not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship.
58010002 Otherwise, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins.
58010003 But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins.
58010004 It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
58010005 Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: “Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me;
58010006 with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased.
58010007 Then I said, ‘Here I am—it is written about me in the scroll— I have come to do your will, my God.’ ”
58010008 First he said, “Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them”—though they were offered in accordance with the law.
58010009 Then he said, “Here I am, I have come to do your will.” He sets aside the first to establish the second.
58010010 And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
58010011 Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.
58010012 But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God,
58010013 and since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool.
58010014 For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.
58010015 The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says:
58010016 “This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds.”
58010017 Then he adds: “Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.”
58010018 And where these have been forgiven, sacrifice for sin is no longer necessary.
58010019 Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus,
58010020 by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body,
58010021 and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
58010022 let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.
58010023 Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.
58010024 And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds,
58010025 not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.
58010026 If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left,
58010027 but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.
58010028 Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
58010029 How much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified them, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?
58010030 For we know him who said, “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” and again, “The Lord will judge his people.”
58010031 It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
58010032 Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, when you endured in a great conflict full of suffering.
58010033 Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution; at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated.
58010034 You suffered along with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions.
58010035 So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded.
58010036 You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised.
58010037 For, “In just a little while, he who is coming will come and will not delay.”
58010038 And, “But my righteous one will live by faith. And I take no pleasure in the one who shrinks back.”
58010039 But we do not belong to those who shrink back and are destroyed, but to those who have faith and are saved.
58011001 Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.
58011002 This is what the ancients were commended for.
58011003 By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.
58011004 By faith Abel brought God a better offering than Cain did. By faith he was commended as righteous, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith Abel still speaks, even though he is dead.
58011005 By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death: “He could not be found, because God had taken him away.” For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God.
58011006 And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.
58011007 By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that is in keeping with faith.
58011008 By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.
58011009 By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise.
58011010 For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
58011011 And by faith even Sarah, who was past childbearing age, was enabled to bear children because she considered him faithful who had made the promise.
58011012 And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.
58011013 All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth.
58011014 People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own.
58011015 If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return.
58011016 Instead, they were longing for a better country—a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.
58011017 By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had embraced the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son,
58011018 even though God had said to him, “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.”
58011019 Abraham reasoned that God could even raise the dead, and so in a manner of speaking he did receive Isaac back from death.
58011020 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.
58011021 By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph’s sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff.
58011022 By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions concerning the burial of his bones.
58011023 By faith Moses’ parents hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king’s edict.
58011024 By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh’s daughter.
58011025 He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.
58011026 He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward.
58011027 By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king’s anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible.
58011028 By faith he kept the Passover and the application of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel.
58011029 By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned.
58011030 By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the army had marched around them for seven days.
58011031 By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient.
58011032 And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson and Jephthah, about David and Samuel and the prophets,
58011033 who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions,
58011034 quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies.
58011035 Women received back their dead, raised to life again. There were others who were tortured, refusing to be released so that they might gain an even better resurrection.
58011036 Some faced jeers and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment.
58011037 They were put to death by stoning; they were sawed in two; they were killed by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated—
58011038 the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, living in caves and in holes in the ground.
58011039 These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised,
58011040 since God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.
58012001 Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us,
58012002 fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
58012003 Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
58012004 In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.
58012005 And have you completely forgotten this word of encouragement that addresses you as a father addresses his son? It says, “My son, do not make light of the Lord’s discipline, and do not lose heart when he rebukes you,
58012006 because the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and he chastens everyone he accepts as his son.”
58012007 Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as his children. For what children are not disciplined by their father?
58012008 If you are not disciplined—and everyone undergoes discipline—then you are not legitimate, not true sons and daughters at all.
58012009 Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live!
58012010 They disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share in his holiness.
58012011 No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.
58012012 Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees.
58012013 “Make level paths for your feet,” so that the lame may not be disabled, but rather healed.
58012014 Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord.
58012015 See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many.
58012016 See that no one is sexually immoral, or is godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son.
58012017 Afterward, as you know, when he wanted to inherit this blessing, he was rejected. Even though he sought the blessing with tears, he could not change what he had done.
58012018 You have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire; to darkness, gloom and storm;
58012019 to a trumpet blast or to such a voice speaking words that those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them,
58012020 because they could not bear what was commanded: “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned to death.”
58012021 The sight was so terrifying that Moses said, “I am trembling with fear.”
58012022 But you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly,
58012023 to the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God, the Judge of all, to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,
58012024 to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.
58012025 See to it that you do not refuse him who speaks. If they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, how much less will we, if we turn away from him who warns us from heaven?
58012026 At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, “Once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens.”
58012027 The words “once more” indicate the removing of what can be shaken—that is, created things—so that what cannot be shaken may remain.
58012028 Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe,
58012029 for our “God is a consuming fire.”
58013001 Keep on loving one another as brothers and sisters.
58013002 Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it.
58013003 Continue to remember those in prison as if you were together with them in prison, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering.
58013004 Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.
58013005 Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, “Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.”
58013006 So we say with confidence, “The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?”
58013007 Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith.
58013008 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
58013009 Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings. It is good for our hearts to be strengthened by grace, not by eating ceremonial foods, which is of no benefit to those who do so.
58013010 We have an altar from which those who minister at the tabernacle have no right to eat.
58013011 The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place as a sin offering, but the bodies are burned outside the camp.
58013012 And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood.
58013013 Let us, then, go to him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace he bore.
58013014 For here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city that is to come.
58013015 Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise—the fruit of lips that openly profess his name.
58013016 And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.
58013017 Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority, because they keep watch over you as those who must give an account. Do this so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no benefit to you.
58013018 Pray for us. We are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to live honorably in every way.
58013019 I particularly urge you to pray so that I may be restored to you soon.
58013020 Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep,
58013021 equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
58013022 Brothers and sisters, I urge you to bear with my word of exhortation, for in fact I have written to you quite briefly.
58013023 I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been released. If he arrives soon, I will come with him to see you.
58013024 Greet all your leaders and all the Lord’s people. Those from Italy send you their greetings.
58013025 Grace be with you all.
59001001 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations: Greetings.
59001002 Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds,
59001003 because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.
59001004 Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.
59001005 If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you.
59001006 But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.
59001007 That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.
59001008 Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do.
59001009 Believers in humble circumstances ought to take pride in their high position.
59001010 But the rich should take pride in their humiliation—since they will pass away like a wild flower.
59001011 For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich will fade away even while they go about their business.
59001012 Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him.
59001013 When tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone;
59001014 but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed.
59001015 Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.
59001016 Don’t be deceived, my dear brothers and sisters.
59001017 Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.
59001018 He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.
59001019 My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry,
59001020 because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires.
59001021 Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you.
59001022 Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.
59001023 Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror
59001024 and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.
59001025 But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do.
59001026 Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless.
59001027 Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.
59002001 My brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not show favoritism.
59002002 Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in.
59002003 If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, “Here’s a good seat for you,” but say to the poor man, “You stand there” or “Sit on the floor by my feet,”
59002004 have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
59002005 Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him?
59002006 But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court?
59002007 Are they not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of him to whom you belong?
59002008 If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.
59002009 But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.
59002010 For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.
59002011 For he who said, “You shall not commit adultery,” also said, “You shall not murder.” If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.
59002012 Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom,
59002013 because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
59002014 What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them?
59002015 Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food.
59002016 If one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,” but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it?
59002017 In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.
59002018 But someone will say, “You have faith; I have deeds.” Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.
59002019 You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder.
59002020 You foolish person, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless ?
59002021 Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
59002022 You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did.
59002023 And the scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,” and he was called God’s friend.
59002024 You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone.
59002025 In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction?
59002026 As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.
59003001 Not many of you should become teachers, my fellow believers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly.
59003002 We all stumble in many ways. Anyone who is never at fault in what they say is perfect, able to keep their whole body in check.
59003003 When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal.
59003004 Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go.
59003005 Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark.
59003006 The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of one’s life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.
59003007 All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and sea creatures are being tamed and have been tamed by mankind,
59003008 but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
59003009 With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse human beings, who have been made in God’s likeness.
59003010 Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers and sisters, this should not be.
59003011 Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring?
59003012 My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.
59003013 Who is wise and understanding among you? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom.
59003014 But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth.
59003015 Such “wisdom” does not come down from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.
59003016 For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every evil practice.
59003017 But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.
59003018 Peacemakers who sow in peace reap a harvest of righteousness.
59004001 What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don’t they come from your desires that battle within you?
59004002 You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God.
59004003 When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.
59004004 You adulterous people, don’t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.
59004005 Or do you think Scripture says without reason that he jealously longs for the spirit he has caused to dwell in us ?
59004006 But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says: “God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.”
59004007 Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
59004008 Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
59004009 Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom.
59004010 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.
59004011 Brothers and sisters, do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against a brother or sister or judges them speaks against the law and judges it. When you judge the law, you are not keeping it, but sitting in judgment on it.
59004012 There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able to save and destroy. But you—who are you to judge your neighbor?
59004013 Now listen, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.”
59004014 Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
59004015 Instead, you ought to say, “If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that.”
59004016 As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes. All such boasting is evil.
59004017 If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it, it is sin for them.
59005001 Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you.
59005002 Your wealth has rotted, and moths have eaten your clothes.
59005003 Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days.
59005004 Look! The wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty.
59005005 You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.
59005006 You have condemned and murdered the innocent one, who was not opposing you.
59005007 Be patient, then, brothers and sisters, until the Lord’s coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting for the autumn and spring rains.
59005008 You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord’s coming is near.
59005009 Don’t grumble against one another, brothers and sisters, or you will be judged. The Judge is standing at the door!
59005010 Brothers and sisters, as an example of patience in the face of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
59005011 As you know, we count as blessed those who have persevered. You have heard of Job’s perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about. The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.
59005012 Above all, my brothers and sisters, do not swear—not by heaven or by earth or by anything else. All you need to say is a simple “Yes” or “No.” Otherwise you will be condemned.
59005013 Is anyone among you in trouble? Let them pray. Is anyone happy? Let them sing songs of praise.
59005014 Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.
59005015 And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven.
59005016 Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.
59005017 Elijah was a human being, even as we are. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years.
59005018 Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops.
59005019 My brothers and sisters, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring that person back,
59005020 remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins.
60001001 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To God’s elect, exiles scattered throughout the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia,
60001002 who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to be obedient to Jesus Christ and sprinkled with his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance.
60001003 Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
60001004 and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade. This inheritance is kept in heaven for you,
60001005 who through faith are shielded by God’s power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.
60001006 In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.
60001007 These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith—of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.
60001008 Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy,
60001009 for you are receiving the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
60001010 Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care,
60001011 trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of the Messiah and the glories that would follow.
60001012 It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things.
60001013 Therefore, with minds that are alert and fully sober, set your hope on the grace to be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed at his coming.
60001014 As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance.
60001015 But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do;
60001016 for it is written: “Be holy, because I am holy.”
60001017 Since you call on a Father who judges each person’s work impartially, live out your time as foreigners here in reverent fear.
60001018 For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your ancestors,
60001019 but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.
60001020 He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake.
60001021 Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him, and so your faith and hope are in God.
60001022 Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for each other, love one another deeply, from the heart.
60001023 For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God.
60001024 For, “All people are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall,
60001025 but the word of the Lord endures forever.” And this is the word that was preached to you.
60002001 Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind.
60002002 Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,
60002003 now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.
60002004 As you come to him, the living Stone—rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to him—
60002005 you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
60002006 For in Scripture it says: “See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.”
60002007 Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, “The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,”
60002008 and, “A stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.” They stumble because they disobey the message—which is also what they were destined for.
60002009 But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.
60002010 Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
60002011 Dear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul.
60002012 Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.
60002013 Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority,
60002014 or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.
60002015 For it is God’s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people.
60002016 Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God’s slaves.
60002017 Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor.
60002018 Slaves, in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh.
60002019 For it is commendable if someone bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because they are conscious of God.
60002020 But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God.
60002021 To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps.
60002022 “He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.”
60002023 When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.
60002024 “He himself bore our sins” in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; “by his wounds you have been healed.”
60002025 For “you were like sheep going astray,” but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
60003001 Wives, in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives,
60003002 when they see the purity and reverence of your lives.
60003003 Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes.
60003004 Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God’s sight.
60003005 For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to adorn themselves. They submitted themselves to their own husbands,
60003006 like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her lord. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear.
60003007 Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.
60003008 Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble.
60003009 Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing.
60003010 For, “Whoever would love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from deceitful speech.
60003011 They must turn from evil and do good; they must seek peace and pursue it.
60003012 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”
60003013 Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good?
60003014 But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. “Do not fear their threats ; do not be frightened.”
60003015 But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect,
60003016 keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander.
60003017 For it is better, if it is God’s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.
60003018 For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit.
60003019 After being made alive, he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits—
60003020 to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water,
60003021 and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
60003022 who has gone into heaven and is at God’s right hand—with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him.
60004001 Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because whoever suffers in the body is done with sin.
60004002 As a result, they do not live the rest of their earthly lives for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God.
60004003 For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do—living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry.
60004004 They are surprised that you do not join them in their reckless, wild living, and they heap abuse on you.
60004005 But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
60004006 For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so that they might be judged according to human standards in regard to the body, but live according to God in regard to the spirit.
60004007 The end of all things is near. Therefore be alert and of sober mind so that you may pray.
60004008 Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.
60004009 Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.
60004010 Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms.
60004011 If anyone speaks, they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God. If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.
60004012 Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.
60004013 But rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed.
60004014 If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.
60004015 If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler.
60004016 However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name.
60004017 For it is time for judgment to begin with God’s household; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God?
60004018 And, “If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?”
60004019 So then, those who suffer according to God’s will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.
60005001 To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow elder and a witness of Christ’s sufferings who also will share in the glory to be revealed:
60005002 Be shepherds of God’s flock that is under your care, watching over them—not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve;
60005003 not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.
60005004 And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.
60005005 In the same way, you who are younger, submit yourselves to your elders. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, “God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.”
60005006 Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time.
60005007 Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.
60005008 Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.
60005009 Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.
60005010 And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast.
60005011 To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen.
60005012 With the help of Silas, whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it.
60005013 She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you her greetings, and so does my son Mark.
60005014 Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
61001001 Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours:
61001002 Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
61001003 His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness.
61001004 Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature, having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.
61001005 For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge;
61001006 and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness;
61001007 and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love.
61001008 For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
61001009 But whoever does not have them is nearsighted and blind, forgetting that they have been cleansed from their past sins.
61001010 Therefore, my brothers and sisters, make every effort to confirm your calling and election. For if you do these things, you will never stumble,
61001011 and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
61001012 So I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have.
61001013 I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body,
61001014 because I know that I will soon put it aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.
61001015 And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things.
61001016 For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
61001017 He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”
61001018 We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain.
61001019 We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
61001020 Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation of things.
61001021 For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
61002001 But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them—bringing swift destruction on themselves.
61002002 Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into disrepute.
61002003 In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping.
61002004 For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them in chains of darkness to be held for judgment;
61002005 if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others;
61002006 if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly;
61002007 and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the depraved conduct of the lawless
61002008 (for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)—
61002009 if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment.
61002010 This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the flesh and despise authority. Bold and arrogant, they are not afraid to heap abuse on celestial beings;
61002011 yet even angels, although they are stronger and more powerful, do not heap abuse on such beings when bringing judgment on them from the Lord.
61002012 But these people blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like unreasoning animals, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, and like animals they too will perish.
61002013 They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you.
61002014 With eyes full of adultery, they never stop sinning; they seduce the unstable; they are experts in greed—an accursed brood!
61002015 They have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Bezer, who loved the wages of wickedness.
61002016 But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey—an animal without speech—who spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet’s madness.
61002017 These people are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them.
61002018 For they mouth empty, boastful words and, by appealing to the lustful desires of the flesh, they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error.
61002019 They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity—for “people are slaves to whatever has mastered them.”
61002020 If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and are overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning.
61002021 It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them.
61002022 Of them the proverbs are true: “A dog returns to its vomit,” and, “A sow that is washed returns to her wallowing in the mud.”
61003001 Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you. I have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking.
61003002 I want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles.
61003003 Above all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires.
61003004 They will say, “Where is this ‘coming’ he promised? Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.”
61003005 But they deliberately forget that long ago by God’s word the heavens came into being and the earth was formed out of water and by water.
61003006 By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed.
61003007 By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.
61003008 But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.
61003009 The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.
61003010 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare.
61003011 Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives
61003012 as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat.
61003013 But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells.
61003014 So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him.
61003015 Bear in mind that our Lord’s patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him.
61003016 He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.
61003017 Therefore, dear friends, since you have been forewarned, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of the lawless and fall from your secure position.
61003018 But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever! Amen.
62001001 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched—this we proclaim concerning the Word of life.
62001002 The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us.
62001003 We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.
62001004 We write this to make our joy complete.
62001005 This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light; in him there is no darkness at all.
62001006 If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth.
62001007 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.
62001008 If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.
62001009 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.
62001010 If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us.
62002001 My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.
62002002 He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.
62002003 We know that we have come to know him if we keep his commands.
62002004 Whoever says, “I know him,” but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person.
62002005 But if anyone obeys his word, love for God is truly made complete in them. This is how we know we are in him:
62002006 Whoever claims to live in him must live as Jesus did.
62002007 Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard.
62002008 Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining.
62002009 Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister is still in the darkness.
62002010 Anyone who loves their brother and sister lives in the light, and there is nothing in them to make them stumble.
62002011 But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness. They do not know where they are going, because the darkness has blinded them.
62002012 I am writing to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name.
62002013 I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.
62002014 I write to you, dear children, because you know the Father. I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
62002015 Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them.
62002016 For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world.
62002017 The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever.
62002018 Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour.
62002019 They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us.
62002020 But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth.
62002021 I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth.
62002022 Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist—denying the Father and the Son.
62002023 No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also.
62002024 As for you, see that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father.
62002025 And this is what he promised us—eternal life.
62002026 I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray.
62002027 As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit—just as it has taught you, remain in him.
62002028 And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming.
62002029 If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.
62003001 See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him.
62003002 Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.
62003003 All who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure.
62003004 Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness.
62003005 But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin.
62003006 No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him.
62003007 Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. The one who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous.
62003008 The one who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil’s work.
62003009 No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God’s seed remains in them; they cannot go on sinning, because they have been born of God.
62003010 This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not God’s child, nor is anyone who does not love their brother and sister.
62003011 For this is the message you heard from the beginning: We should love one another.
62003012 Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brother’s were righteous.
62003013 Do not be surprised, my brothers and sisters, if the world hates you.
62003014 We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love each other. Anyone who does not love remains in death.
62003015 Anyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him.
62003016 This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.
62003017 If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person?
62003018 Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.
62003019 This is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence:
62003020 If our hearts condemn us, we know that God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything.
62003021 Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God
62003022 and receive from him anything we ask, because we keep his commands and do what pleases him.
62003023 And this is his command: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us.
62003024 The one who keeps God’s commands lives in him, and he in them. And this is how we know that he lives in us: We know it by the Spirit he gave us.
62004001 Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
62004002 This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,
62004003 but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.
62004004 You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.
62004005 They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them.
62004006 We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood.
62004007 Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.
62004008 Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.
62004009 This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.
62004010 This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
62004011 Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
62004012 No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.
62004013 This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit.
62004014 And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world.
62004015 If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God.
62004016 And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them.
62004017 This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment: In this world we are like Jesus.
62004018 There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.
62004019 We love because he first loved us.
62004020 Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen.
62004021 And he has given us this command: Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister.
62005001 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well.
62005002 This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands.
62005003 In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are not burdensome,
62005004 for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith.
62005005 Who is it that overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.
62005006 This is the one who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.
62005007 For there are three that testify:
62005008 the Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement.
62005009 We accept human testimony, but God’s testimony is greater because it is the testimony of God, which he has given about his Son.
62005010 Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony. Whoever does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because they have not believed the testimony God has given about his Son.
62005011 And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
62005012 Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.
62005013 I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.
62005014 This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.
62005015 And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him.
62005016 If you see any brother or sister commit a sin that does not lead to death, you should pray and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that you should pray about that.
62005017 All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death.
62005018 We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the One who was born of God keeps them safe, and the evil one cannot harm them.
62005019 We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one.
62005020 We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true. And we are in him who is true by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.
62005021 Dear children, keep yourselves from idols.
63001001 The elder, To the lady chosen by God and to her children, whom I love in the truth—and not I only, but also all who know the truth—
63001002 because of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever:
63001003 Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father’s Son, will be with us in truth and love.
63001004 It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us.
63001005 And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another.
63001006 And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.
63001007 I say this because many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.
63001008 Watch out that you do not lose what we have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully.
63001009 Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.
63001010 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take them into your house or welcome them.
63001011 Anyone who welcomes them shares in their wicked work.
63001012 I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.
63001013 The children of your sister, who is chosen by God, send their greetings.
64001001 The elder, To my dear friend Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
64001002 Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well.
64001003 It gave me great joy when some believers came and testified about your faithfulness to the truth, telling how you continue to walk in it.
64001004 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.
64001005 Dear friend, you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers and sisters, even though they are strangers to you.
64001006 They have told the church about your love. Please send them on their way in a manner that honors God.
64001007 It was for the sake of the Name that they went out, receiving no help from the pagans.
64001008 We ought therefore to show hospitality to such people so that we may work together for the truth.
64001009 I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first, will not welcome us.
64001010 So when I come, I will call attention to what he is doing, spreading malicious nonsense about us. Not satisfied with that, he even refuses to welcome other believers. He also stops those who want to do so and puts them out of the church.
64001011 Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what is good is from God. Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God.
64001012 Demetrius is well spoken of by everyone—and even by the truth itself. We also speak well of him, and you know that our testimony is true.
64001013 I have much to write you, but I do not want to do so with pen and ink.
64001014 I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face. Peace to you. The friends here send their greetings. Greet the friends there by name.
65001001 Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James, To those who have been called, who are loved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ:
65001002 Mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance.
65001003 Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt compelled to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to God’s holy people.
65001004 For certain individuals whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you. They are ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord.
65001005 Though you already know all this, I want to remind you that the Lord at one time delivered his people out of Egypt, but later destroyed those who did not believe.
65001006 And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling—these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day.
65001007 In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.
65001008 In the very same way, on the strength of their dreams these ungodly people pollute their own bodies, reject authority and heap abuse on celestial beings.
65001009 But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said, “The Lord rebuke you!”
65001010 Yet these people slander whatever they do not understand, and the very things they do understand by instinct—as irrational animals do—will destroy them.
65001011 Woe to them! They have taken the way of Cain; they have rushed for profit into Balaam’s error; they have been destroyed in Korah’s rebellion.
65001012 These people are blemishes at your love feasts, eating with you without the slightest qualm—shepherds who feed only themselves. They are clouds without rain, blown along by the wind; autumn trees, without fruit and uprooted—twice dead.
65001013 They are wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shame; wandering stars, for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever.
65001014 Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about them: “See, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones
65001015 to judge everyone, and to convict all of them of all the ungodly acts they have committed in their ungodliness, and of all the defiant words ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”
65001016 These people are grumblers and faultfinders; they follow their own evil desires; they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.
65001017 But, dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold.
65001018 They said to you, “In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires.”
65001019 These are the people who divide you, who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the Spirit.
65001020 But you, dear friends, by building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit,
65001021 keep yourselves in God’s love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life.
65001022 Be merciful to those who doubt;
65001023 save others by snatching them from the fire; to others show mercy, mixed with fear—hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.
65001024 To him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy—
65001025 to the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore! Amen.
66001001 The revelation from Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,
66001002 who testifies to everything he saw—that is, the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.
66001003 Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near.
66001004 John, To the seven churches in the province of Asia: Grace and peace to you from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits before his throne,
66001005 and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood,
66001006 and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father—to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen.
66001007 “Look, he is coming with the clouds,” and “every eye will see him, even those who pierced him”; and all peoples on earth “will mourn because of him.” So shall it be! Amen.
66001008 “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.”
66001009 I, John, your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
66001010 On the Lord’s Day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,
66001011 which said: “Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea.”
66001012 I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands,
66001013 and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man, dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest.
66001014 The hair on his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire.
66001015 His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters.
66001016 In his right hand he held seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.
66001017 When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said: “Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.
66001018 I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades.
66001019 “Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now and what will take place later.
66001020 The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
66002001 “To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands.
66002002 I know your deeds, your hard work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked people, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false.
66002003 You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not grown weary.
66002004 Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken the love you had at first.
66002005 Consider how far you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.
66002006 But you have this in your favor: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
66002007 Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.
66002008 “To the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again.
66002009 I know your afflictions and your poverty—yet you are rich! I know about the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
66002010 Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor’s crown.
66002011 Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who is victorious will not be hurt at all by the second death.
66002012 “To the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These are the words of him who has the sharp, double-edged sword.
66002013 I know where you live—where Satan has his throne. Yet you remain true to my name. You did not renounce your faith in me, not even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death in your city—where Satan lives.
66002014 Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: There are some among you who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin so that they ate food sacrificed to idols and committed sexual immorality.
66002015 Likewise, you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
66002016 Repent therefore! Otherwise, I will soon come to you and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
66002017 Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is victorious, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give that person a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to the one who receives it.
66002018 “To the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze.
66002019 I know your deeds, your love and faith, your service and perseverance, and that you are now doing more than you did at first.
66002020 Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophet. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols.
66002021 I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling.
66002022 So I will cast her on a bed of suffering, and I will make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they repent of her ways.
66002023 I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.
66002024 Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan’s so-called deep secrets, ‘I will not impose any other burden on you,
66002025 except to hold on to what you have until I come.’
66002026 To the one who is victorious and does my will to the end, I will give authority over the nations—
66002027 that one ‘will rule them with an iron scepter and will dash them to pieces like pottery’ —just as I have received authority from my Father.
66002028 I will also give that one the morning star.
66002029 Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
66003001 “To the angel of the church in Sardis write: These are the words of him who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your deeds; you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.
66003002 Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have found your deeds unfinished in the sight of my God.
66003003 Remember, therefore, what you have received and heard; hold it fast, and repent. But if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what time I will come to you.
66003004 Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes. They will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy.
66003005 The one who is victorious will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out the name of that person from the book of life, but will acknowledge that name before my Father and his angels.
66003006 Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
66003007 “To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These are the words of him who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open.
66003008 I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. I know that you have little strength, yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.
66003009 I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars—I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you.
66003010 Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth.
66003011 I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have, so that no one will take your crown.
66003012 The one who is victorious I will make a pillar in the temple of my God. Never again will they leave it. I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God; and I will also write on them my new name.
66003013 Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
66003014 “To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God’s creation.
66003015 I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other!
66003016 So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth.
66003017 You say, ‘I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.’ But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked.
66003018 I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; and white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see.
66003019 Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent.
66003020 Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me.
66003021 To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne.
66003022 Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.”
66004001 After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.”
66004002 At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it.
66004003 And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and ruby. A rainbow that shone like an emerald encircled the throne.
66004004 Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads.
66004005 From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder. In front of the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the seven spirits of God.
66004006 Also in front of the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they were covered with eyes, in front and in back.
66004007 The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle.
66004008 Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under its wings. Day and night they never stop saying: “ ‘Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,’ who was, and is, and is to come.”
66004009 Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever,
66004010 the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say:
66004011 “You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being.”
66005001 Then I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals.
66005002 And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?”
66005003 But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it.
66005004 I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside.
66005005 Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.”
66005006 Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders. The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.
66005007 He went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne.
66005008 And when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of God’s people.
66005009 And they sang a new song, saying: “You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because you were slain, and with your blood you purchased for God persons from every tribe and language and people and nation.
66005010 You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth.”
66005011 Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels, numbering thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand. They encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders.
66005012 In a loud voice they were saying: “Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise!”
66005013 Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, saying: “To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power, for ever and ever!”
66005014 The four living creatures said, “Amen,” and the elders fell down and worshiped.
66006001 I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, “Come!”
66006002 I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest.
66006003 When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Come!”
66006004 Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make people kill each other. To him was given a large sword.
66006005 When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come!” I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand.
66006006 Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures, saying, “Two pounds of wheat for a day’s wages, and six pounds of barley for a day’s wages, and do not damage the oil and the wine!”
66006007 When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!”
66006008 I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.
66006009 When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained.
66006010 They called out in a loud voice, “How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?”
66006011 Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their fellow servants, their brothers and sisters, were killed just as they had been.
66006012 I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red,
66006013 and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind.
66006014 The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.
66006015 Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and everyone else, both slave and free, hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains.
66006016 They called to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!
66006017 For the great day of their wrath has come, and who can withstand it?”
66007001 After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree.
66007002 Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea:
66007003 “Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.”
66007004 Then I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel.
66007005 From the tribe of Judah 12,000 were sealed, from the tribe of Reuben 12,000, from the tribe of Gad 12,000,
66007006 from the tribe of Asher 12,000, from the tribe of Naphtali 12,000, from the tribe of Manasseh 12,000,
66007007 from the tribe of Simeon 12,000, from the tribe of Levi 12,000, from the tribe of Issachar 12,000,
66007008 from the tribe of Zebulun 12,000, from the tribe of Joseph 12,000, from the tribe of Benjamin 12,000.
66007009 After this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands.
66007010 And they cried out in a loud voice: “Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.”
66007011 All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They fell down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,
66007012 saying: “Amen! Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength be to our God for ever and ever. Amen!”
66007013 Then one of the elders asked me, “These in white robes—who are they, and where did they come from?”
66007014 I answered, “Sir, you know.” And he said, “These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
66007015 Therefore, “they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple; and he who sits on the throne will shelter them with his presence.
66007016 ‘Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst. The sun will not beat down on them,’ nor any scorching heat.
66007017 For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; ‘he will lead them to springs of living water.’ ‘And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.’ ”
66008001 When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
66008002 And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
66008003 Another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense to offer, with the prayers of all God’s people, on the golden altar in front of the throne.
66008004 The smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of God’s people, went up before God from the angel’s hand.
66008005 Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it on the earth; and there came peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning and an earthquake.
66008006 Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.
66008007 The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled down on the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
66008008 The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood,
66008009 a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
66008010 The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water—
66008011 the name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter.
66008012 The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them turned dark. A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night.
66008013 As I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a loud voice: “Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels!”
66009001 The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss.
66009002 When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace. The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss.
66009003 And out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth.
66009004 They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
66009005 They were not allowed to kill them but only to torture them for five months. And the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes.
66009006 During those days people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them.
66009007 The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads they wore something like crowns of gold, and their faces resembled human faces.
66009008 Their hair was like women’s hair, and their teeth were like lions’ teeth.
66009009 They had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle.
66009010 They had tails with stingers, like scorpions, and in their tails they had power to torment people for five months.
66009011 They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek is Apollyon (that is, Destroyer).
66009012 The first woe is past; two other woes are yet to come.
66009013 The sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice coming from the four horns of the golden altar that is before God.
66009014 It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.”
66009015 And the four angels who had been kept ready for this very hour and day and month and year were released to kill a third of mankind.
66009016 The number of the mounted troops was twice ten thousand times ten thousand. I heard their number.
66009017 The horses and riders I saw in my vision looked like this: Their breastplates were fiery red, dark blue, and yellow as sulfur. The heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire, smoke and sulfur.
66009018 A third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire, smoke and sulfur that came out of their mouths.
66009019 The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails were like snakes, having heads with which they inflict injury.
66009020 The rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues still did not repent of the work of their hands; they did not stop worshiping demons, and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone and wood—idols that cannot see or hear or walk.
66009021 Nor did they repent of their murders, their magic arts, their sexual immorality or their thefts.
66010001 Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven. He was robed in a cloud, with a rainbow above his head; his face was like the sun, and his legs were like fiery pillars.
66010002 He was holding a little scroll, which lay open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,
66010003 and he gave a loud shout like the roar of a lion. When he shouted, the voices of the seven thunders spoke.
66010004 And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down.”
66010005 Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven.
66010006 And he swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, and said, “There will be no more delay!
66010007 But in the days when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be accomplished, just as he announced to his servants the prophets.”
66010008 Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me once more: “Go, take the scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.”
66010009 So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said to me, “Take it and eat it. It will turn your stomach sour, but ‘in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.’ ”
66010010 I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it. It tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach turned sour.
66010011 Then I was told, “You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages and kings.”
66011001 I was given a reed like a measuring rod and was told, “Go and measure the temple of God and the altar, with its worshipers.
66011002 But exclude the outer court; do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles. They will trample on the holy city for 42 months.
66011003 And I will appoint my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.”
66011004 They are “the two olive trees” and the two lampstands, and “they stand before the Lord of the earth.”
66011005 If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies. This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die.
66011006 They have power to shut up the heavens so that it will not rain during the time they are prophesying; and they have power to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want.
66011007 Now when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the Abyss will attack them, and overpower and kill them.
66011008 Their bodies will lie in the public square of the great city—which is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt—where also their Lord was crucified.
66011009 For three and a half days some from every people, tribe, language and nation will gaze on their bodies and refuse them burial.
66011010 The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts, because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth.
66011011 But after the three and a half days the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and terror struck those who saw them.
66011012 Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies looked on.
66011013 At that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
66011014 The second woe has passed; the third woe is coming soon.
66011015 The seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, which said: “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah, and he will reign for ever and ever.”
66011016 And the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God,
66011017 saying: “We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, the One who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and have begun to reign.
66011018 The nations were angry, and your wrath has come. The time has come for judging the dead, and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your people who revere your name, both great and small— and for destroying those who destroy the earth.”
66011019 Then God’s temple in heaven was opened, and within his temple was seen the ark of his covenant. And there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake and a severe hailstorm.
66012001 A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head.
66012002 She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth.
66012003 Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads.
66012004 Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that it might devour her child the moment he was born.
66012005 She gave birth to a son, a male child, who “will rule all the nations with an iron scepter.” And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne.
66012006 The woman fled into the wilderness to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.
66012007 Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back.
66012008 But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven.
66012009 The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.
66012010 Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: “Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Messiah. For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down.
66012011 They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.
66012012 Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short.”
66012013 When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.
66012014 The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent’s reach.
66012015 Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent.
66012016 But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth.
66012017 Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring—those who keep God’s commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus.
66013001 The dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name.
66013002 The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority.
66013003 One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was filled with wonder and followed the beast.
66013004 People worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, “Who is like the beast? Who can wage war against it?”
66013005 The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise its authority for forty-two months.
66013006 It opened its mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven.
66013007 It was given power to wage war against God’s holy people and to conquer them. And it was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation.
66013008 All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast—all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world.
66013009 Whoever has ears, let them hear.
66013010 “If anyone is to go into captivity, into captivity they will go. If anyone is to be killed with the sword, with the sword they will be killed.” This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of God’s people.
66013011 Then I saw a second beast, coming out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon.
66013012 It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed.
66013013 And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people.
66013014 Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth. It ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived.
66013015 The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed.
66013016 It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads,
66013017 so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.
66013018 This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666.
66014001 Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads.
66014002 And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps.
66014003 And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.
66014004 These are those who did not defile themselves with women, for they remained virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were purchased from among mankind and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb.
66014005 No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless.
66014006 Then I saw another angel flying in midair, and he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth—to every nation, tribe, language and people.
66014007 He said in a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea and the springs of water.”
66014008 A second angel followed and said, “ ‘Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great,’ which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries.”
66014009 A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: “If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives its mark on their forehead or on their hand,
66014010 they, too, will drink the wine of God’s fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. They will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb.
66014011 And the smoke of their torment will rise for ever and ever. There will be no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who receives the mark of its name.”
66014012 This calls for patient endurance on the part of the people of God who keep his commands and remain faithful to Jesus.
66014013 Then I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “they will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them.”
66014014 I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.
66014015 Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud, “Take your sickle and reap, because the time to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.”
66014016 So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.
66014017 Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.
66014018 Still another angel, who had charge of the fire, came from the altar and called in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, “Take your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth’s vine, because its grapes are ripe.”
66014019 The angel swung his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God’s wrath.
66014020 They were trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood flowed out of the press, rising as high as the horses’ bridles for a distance of 1,600 stadia.
66015001 I saw in heaven another great and marvelous sign: seven angels with the seven last plagues—last, because with them God’s wrath is completed.
66015002 And I saw what looked like a sea of glass glowing with fire and, standing beside the sea, those who had been victorious over the beast and its image and over the number of its name. They held harps given them by God
66015003 and sang the song of God’s servant Moses and of the Lamb: “Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are your ways, King of the nations.
66015004 Who will not fear you, Lord, and bring glory to your name? For you alone are holy. All nations will come and worship before you, for your righteous acts have been revealed.”
66015005 After this I looked, and I saw in heaven the temple—that is, the tabernacle of the covenant law—and it was opened.
66015006 Out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues. They were dressed in clean, shining linen and wore golden sashes around their chests.
66015007 Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever.
66015008 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
66016001 Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go, pour out the seven bowls of God’s wrath on the earth.”
66016002 The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land, and ugly, festering sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its image.
66016003 The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it turned into blood like that of a dead person, and every living thing in the sea died.
66016004 The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood.
66016005 Then I heard the angel in charge of the waters say: “You are just in these judgments, O Holy One, you who are and who were;
66016006 for they have shed the blood of your holy people and your prophets, and you have given them blood to drink as they deserve.”
66016007 And I heard the altar respond: “Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and just are your judgments.”
66016008 The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and the sun was allowed to scorch people with fire.
66016009 They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God, who had control over these plagues, but they refused to repent and glorify him.
66016010 The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in agony
66016011 and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, but they refused to repent of what they had done.
66016012 The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East.
66016013 Then I saw three impure spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
66016014 They are demonic spirits that perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty.
66016015 “Look, I come like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake and remains clothed, so as not to go naked and be shamefully exposed.”
66016016 Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.
66016017 The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne, saying, “It is done!”
66016018 Then there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder and a severe earthquake. No earthquake like it has ever occurred since mankind has been on earth, so tremendous was the quake.
66016019 The great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed. God remembered Babylon the Great and gave her the cup filled with the wine of the fury of his wrath.
66016020 Every island fled away and the mountains could not be found.
66016021 From the sky huge hailstones, each weighing about a hundred pounds, fell on people. And they cursed God on account of the plague of hail, because the plague was so terrible.
66017001 One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the punishment of the great prostitute, who sits by many waters.
66017002 With her the kings of the earth committed adultery, and the inhabitants of the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries.”
66017003 Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns.
66017004 The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries.
66017005 The name written on her forehead was a mystery: babylon the great the mother of prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth.
66017006 I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God’s holy people, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus. When I saw her, I was greatly astonished.
66017007 Then the angel said to me: “Why are you astonished? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides, which has the seven heads and ten horns.
66017008 The beast, which you saw, once was, now is not, and yet will come up out of the Abyss and go to its destruction. The inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast, because it once was, now is not, and yet will come.
66017009 “This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits.
66017010 They are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; but when he does come, he must remain for only a little while.
66017011 The beast who once was, and now is not, is an eighth king. He belongs to the seven and is going to his destruction.
66017012 “The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast.
66017013 They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast.
66017014 They will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will triumph over them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings—and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers.”
66017015 Then the angel said to me, “The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations and languages.
66017016 The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire.
66017017 For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to hand over to the beast their royal authority, until God’s words are fulfilled.
66017018 The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.”
66018001 After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor.
66018002 With a mighty voice he shouted: “ ‘Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great!’ She has become a dwelling for demons and a haunt for every impure spirit, a haunt for every unclean bird, a haunt for every unclean and detestable animal.
66018003 For all the nations have drunk the maddening wine of her adulteries. The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries.”
66018004 Then I heard another voice from heaven say: “ ‘Come out of her, my people,’ so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not receive any of her plagues;
66018005 for her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes.
66018006 Give back to her as she has given; pay her back double for what she has done. Pour her a double portion from her own cup.
66018007 Give her as much torment and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself. In her heart she boasts, ‘I sit enthroned as queen. I am not a widow; I will never mourn.’
66018008 Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her: death, mourning and famine. She will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.
66018009 “When the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared her luxury see the smoke of her burning, they will weep and mourn over her.
66018010 Terrified at her torment, they will stand far off and cry: “ ‘Woe! Woe to you, great city, you mighty city of Babylon! In one hour your doom has come!’
66018011 “The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargoes anymore—
66018012 cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet cloth; every sort of citron wood, and articles of every kind made of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron and marble;
66018013 cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, of fine flour and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and carriages; and human beings sold as slaves.
66018014 “They will say, ‘The fruit you longed for is gone from you. All your luxury and splendor have vanished, never to be recovered.’
66018015 The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand far off, terrified at her torment. They will weep and mourn
66018016 and cry out: “ ‘Woe! Woe to you, great city, dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls!
66018017 In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!’ “Every sea captain, and all who travel by ship, the sailors, and all who earn their living from the sea, will stand far off.
66018018 When they see the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim, ‘Was there ever a city like this great city?’
66018019 They will throw dust on their heads, and with weeping and mourning cry out: “ ‘Woe! Woe to you, great city, where all who had ships on the sea became rich through her wealth! In one hour she has been brought to ruin!’
66018020 “Rejoice over her, you heavens! Rejoice, you people of God! Rejoice, apostles and prophets! For God has judged her with the judgment she imposed on you.”
66018021 Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea, and said: “With such violence the great city of Babylon will be thrown down, never to be found again.
66018022 The music of harpists and musicians, pipers and trumpeters, will never be heard in you again. No worker of any trade will ever be found in you again. The sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again.
66018023 The light of a lamp will never shine in you again. The voice of bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again. Your merchants were the world’s important people. By your magic spell all the nations were led astray.
66018024 In her was found the blood of prophets and of God’s holy people, of all who have been slaughtered on the earth.”
66019001 After this I heard what sounded like the roar of a great multitude in heaven shouting: “Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,
66019002 for true and just are his judgments. He has condemned the great prostitute who corrupted the earth by her adulteries. He has avenged on her the blood of his servants.”
66019003 And again they shouted: “Hallelujah! The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever.”
66019004 The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God, who was seated on the throne. And they cried: “Amen, Hallelujah!”
66019005 Then a voice came from the throne, saying: “Praise our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, both great and small!”
66019006 Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing waters and like loud peals of thunder, shouting: “Hallelujah! For our Lord God Almighty reigns.
66019007 Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready.
66019008 Fine linen, bright and clean, was given her to wear.” (Fine linen stands for the righteous acts of God’s holy people.)
66019009 Then the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!” And he added, “These are the true words of God.”
66019010 At this I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, “Don’t do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers and sisters who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For it is the Spirit of prophecy who bears testimony to Jesus.”
66019011 I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges and wages war.
66019012 His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself.
66019013 He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God.
66019014 The armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen, white and clean.
66019015 Coming out of his mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. “He will rule them with an iron scepter.” He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty.
66019016 On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: king of kings and lord of lords.
66019017 And I saw an angel standing in the sun, who cried in a loud voice to all the birds flying in midair, “Come, gather together for the great supper of God,
66019018 so that you may eat the flesh of kings, generals, and the mighty, of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, great and small.”
66019019 Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the rider on the horse and his army.
66019020 But the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who had performed the signs on its behalf. With these signs he had deluded those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. The two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur.
66019021 The rest were killed with the sword coming out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.
66020001 And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key to the Abyss and holding in his hand a great chain.
66020002 He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.
66020003 He threw him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. After that, he must be set free for a short time.
66020004 I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
66020005 (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.
66020006 Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.
66020007 When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison
66020008 and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth—Gog and Magog—and to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore.
66020009 They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God’s people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them.
66020010 And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
66020011 Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence, and there was no place for them.
66020012 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.
66020013 The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what they had done.
66020014 Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death.
66020015 Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.
66021001 Then I saw “a new heaven and a new earth,” for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea.
66021002 I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.
66021003 And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.
66021004 ‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”
66021005 He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making everything new!” Then he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.”
66021006 He said to me: “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life.
66021007 Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my children.
66021008 But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.”
66021009 One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”
66021010 And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.
66021011 It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.
66021012 It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.
66021013 There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three on the west.
66021014 The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
66021015 The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, its gates and its walls.
66021016 The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia in length, and as wide and high as it is long.
66021017 The angel measured the wall using human measurement, and it was 144 cubits thick.
66021018 The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass.
66021019 The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,
66021020 the fifth onyx, the sixth ruby, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth turquoise, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.
66021021 The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of gold, as pure as transparent glass.
66021022 I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.
66021023 The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp.
66021024 The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it.
66021025 On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there.
66021026 The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it.
66021027 Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.
66022001 Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
66022002 down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.
66022003 No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will serve him.
66022004 They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.
66022005 There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever.
66022006 The angel said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord, the God who inspires the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants the things that must soon take place.”
66022007 “Look, I am coming soon! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy written in this scroll.”
66022008 I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing them to me.
66022009 But he said to me, “Don’t do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your fellow prophets and with all who keep the words of this scroll. Worship God!”
66022010 Then he told me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this scroll, because the time is near.
66022011 Let the one who does wrong continue to do wrong; let the vile person continue to be vile; let the one who does right continue to do right; and let the holy person continue to be holy.”
66022012 “Look, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to each person according to what they have done.
66022013 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.
66022014 “Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city.
66022015 Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.
66022016 “I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star.”
66022017 The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let the one who hears say, “Come!” Let the one who is thirsty come; and let the one who wishes take the free gift of the water of life.
66022018 I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this scroll.
66022019 And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are described in this scroll.
66022020 He who testifies to these things says, “Yes, I am coming soon.” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.
66022021 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God’s people. Amen.
