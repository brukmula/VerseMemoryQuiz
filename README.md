<h2>Welcome to Verse Memory Quiz!</h2>

This is a game designed to test your memory skills with Bible verses! 

How to play:

The game goes through a database of random verses, and displays paraphrases of that verse. Based on those paraphrases, you have to enter the original verse that it is paraphrasing. 

Here are some more instructions on the game.
 
<Select Difficulty>
This determines how much of the original verse you need to get right to win. 
For example, if you choose 100%, then you have to get the entire verse correct.
If you choose 50% you have to get half of the verse correct. 
Correctness is measured on content not word count!
The default difficulty is 50%.

<Select Version>
If you have memorized a verse in a specific translation, select it from the dropdown menu, and you will be graded based off of that translation.
The default translation is ESV. 

The [Check Verse] button lets you peek at the original verse in case you forgot it or want to look at it before quizzing yourself.
However, you can only peek at the verse once per round. 

The [New Verse] button selects a new verse at random from the database. When a new verse is selected, your ability to look at the original verse is restored. 

[Change Game Mode]
This game offers two game modes that can be changed at any time.
The first one being the paraphrased version, where you can go through a series of paraphrases of a verse. 
Or you can choose Verse Reference
The change game mode button offers a bit more challenging approach to the game. 
Rather than looking at paraphrases of the original verse, you are given the verse reference instead.
For example, if you are given Genesis 1:1, you are only given the text “Genesis 1:1”
If you can’t remember the contents of the verse there is also a [Themes] button. 
This button let’s you see the main themes of the verse to help you jog your memory. 
You can also use [Check Verse] if you still don’t feel confident, but only once per verse! 

[Show Score]
Right above the area where you enter your guess, is a button called [Show Score]
This button lets you see your score while typing your guess. Click once to display it and click the button again to hide it. 
You need to enter some words before you can see the score change. 

The game will only display the completed verse in the Completed Verse box once your score has reached or surpassed the selected difficulty level. Anything below won’t display.
